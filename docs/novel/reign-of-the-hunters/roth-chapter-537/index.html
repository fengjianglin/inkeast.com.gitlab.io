 <p>Chapter 439 A Victory</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You do not have enough souls.” came the icy cold voice of the system.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Damn it! I should’ve known! This is just like a free trial! Is Fate finally heading towards the pay to win route?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Another system notification chimed in after a few seconds, “Do you wish to summon more troops?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was baffled.&nbsp;<em>Wait, aren’t I out of souls?</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The system chimed in again just then, “Summoning can be done with Souls or experience points.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s expression darkened.&nbsp;<em>You’ve got to be kidding me right?&nbsp;</em>With her souls exhausted, her only option was to summon the Dark Troops with her experience points.&nbsp;<em>Wait, this means that I’ll lose my level!</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But the thought remained in her mind for only the briefest of moments. The outcome of this battle meant life and death to Upwards Ho!.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The winner takes all. This has always been the rule of the world. Failure would mean that Upwards Ho!’s efforts for three years would be put to waste. And Ye Ci did not want to lose.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the price of one of her levels, Ye Ci summoned a troop of Dark Cavalry. To her, experience points were something expendable, as it could easily be regained at a later time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hordes after hordes of Soldiers of Darkness were summoned by Ye Ci. Threw themselves at Latal. While individually weak, the Dark Soldiers were able to push Golden Era and their summoned beast back by sheer numbers alone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Latal’s advance was finally bogged down by the sheer weight of their numbers. It had lost 40% of its hitpoints in a short fifteen minutes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dark Soldiers were like ants swarming on a chocolate cake. Attacks and spells rained down on the beast mercilessly. Due to their sheer numbers, not all of the Dark Soldiers were able to engage Latal in combat directly, and these soldiers turned their attention on the Golden Era players nearby instead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As summoned beings, the Dark Soldiers were not afraid of death. They pressed on despite their horrendous casualties. The only thing they knew was to continue advancing until they met their deaths.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci realized that there was no good or evil in war. Warriors on both sides were fighting for their own cause. And to them, their cause was the righteous one. It was the duty of a warrior to fight to achieve victory, or to die trying.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Leave the rest to me.” she said to Fleeting Time with a glint in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time raised an eyebrow at her, but she shook her head before he could give her a response, “Fleeting Time, you’ve done a lot for me. This is not even you fighting. Please allow me to finish this on my own. I want to finish this with my own strength.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you sure about this?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Ye Ci nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Very well.” Fleeting Time smiled and took a step back. Ye Ci jumped onto Ol’ Six and soared towards the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time stared at Ye Ci as she left, and sighed, “You’re the burden that I wish to carry.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Slaughter and death were everywhere as far as Ye Ci’s eyes could see. She summoned more Dark Soldiers, and the sky was immediately filled with Dark Aerial Cavalry. They began swarming upon the Golden Era players in the skies like locusts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the ground, the Soldiers of Darkness continued throwing themselves at Golden Era along with the alliance players. The ground was dyed red by the endless carnage. But at that moment, Ye Ci was smiling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The scent of sulfur unique to Dark Magic filled the air, mixed in with the smell of blood of the fallen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite their numbers and strengths, Golden Era was crumbling beneath the relentless onslaught of the Dark Soldiers. Ye Ci’s summoned troops swarmed over their defences, and tore gaps between their lines.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Latal finally dropped dead, Golden Era’s defensive line crumbled along with their summoned beast. The alliance players began pouring into Golden Era’s rear, supported by the Dark Soldiers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Victory was in sight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci narrowed her eyes when the Golden Era players began to scatter and run.&nbsp;<em>I bet Breeze is fuming over there. But that has nothing to do with me. There will always be a loser when there is a victor.</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With the Golden Era players already on the run, there was no longer a need to summon more warriors. Ye Ci glanced at the timer. There was only nineteen minutes left before Dark Summoning was over. “Nineteen minutes.” She sent a message to Bai Mo.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by that?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Soldiers of Darkness will disappear in nineteen more minutes. If you move fast, they should be able to help take Sodom.” Ye Ci gave the briefest of explanation as there was simply not enough time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Bai Mo immediately gave the order to attack Sodom.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci then glanced at her level.&nbsp;<em>F*ck, I’m only at lvl53 now?</em> She grimaced. At this point, she knew that the only thing she could do was to wait until the battle was concluded as she would not be much help with her significantly lowered level.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She headed to the safety of the rear lines. She knew where Fleeting Time might be.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And he was there, sitting at the place where she was revived. He smiled at her when he saw her approaching from afar.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci felt helpless as she saw the smile on his face. There was a promise that she could not keep. &nbsp;</p>
