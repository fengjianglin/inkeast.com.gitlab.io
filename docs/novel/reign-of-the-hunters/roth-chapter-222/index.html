 <p><strong>Chapter 205 This Banquet Will Not End Well (Part 2)</strong></p>
 <p>Liu Chang was able to calm down after her fit of anger. She spoke calmly to Ye Ci, “Yup. That’s like two days ago. They came just to brag to my mom about it. They’ve even told her to not cling on too tightly to her money, and learn to make some investments.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci narrowed her eyes and a smile formed on her lips. “Why don’t you invest in Upwards Ho! then? I know you made quite a lot of money recently. You can invest some of them to the guild! Surely Upwards Ho! is as good as or even better than Steel-Blooded Battle Spear?”</p>
 <p>“Heh! As expected of someone like you. You’re always thinking of the guild’s benefit.” Liu Chang rolled her eyes at Ye Ci and laughed, “It’s not that I’ve not thought about it, but I really am short of money right now. I’ll just wait til I earn more.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci did not continue the topic. She walked to the front desk and nodded at the waiter, “May I have the receipt for the Blossoming Wealth compartment?”</p>
 <p>The waiter immediately handed Ye Ci the menu with a smile on his face. Liu Chang, who was curious, inched forward to have a look, “What are you doing? Why are you looking at the receipt?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci did not offer her a respond, an instead spoke to the waiter, “Can I order a few more dishes into our compartment?”</p>
 <p>The restaurant would of course hope that their customers would order more. A menu was immediately handed over to Ye Ci, who ordered some of the most expensive dishes available without much of a glance. “I would like to pay the bill now.” said Ye Ci to the waiter as she closed the menu. She then handed her bank card to the waiter.</p>
 <p>“I’ll chip in as well then.” Liu Chang understood the meaning behind Ye Ci’s action. She pulled her bank card out of her purse, but was stopped by Ye Ci, who shook her head, “Forget about it. Save the money and invest in the guild. I can earn the money real quick anyways. You don’t have to be so courteous.”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang nodded, “Alright then.”</p>
 <p>After paying bill, Ye Ci returned to the compartment with Liu Chang.</p>
 <p>“I don’t really feel like going in.” Liu Chang grumbled when they were at the entrance.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci pulled Liu Chang into the compartment with her, “Come on, are you planning to sit in the toilet until the banquet ends? You don’t have to be all riled up because of them. They’ll receive their retribution soon enough.”</p>
 <p>“The good people always die early, while the wicked ones live on for an eternity.” Liu Chang could only let out a sigh and followed Ye Ci into the private compartment.</p>
 <p>Dong Yin’s father had already finished speaking by the time Ye Ci and Liu Chang entered the room. They were met with silence and a tense atmosphere. The duo immediately became the focus of everyone’s attention as soon as they entered the room. Dong Yin’s father stood up, “Old Ye, your daughter is back. Why don’t you ask for her opinion? Even if you don’t trust my judgement, surely you’ll trust the judgement of your daughter?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was baffled by his words. She turned around and faced her parents, “Dad, mom, what is it? What sort of judgement?”</p>
 <p>Signs of wariness were written all over the faces of Ye Nantian and Zuo Xiaolan. They exchanged looks with each other, and Ye Nantian was the one who spoke up, “Aiya, we’re confused ourselves. Bai Mo, you heard what Uncle Dong said as well. Why don’t you explain it to Little Ci?”</p>
 <p>Bai Mo who was busy digging into his food almost gagged when his name was called. He lifted his head, “Uncle, you want me to explain it to her?”</p>
 <p>“Yup.” Ye Nantian and Zuo Xiaolan nodded their heads, and stared right at Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was flustered. She had suddenly became the center of attention of every single person in the room. She cleared her throat and looked at Bai Mo, “So… You have something to tell me?”</p>
 <p>Bai Mo let out a sigh. Before he could speak up, the door of the private compartment opened, and a number of waiters walked into the room, serving up a number of dishes, filling up the already empty table. All the dishes were exotic and luxurious. One could tell that the food was very expensive just by judging from the looks of the plates alone.</p>
 <p>The attendees were stunned into silence, and Dong Yin was the first to react, “Oi, did you guys enter the wrong room? All the dishes that we’ve ordered has been served.”</p>
 <p>“No, this food was ordered by your Blossoming Wealth compartment.” the head waitress said with a smile as she served the food.</p>
 <p>Dong Yin’s mother stood up immediately, “No, we did not order these dishes.” Her expression darkened when she took a look at the freshly served food.</p>
 <p>“Yup, we did not order this. You must’ve been mistaken! Remove them at once or I will file a complaint on you!” Yi Cang’s mother stood up as well. She even attempted to shove one of the plates back into the head waitress’s hand.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci, on the other hand, wedged a piece of venison between her chopsticks and placed it into her bowl, and another piece straight into her mouth. Yi Cang glared at Ye Ci with towering rage, “Did you not hear that, Ye Ci? We did not order these! Why have you started eating? Do you know just how much these dishes cost?”</p>
 <p>Ye Nantian and Zuo Xiaolan turned pale when the heard Yi Cang’s voice. “What are you doing! Behave yourself!” they attempted to stop Ye Ci, and smiled apologetically at the parents of Yi Cang and Dong Yin, “We’re sorry, we will pay for these di-”</p>
 <p>“Can you even afford it?” Yi Cang slammed his fist onto the table, “These are abalone, shark fin, and even swallow’s nest! Any of these dishes is worth your monthly salary! Will you be able to pay for them?”</p>
 <p>Yi Cang’s words were full of disdain and disgust. When Ye Ci thought back to this incident, she came to a conclusion: Yi Cang’s words represented what his and Dong Yin’s parents truly felt about the parents of Ye Ci and Liu Chang. If that would not bet the case, they would not have remained silent when Yi Cang threw his tantrum. No matter what plans Dong Yin parents might have had for organizing the banquet, it was a fact that they thought themselves to be superior.</p>
 <p>“You take that back!” Bai Mo stood up as well, “We have adults here, and who are you to speak when none of them have spoken?” Bai Mo snorted and scanned the faces of the adults, “Is this how things work in your house? The youngsters can just behave rudely without fearing repercussions? Is this how you educate your child?”</p>
 <p>“I dare you to say that again!” Yi Cang was fairly afraid of Bai Mo, but the presence of his parents gave him the courage to roar out at Bai Mo.</p>
 <p>“Just what you think you’re doing Yi Cang? Respect your elders! Shut up and sit down!” Yi Cang’s father could no longer remain quiet when he heard Bai Mo’s words. He would lose face in front of so many waiters if he did not discipline his son.</p>
 <p>Yi Cang was flustered. He sat down and glared at Bai Mo, “Just you wait, Bai Mo.”</p>
 <p>“Shut up!” Yi Cang’s father roared at his son again, and then turn around to face the lead waitress. He offered her an apologetical smile and started, “You see, we did not order these dishes. We will pay for the ones that we have touched, and you return the rest, how about that?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was still munching away at the venison despite the ongoing argument. The meat was just so nice. It was worth the price. She spoke up softly, “Put everything down, I was the one who ordered those.”</p>
 <p>“Ye Ci! Do you really think you can order anything you want just because you’re not paying for it? Do you know just how much they cost?” everybody present were stunned when they heard Ye Ci’s words. Even Dong Yin who has remained silent throughout the ordeal spoke up against Ye Ci, “Even if my family was the one who invited all of you to dinner, we’ve already ordered all the dishes. If you’re not satisfied with the food, you could’ve just told us! We could order more! We do you have to act on your own accord?”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang who was holding in her anger all this while finally lost her temper. She snorted coldly at Dong Yin, “Ye Ci has already paid for everything, so why can’t she eat what she paid for? Have you seen what you ordered for us? Those are like food for beggars!”</p>
 <p>Dong Yin’s anger dissipated immediately. She was frozen in place, and her face was flushing with a bright shade of red. The waiters glanced at the dishes subconsciously after listening to Liu Chang’s words. The food that was served previously was indeed more common compared to the dishes they had just served.</p>
 <p>Dong Yin’s father could no longer stand the embarrassment. He pulled his daughter down back into her seat, “You silly girl, don’t you speak out of turn!” He then smiled at Ye Ci, “Little Ci, you should’ve told uncle that you do not like the food. I was the one who was going to treat everybody to a meal, so why don’t you let uncle pay for the food?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci narrowed her eyes and spoke softly, “It’s just a meal. It doesn’t matter who’s paying, does it? I’m a person of the younger generation, so just think of it as me fulfilling my filial duties. It’s nothing.”</p>
 <p>The face of Dong Yin’s father darkened when he heard Ye Ci’s words. Just then, she head waitress nodded at Ye Ci with a smile, “Miss, we’ve served everything that you ordered, is there anything else you need?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci glanced at the dishes that had just been served. They were nowhere as lavish as the food she used to have in her past life, but her parents would definitely be alarmed by the price of the food. Despite her intention to deliver some face-slapping to the families of Dong Yin and Yi Cang, she still had to take her parents into consideration. Ye Ci nodded and ordered two slightly more expensive dessert, “Bring them in when we’re almost done with our meal.” and she handed a few banknotes to the head waitress, “Thank you for your hard work.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, miss.” the head waitress accepted the tip with a broad smile and left the room.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s movements were fluid and natural. It was as if she was used to doing such a thing. Even Bai Mo was surprised. Since when has she learned to act like this?</p>
 <p>They would never know that Ye Ci acquired it from her extravagant way of life in her past life. Despite her present self, her elegance would surface occasionally, just like this time.</p>
 <p>“I believe you have something to tell me?” Ye Ci turned around and faced Bai Mo.</p>
 <p>Bai Mo snapped out of his daze, and relayed the words of Dong Yin’s father to Ye Ci. According to him, both the families of Dong Yin and Yi Cang have invested in Steel-Blooded Battle Spear, giving their support to Thousand Sunsets.</p>
 <p>The parents of Dong Yin and Yi Cang were quick to find out that Ye Ci was actually Gongzi You, and that ‘Upwards Ho!’ has secured a First Blood for Castle Ruins. Just like any other human being, they were not going to just let their money go to waste. They had to do something to help Thousand Sunsets out. Without prior knowledge that Dong Yin and Yi Cang had a fall out with Ye Ci and Liu Chang, they decided to organize a banquet, and hoped to pressure Ye Ci’s parents into persuading their daughter to offer her aid.</p>
 <p>Of course, those were not the words of the father of Dong Yin, nor were they spoken by Bai Mo. It was a conclusion made by Ye Ci after calmly listening to Bai Mo’s explanation. She raised her eyebrows and studied Bai Mo’s expression, which further confirmed her theory.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was very sure that if they had a private messaging channel in real life, the following would be their conversation:</p>
 <p>“You must be kidding! They really said that?”</p>
 <p>“Yup, that’s what they said!”</p>
 <p>“Why won’t they give up?”</p>
 <p>“In this world, only the shameless will survive. Those who are honorable will slowly die off.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Yup. That would definitely be their conversation.</p>
 <p>When Bai Mo was finally done, Dong Yin’s father spoke up before Ye Nantian and Zuo Xiaolan could react, “Little Ci, I’m sure you understand the situation.</p>
 <p>“Of course.” a ghost of a smile appeared on Ye Ci’s lips. She was not an idiot, of course she would understand everything. Unfortunately for them, her mind was already set. There was nothing they could say or do that would change her mind.</p>
 <p>“So what do you think?” the eyes of Dong Yin’s father were filled with desperation. It was exactly the desperation a starving beggar looking at a sumptuous meal through the glass window of a shop would show.</p>
 <p>“I think…”</p>
 <p>Before Ye Ci could even complete her sentence, she was cut off by the boisterous laughter of Dong Yin’s father, “Aiya, I know Little Ci is a good child. You see, you’re such a good friend of Dong Yin, and our families have been friends for ages! Uncle know that you will definitely help uncle out right?” the man then turned to his daughter and smiled, “See? I told you that you can talk to Little Ci. She’s such a good girl. She agreed to help right away. Why didn’t you ask for her help earlier on?”</p>
 <p>The laughter of Dong Yin’s father reverberated in the entire room, accompanied by the the laughter of Yi Cang’s father. The same could not be said for Ye Nantian, Zuo Xiaolan, and Liu Chang’s parents, with their mouths twitching in annoyance.</p>
 <p>Dong Yin and Yi Cang were silent as well. Dong Yin stared right at Ye Ci. She had already been humiliated by Ye Ci’s words, and she was even more embarrassed by her father’s actions. She studied Ye Ci’s face anxiously. She knew that Ye Ci would not agree to help, but she was filled with hope at the same time. Maybe, just maybe… Ye Ci might help out at her father’s request….</p>
 <p>That was why Dong Yin stared at Ye Ci’s face. She wanted a confirmation from Ye Ci, but she was offered none. Ye Ci’s face betrayed not even a single shred of emotion.</p>
 <p>“Little Ci, since you’ve agreed to help, why don’t you help Steel-Blooded Battle Spear out today when you log into the game? I’ve heard from Yin Yin and Yi Cang that you’re very good at the game. Steel-Blooded Battle Spear will be able to secure a spot in the First Five with your help. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci remained silent. She spun the spinny spinny thing&nbsp;around, bringing the shark fin soup in front of her. After ladling some of the soup into her bowl, Ye Ci sighed as she looked at Liu Chang, “Oh dear, I should not have ordered this. Sharks are an endangered species. A shark has to die in the process of making this. How shameful!”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang rolled her eyes, “You sly fox.”</p>
 <p>Dong Yin’s father was humiliated by Ye Ci. He stared at Ye Nantian and Zuo Xiaolan with a darkened expression and spoke with warning clear in his voice, “Old Ye…”</p>
 <p>Ye Nantian paid no heed to him as well. He mirrored his daughter’s action, and began partaking in the meal. The dishes on the table were paid for by his beloved daughter, and it would be such a waste if he did not savor the food. Zuo Xiaolan, on the other hand, turned around and started a conversation with Liu Chang’s mother, pretending that she did not notice the expression of Dong Yin’s father.</p>
