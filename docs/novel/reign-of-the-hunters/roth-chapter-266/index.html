 <p><strong>Chapter 227 Bon Voyage (Part 2)</strong></p>
 <p>In Fate, only Clerics, Priests, and Druids were capable of healing, with the Cleric being the best among the 3 classes with its mass healing and sustained healing abilities. However, when it came to single target healing spells, the Priest was more capable than its counterparts. Despite its shortcomings when it came to mass healing, the Priest class was equipped with many abilities to dispel debuffs, and could deal massive damage to Undead enemies. This placed the Priest in an important role in party when it came to removing debuffs. A Priest’s healing spell would only be utilized in very specific situations. The Druid, on the other hand, was the most balanced among the 3 classes. It could be said as the jack of all trades. The Druid was a class that could easily be learned but was hard to master. It was even harder to be an expert.</p>
 <p>The Priest class is not totally devoid of mass healing spells, but such skillbooks was very rare at the lvl60 stage of the game, and would only be dropped by BOSSes that were above lvl70 with a very low drop rate. To make matters worse, the trainer NPCs for the Priest class were few and far between.</p>
 <p>We’ve talked about the drop rate.</p>
 <p>We all know that when an item has a 1% drop rate, it does not necessary mean that the item will drop after the 100th time.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was bewildered.<em> Did I mistook it for a Cleric skillbook instead?</em> She rubbed her eyes and stared at the skillbook. She was not mistaken. It was a skillbook of the Priest class.</p>
 <p>God must be sleeping! thought Ye Ci to herself. She could not believe her good luck.</p>
 <p><em>How much can I sell this skillbook for?</em> Ye Ci could not even begin the price the skillbook would fetch her. It was definitely not affordable by the a normal player, but when it came to the major guilds… A Priest with Mass Healing and strong single target heal spells is an overpowered existence.</p>
 <p>The reward was indeed worthy of the time and energy spent by Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>With the map safely in her inventory, Ye Ci made her way to Ha’er. She did not want to spend a single second longer in the mine shaft. The only thing in her mind was to complete her quest with the Black Iron Dwarves and unlock the Mithril ore vein. The process was taking too long. If things continued to drag on, even Ye Ci would lose interest.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! My dear Elven friend, you’re a good friend! I knew you’d make it!” Ha’er was overjoyed to receive the map. He began comparing the map with his surroundings, trying his best to locate the Mithirl ore vein.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci, with her patience exhausted, finally spoke up, “Mister Ha’ar, I think Miss Jasmine is still waiting for news from us. What should I tell her?”</p>
 <p>It was obvious that Ha’er was someone with best memories. Ye Ci’s words brought sudden realisation to Ha’er. He handed his pickaxe to Ye Ci after a brief explanation, and sent her on her way to Jasmine.</p>
 <p>Jasmine was excited when she saw the pickaxe, and her excitement rubbed off on Dudu as well. After a short discussion, Ye Ci led the dwarves in a 3 hours journey to Da’er’s camp site. The dwarves then spent a full hour in celebration before finally setting out to look for the ore vein.</p>
 <p>Due to their relationship with Ye Ci, the dwarves allowed Ye Ci to tag along on their search for the ore vein. It was already midnight in-game as they set out in search for the ore vein. The moon was barely visible in the Lesser Demon Sanctuary, but Ye Ci was in glee. <em>Did the Golden Age player felt the same thing when he discovered the Mithril ore vein back then?</em></p>
 <p>However, there was one thing that Ye Ci was sure of: the player who discovered the ore vein did not know that his discovery would bring turmoil to Fate in the future.</p>
 <p><em>But how about now? How about this life? Will the effects brought by the coming of Golden Age change because of my reincarnation?</em> it was a question that Ye Ci was worried of. Then again, it was meaningless to ponder upon such a question.</p>
 <p>One must not waste energy thinking about something that one could not foresee.</p>
 <p>Ha’er, Jasmine, and Dudu began their long process of probing for the Mithril ore vein. It would take 10 days in real life before the Dwarves would be able to complete the process.<em> It seems that mining for Mithril, a material that could allow players to control the future of Fate, was not a simple task at all.</em> Ye Ci found the following words in her quest description: “The Black Iron Dwarves are searching for the Mithril ore vein, please be patient. You can pay them a visit once the process is complete. It is a long and slow process, perhaps the Dwarves do not wish to be disturbed.”</p>
 <p>There was nothing else written in the description. This meant that the Dwarves did not require Ye Ci’s protection during the process, which also meant that there was no need for Ye Ci to remain in the place for 10 days. She then made the decision to log out of the game. After all, she had received multiple notifications from her gaming cabin. She did not have the chance to go offline as she was busy with the quest.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci walked into Zuo Xiaolan who as she walked out of her room after going offline. “You’re finally willing to logout? I’ve been trying to get you to eat dinner!” said Zuo Xiaolan who creased her eyebrows.</p>
 <p>“I had a quest.” replied Ye Ci as she stretched her body. Even if it was not physically taxing to play Fate, the game could be mentally exhausting, “You made so much of a hassle just to get me to eat dinner?”</p>
 <p>“Yup. And Bai Mo wants to talk to you about something.” said Zuo Xiaolan as she headed for her bedroom, “Go, eat up. Bai Mo’s waiting for you at the balcony. Your dad and I are going to sleep now. You should go to bed too after your meal.”</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Ye Ci gave her mother a nod and limped into the kitchen to heat up the dishes.</p>
 <p>“I’ll do it. You take a seat.” Bai Mo followed Ye Ci into the kitchen. He led Ye Ci to one of the chairs after setting up the table.</p>
 <p>The scenery on the balcony was perfect. The moon was shining down with its full bloom, flooding the balcony with its silvery glow.</p>
 <p>“You’ve got something that you want to say to me?” Ye Ci could feel her stomach rumbling with hunger. Hunger was something that she was unable to stand. She barely ate due to the long hours spent on completing the quest, and was extremely hungry at that very moment.</p>
 <p>Bai Mo gazed at Ye Ci without answering, and offered his own question with a smile instead, “What have you been up to today? I did not see you around.”</p>
 <p>“I came across an ore vein.” Ye Ci did not keep the secret from Bai Mo, “A Mithril ore vein.”</p>
 <p>“Nani?” Bai Mo was shocked by Ye Ci’s revelation. Disbelief was written all over his face as he stared at Ye Ci. It was something that he did not expect. He then looked up into the sky, then at Ye Ci, before looking up into the night sky again and finally settling his gaze on Ye Ci, “Did I hear what you said correctly? Get out of here! A Mithril ore vein?”</p>
 <p>“Yup. That is correct.” said Ye Ci as she took another bite of her food. She smiled as she noticed the shocked expression on Bai Mo’s face.</p>
 <p>“Mithril? As in the Mithril we were talking to me about earlier? As in M-i-t-h-r-i-l?” Bai Mo could still not bring himself to believe Ye Ci’s words. Of course, he was not the one to be blamed. Anybody else would have doubted the information that Ye Ci had just revealed.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Exactly!” Ye Ci rolled her eyes, “It’s exactly the rare material that we were talking about earlier!”</p>
 <p>“How did you find it?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci recited her adventures to Bai Mo with a smile on her face. Of course, told Bai Mo that it was a totally unintentional discovery as she wandered around the map.</p>
 <p>“Look at you! Everybody was saying that you have bad luck, and judging from the loot drops during out dungeon explorations, you are indeed and unlucky person. Then again, if you’re truly unlucky, why do you keep running into good things? An Epic-tier quest, an Epic-tier pet, and even the Mithril ore vein.” Bai Mo rubbed his chin and studied Ye Ci with a surprised expression, “Are you… Some sort of transmigrator?” the words left Bai Mo’s mouth without warning.</p>
 <p>“Cough cough cough.” Ye Ci almost choked on the rice. She coughed violently as her face turned into a shade of red. Bai Mo was not far off the mark by calling her a transmigrator. There’s really not much of a difference between a transmigrator and a reincarnator anyways. Of course, it was something that Ye Ci could not admit. “Bai Mo, you’re a man with high academical qualifications, how could you say something that even a 5 year old would not believe?” said Ye Ci with a rigid smile.</p>
 <p>Bai Mo shrugged at Ye Ci. A figure entered the living room before he could respond. It was Tan Polang. “Aiya! You’re eating supper? Wait up, I want some too!” said Tan Polang with glee clear in his voice as he spotted Ye Ci and Bai Mo, and the plates of dishes on the dining table.</p>
 <p>He then ran into the kitchen and came rushing back into the living room with a bowl full of rice.</p>
 <p>“Eh? You haven’t had your dinner as well?” Ye Ci stared at Tan Polang incredulously.</p>
 <p>“Do you think that I’m like you? I was hungry after my study session. I’m going to sleep after this.” said Tan Polang as he sat down by the table. “How’s your leg doing?” asked the youth as he cast a glance at Ye Ci’s leg.</p>
 <p>“It still hurts a little. It’s no big deal.” said Ye Ci as she stared at the huge bowl of rice in front of Tan Polang, “Why are you eating so much before going to sleep? Aren’t you afraid that you’ll grow to be as fat as a pig?”</p>
 <p>“Why should I? I’m still young! You old folks are the ones who should be careful!” replied Tan Polang as he wolfed down his meal, “Especially you, sister Ye Ci! As a woman, you should be careful with what you eat, or you’ll grow fat without noticing!”</p>
 <p>Bai Mo stared silently at the exchange and the ghost of a smile appeared on his face, “Enjoy the meal, you two. I’m going to sleep.” said Bai Mo as he stood up, “Polang, don’t forget to clean up the dishes when you’re done, and carry Little Ci back into her room.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Brother Mo! You don’t have to remind me.” responded Tan Polang with a salute and a smug grin on his face, “Have a safe journey tomorrow!”</p>
 <p><em>A safe journey?</em> Ye Ci creased her eyebrows <em>What’s going on?</em> “Bai Mo, don’t you have something to tell me?” she immediately called up to Bai Mo.</p>
 <p>“Ah, it’s nothing. I have to head home tomorrow.” answered Bai Mo with a smile.</p>
 <p><em>He’s going home?</em> worry filled Ye Ci’s heart.<em> Maybe I’m just thinking too much into it,</em> thought Ye Ci to herself. But a thought surfaced in her mind: <em>Is Bai Mo really just going home? Or… Is he finally making a move against Dong Yin?</em></p>
 <p>However, the question did not leave Ye Ci’s mouth. She furrowed her eyebrows and stared at Bai Mo for a long moment before finally speaking up, “So it’s just a simple trip back home?”</p>
 <p>Bai Mo, of course, knew the meaning behind Ye Ci’s words. The smile on Bai Mo’s face was like a mountain covered by fog and cloud in the morning. She was unable to discern the true intention behind his smile.”</p>
 <p>“Of course. I might also go on some blind dates, and hook up with some pretty ladies. Why? Are you worried?” said Bai Mo.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was not convinced. She lowered her head and extended her chopstick to the plate of dish in front of her, “A desperate rabbit will bite, and a cornered dog will jump over the wall. Don’t go overboard.”</p>
 <p>The smile disappeared from Bai Mo’s face. He took in a deep breath, and patted Ye Ci on the head, “I know.”</p>
 <p>“Be careful.”</p>
 <p>“You too.” Ye Ci did not lift her head. She could feel the warmth from Bai Mo’s touch fading away from her head, and she heard Bai Mo’s steady footsteps heading to his room, followed by the opening and closing of his bedroom door.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was deathly silent.</p>
 <p><em>Bai Mo will be alright</em> Ye Ci took in a deep breath. The incident in her past life was like a vivid nightmare that was constantly haunting her. It was a huge boulder than was pressing down on her heart.</p>
 <p>She felt a sudden sliver of warmth, and found her shivering hands enveloped by Tan Polang’s tanned hands, “Brother Mo will be alright.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci lifted her head, and stared at Tan Polang. He was smiling at her, “Sister Ye Ci, Brother Mo is more capable than you think. He’s way calmer and more mature than you think he is. He will be alright. Just believe in him, like how he has always believed in you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was momentarily stunned. She did not expect the words from Tan Polang. She had always thought of Tan Polang as the family member who knew the least about that incident. She was wrong. Tan Polang knew, but he chose to remain silent. Perhaps he was not as naive as she thought he was. His intelligence and maturity was something that she had overlooked.</p>
