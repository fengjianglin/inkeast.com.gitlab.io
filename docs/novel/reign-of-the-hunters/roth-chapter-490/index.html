 <p>Chapter 392 You Owe Me An Explanation</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re not?” Huang Qi refused to believe what he heard, but what could he do when the man himself had denied his identity. He directed his gaze to Tan Polang instead, “PPLL, did you not just now?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Polang shrugged and smiled at the man, “I think you’re mistaken, Mr.Huang. I did not.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Huang Qi could only smile awkwardly at the duo, “I apologize. Your playstyles do look alike. Of course, I’m not here because of that.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And King raised an eyebrow at Huang Qi, “What do you want?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I can see that you’re a very good player. Our company is forming a team to take part in the world championship. Would you like to join our team?” Huang Qi grinned at King. The company’s professional team ranked in the top ten within the country. It was very likely that they would qualify for the world championship.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But King did not even take a moment to consider his proposal, “Sorry, I’m not interested.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Huang Qi was not surprised by his rejection, “Please hear me out. I’m from the Flames of War pro team, and our team is currently ranked fourth in the country. If you’re willing to join us, your salary will…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, but I’m really not interested.” King was not even listening to Huang Qi. He looked at the onlookers that were still growing in number and said to Tan Polang, “You want to have a drink somewhere?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Sure.” Tan Polang nodded. They were currently not in a place that was suitable for a conversation, “I’ll lead the way.” the boy had a smile on his face as he pushed his way through the crowd.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>King followed behind Tan Polang, and turned around to smile at Ye Ci, “Are you coming as well?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;<em>Of course I have to go with you two! I forgot my wallet! I’ll have to walk home if I’m not with Tan Polang!&nbsp;</em>And she nodded at King. She did not know why, but she felt a hint of warmth as he looked into his eyes.&nbsp;<em>Do I know him? I don’t think so. But..</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What is this strange feeling?</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Please wait, CM001! Are you not going to think about it? It’ll be a waste of your skills to not put it on the international stage!” shouted Huang Qi.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Letting Tan Polang pick a spot was apparently the wrong decision.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While he was a skilful player in Fate, he was still a child at heart. The place he chose was a super cute ice cream shop.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s expression darkened when she saw the pink themed shop.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>King apparently shared the same thought, “Do you want to go in?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci immediately shook her head, making it very clear that she did not like places like this. The two of them stood smiling at Tan Polang and spoke in near synchronization, “Can we go somewhere else?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why? The ice cream here is nice!” Tan Polang tilted his head at them, “My classmates love this place!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci pursed her lips, “It’s winter. Are you sure you want to have ice cream?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And King came up with an excuse of his own, “I’ve not eaten ice cream since I was eighteen years old.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Polang looked at Ye Ci, then at King, before giving them a meaningful smile. He walked away from the shop’s entrance and said, “Why don’t you two pick a place?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And that was how the trio ended up in a coffee shop. Tan Polang smiled at Ye Ci once they had taken their seats, “Sister Ye Ci, this is the King that I’ve been talking about. He took good care of me when I was still in the national team. He’s the reigning champion for five years!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci felt a sense of familiarity as she stared at King. “Why did you quit?” she asked after Tan Polang was done with his introduction.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>King smiled at Ye Ci. He was not offended by the question at all, “Because I ran out of opponents.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci raised an eyebrow at him. He was arrogant, and he reminded him of a person she knew.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And King continued, “I waited for someone who could best me for five years. But it turned out to be a waste of time. Life is short, I can’t afford to wait any longer.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You remind me of someone.” Ye Ci lowered her gaze. She could still remember how Fleeting Time disappeared from Fate in her last life after winning becoming the PVP Champion.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh? And who is that?” a smile spread across King’s lips.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A rival of mine.” some things could not be said to a person that one had just met. And this was why Ye Ci felt slightly awkward when the words left her mouth, “And perhaps something else as well.” she continued after a slight pause.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Polang’s gaze drifted between the two. And he pulled out his phone after he was sure that the two did not mind the presence of a lightbulb like him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ye Ci is your name?” asked King.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Ye Ci nodded, “Aren’t you going to introduce yourself?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>King chuckled at that question. He held out his hand, “I’m Yi Qingchen.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci shook his hand lightly and immediately let go.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yi Qingchen could feel a shiver traveling down his spine when Ye Ci’s cold fingers brushed against his. He stared silently at her with a charming smile on his face before speaking up, “Little Gongzi, I’m Fleeting Time.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was still in a daze even when she was on the bus ride home. It all felt like a dream to her.&nbsp;<em>How is this possible! How can the Fleeting Time of the Western Continent, the Fleeting Time who is my rival, the Fleeting Time who would not stop harassing me, and the Fleeting Time who I decided to try liking appear in my life so suddenly?</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This... This does not make sense!</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was able to eventually recover from the shock. And once her rational mind returned to her, she began to realise that something was not right.&nbsp;<em>She has not told Fleeting Time where she was. The chances of them running into each other in real life was next to zero.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Hold up…</em> A frown appeared on Ye Ci’s face. Fleeting Time = Yi Qingchen = King = five-time world champion = Tan Polang’s former teammate.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She turned an icy glare towards Tan Polang.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The boy, who could feel her cold gaze on him, was trying his best to pretend to not notice the stare. With trembling hands, he began turning up the volume of the song that was being played on his phone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I did not see that! I did not see that!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Tan Polang, don’t you think you owe me an explanation?” Ye Ci placed her left hand under her chin and drummed the fingers of her right hand on her knee. Her voice was soft, but the pressure that it exerted on Tan Polang was tremendous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this point, the boy was even beginning to hum along to the music.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Hang in there Tan Polang! Just keep feigning ignorance! There’s nothing she can do to you! Hahahahaha…&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just then, the music in his ears stopped abruptly. He turned around, and saw his earphones in Ye Ci’s hand. He shivered when he noticed the sinister smile on her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The boy visibly gulped and stared back at Ye Ci, “Sister Ye…” he blinked. His only chance of survival was to appeal to the benevolence of the demon beside him.&nbsp;</p>
