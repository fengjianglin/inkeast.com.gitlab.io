 <p>Chapter 365 Refusal&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Duplicate names were not allowed in Fate, and there was only one Death Blossom that Ye Ci knew.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was the Death Blossom of Golden Era. She was the wife of Breeze. And she was the top Rogue in her last life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But there was still something Ye Ci could not understand. She had never interacted much with Death Blossom other than their short encounter at the Sea of Sand. She was also an enemy of Golden Era.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, another very important factor was that Ye Ci was in the Western Continent, and Death Blossom was a player from the Eastern Continent. This meant that the Rogue would not be able to send her a message if she was not on either the Western or Middle Continent.&nbsp;<em>Wait, so where is she now?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you on the Western Continent?” she asked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Death Blossom was momentarily stunned. She did not expect the question from Ye Ci, “As expected of Gongzi You. You were able to guess my location.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you somewhere near me?”&nbsp;<em>Since Death Blossom is in the Western Continent,&nbsp;</em>Ye Ci reasoned,<em>&nbsp;it’s only natural that she would be somewhere near the battlefield.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m at a place where I can spot you easily, but you can’t see me.” Death Blossom chuckled. She loved dealing with people who were smart. It saves time and energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci carefully studied her surroundings, but was not able to spot Death Blossom. The Rogue had hidden herself well, “What do you want from me?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Would you believe me if I tell you that I’m merely greeting you? After all, we’re from the same continent!” Death Blossom smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci chuckled at her words, “That’s a good excuse. If you’re willing to believe it, then I will too.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Death Blossom chuckled as well before, “I’m afraid that you won’t believe my words even if I do.” her voice was soft, and Ye Ci could not hear her clearly, but she did not bother to ask. To Ye Ci, there was nothing to discuss between Death Blossom and herself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And Death Blossom knew that Gongzi You was not interested in continuing the conversation as well.&nbsp;<em>This is not easy at all</em>. She sighed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If it’s convenient for you, why don’t you come down here? I’d like to talk to you.” said Death Blossom and she left Stealth. Ye Ci then realised that Death Blossom was hiding in a hole while in Stealth.<em>&nbsp;So that’s why I can’t find her.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I don’t think there’s anything that can be discussed between us.” Ye Ci immediately rejected the proposal. She was at work, it would not be wise to leave her post as it meant that she would be putting her three thousand elites at risk. She was never a person with a strong sense of curiosity, which was why she did not find the need to talk to the second in command of Golden Era.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Death Blossom was at a loss for words. She did not expect her proposal to immediately be rejected by Ye Ci.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you curious at all?” she asked after finally recovering from her shock.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci lowered Ol’ Six and hovered above Death Blossom, “Not at all.” she said with a smile, and Death Blossom’s expression immediately darkened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Death Blossom let out a sigh. She knew from the beginning that it would not be easy to deal with Gongzi You, and that the Huntress had a very bad impression of Golden Era, especially after their few encounters. But she also knew that patience was something that she needed to handle such a situation, and she needed to be shameless. This was why Death Blossom continued her persuasion after a few seconds of silence, “Gongzi You, can we not be enemies?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci raised an eyebrow, “Huh?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’d like to negotiate a truce with you on behalf of Golden Era.” Death Blossom sighed. She had a nudging feeling that her negotiation with Gongzi You would end in failure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A truce?” Ye Ci let out a laugh, “Golden Era wishes to have a truce with me? Don’t you think this is ridiculous? You attacked me, and my guild, and you want to have a truce with me? I don’t know what you’re thinking, but don’t you think I’m an idiot if I accept your offer just like that?” &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was not a person of many words, especially for people who she did not like.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright then,” Death Blossom sighed, she was now certain that a truce with Gongzi You was impossible, “Golden Era is willing to buy Mithril from you with a price higher than its market value.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even Ye Ci was shocked. She stared at Death Blossom with disbelief clear on her face.&nbsp;<em>How did Golden Era know about the Mithril? How did they know that we are in control of an ore vein?</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The purpose of our guild’s fort is known to only a few of our officers. Even the battle on that day was disguised as a Guild Quest. Genesis must’ve taken the same measure as well. So how did Golden Era know about the ore veins?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci realised that a long period of silence you arouse suspicions from Death Blossom. And she was able to quickly calm her nerves, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her response was already expected by Death Blossom, “Let’s be straightforward with each other, shall we? I’m sure we all know why you and Genesis are building those forts.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s gaze grew colder. She stared silently at Death Blossom, not confirming nor denying her words. “And what does it have to do with Golden Era?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Gongzi You, don’t you know what they call Golden Era?” Death Blossom was twirling her dagger around, “We might not have a good reputation, but I’m pretty sure game developers will have headaches whenever they hear our name. If even the developers of a game are helpless against us, what can a small guild like Upwards Ho! Do?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you threatening me?” Ye Ci raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why would I? I do not condone violence. Though I have to admit, it’s a very effective method.” Death Blossom smiled, “I’ve always believed in peaceful coexistence. And I hope you’d want to peacefully coexist with me.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci stared at Death Blossom, and the sweet and seductive smile that was on her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Is that not a threat?</em> Ye Ci sneered at the Rogue, “Death Blossom, I know that Golden Era will not be negotiating with me if you think you have a chance of winning. No matter how strong I am, I am still nothing but a speck of dust compared to your entire guild. I believe that you’re standing here today not because you’re afraid of me. According to your own words, fighting fire with fire is the simplest and most effective way. And I agree with you. Upwards Ho! was not afraid of you back then, and we will never be afraid of you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So you’re rejecting my offer then?” Death Blossom sighed. She knew that the negotiation would end in such a way. Gongzi You was right. Upwards Ho! was nothing but an insignificant speck of dust compared to Golden Era, but it was also a ticking time bomb standing in the way of the guild’s dominance of Fate. The bomb might be small, but it had the potential to cause an avalanche when it detonates. And this was why Death Blossom wished to talk to Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Mithril ore vein was one of her goals, but it was simply something like a bonus if they were able to destroy Upwards Ho!. They had now learned that Upwards Ho! would never go down without a fight. It was a foreseeable future, but it would not be an easy one for Golden Era.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ll wait for the day you come after Upwards Ho!.” Ye Ci smiled at Death Blossom.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And at that point, Death Blossom had already given up on negotiations, “Very well. We shall meet again in the future.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright then.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Death Blossom stared at Ye Ci, and finally spoke up after some hesitation, “I have a request.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What is it?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“When the time comes, I hope we can meet each other in combat.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“As you wish.” Ye Ci smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll be taking my leave.” Death Blossom disappeared behind a screen of smoke, and Ye Ci climbed back into the sky.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Fleeting Time arrived at the spot and saw the white smoke, “Was it a Rogue from Golden Era?” he asked with a frown on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes. It’s Death Blossom.” Ye Ci did not hide the truth. She then turned around and stared at the handsome face beside her, “Fleeting Time.”&nbsp;</p>
