 <p><strong>Chapter 216 We’re Moving (Part 1)</strong></p>
 <p>They moved into the new house without taking anything from their old.</p>
 <p>When Ye Ci discovered Zuo Xiaolan had packed their belongings, she immediately stopped her mother, “Mom, put everything back. We’re not bringing any of them with us.”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Why?” Zuo Xiaolan was confused.</p>
 <p>Bai Mo had woken up. He shook his head in disapproval when he noticed that Zuo Xiaolan had already packed their belongings, “Aunty, we can’t bring these things along with us. We don’t know about the people out there, and I think they know by now that we take a walk everyday, which means that they probably won’t follow us during this small time window. This is the best chance for us to slip away. If you take so many things with you, it’s like telling them that we’re planning to run away. Wouldn’t that invite trouble for us?”</p>
 <p>“B-but… These things cost quite a lot…” despite Ye Ci’s and Bai Mo’s words, Zuo Xiaolan was still reluctant to part with her belongings.</p>
 <p>“Mom, just bring whatever jewelry you have and your bank account book along. We’re leaving the rest here.”</p>
 <p>“We’re not even going to take a change of clothes with us?” Zuo Xiaolan caressed the luggage that she took time to pack up, and eyed her daughter carefully. She was still slightly unwilling to part with her belongings.</p>
 <p>“I mean ‘<em><strong>everything</strong></em>’, mom. Do you not know what ‘everything’ means?” Ye Ci narrowed her eyes. By the time, Ye Nantian has returned home with breakfast, “Come, breakfast is here!” said Ye Nantian as he spotted everybody else. .</p>
 <p>“Dad, help mom out and put whatever she packed back to their initial places. Remember, we have to act normal when we leave home. Bring nothing with you, and wear your usual clothes. We’re going to move out of here.” said Ye Ci as she took the packed food from her father, wheeled herself into her room, and proceeded to unplug her game card from the gaming cabin. For her, the card was the only thing that she could not afford to let go.</p>
 <p>As expected, Ye Nantian had his own way of dealing with Zuo Xiaolan. When Ye Ci finished her breakfast, Bai Mo was already helping the couple to put everything back to where it had been originally.</p>
 <p>It took them half an hour to finish up. When Ye Nantian, Zuo Xiaolan, and Bai Mo gathered to eat their breakfast, sweat was pouring down from their foreheads. Tears flowed out of Zuo Xiaolan’s eyes as she ate her breakfast in silence.</p>
 <p>“Why are you crying?” Ye Nantian sighed, “Moving to a new home is a good thing.”</p>
 <p>“I know, but we’ve been living here for so many years now. To think that I can’t bring anything along with me… It’s like losing part of myself. I’m devastated.” sobbed Zuo Xiaolan. She knew that her daughter’s words were true, but she had feelings for this house. She could see hints and traces of Ye Ci growing up in every corner of this house, and the happy days she spent with her family. However, she was forced to leave all the fond memories behind.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci could understand the feelings of her mother She sighed, and wheeled herself next to her, speaking in a soothing tone, “Mom, don’t be sad. It’s just a temporary measure. We’ll be back when everything’s over, and you can bring anything you want along. If you want to live here, we can move back here as well”</p>
 <p>Zuo Xiaolan sniffed and patted Ye Ci’s shoulder with a smile, “I know, honey. I just hate to part with this house. Don’t worry, I’ll be able to handle myself when we leave.”</p>
 <p>After finishing breakfast and making sure that Zuo Xiaolan had calmed down her emotions, the family of four left home. Zuo Xiaolan was the last to step out of the house. Her hand was trembling when she shut the door, and even inserting the key into the keyhole proved to be a challenge for her. After taking a deep breath, Zuo Xiaolan was finally able to successfully lock the door.</p>
 <p>As usual, the family greeted their neighbours warmly.</p>
 <p>As usual, the family headed for the park near their housing area with Ye Ci in a wheelchair.</p>
 <p>Once they were in the park, the family left through one of the side exits and immediately called a taxi, heading straight for their new home.</p>
 <p>The house owner handed his keys to Ye Ci at the previously agreed time, and the deal was sealed. Ye Ci immediately instructed her father to hire a locksmith to change the locks after the previous owner left. She then switched her phone off, and inserted a new SIM card.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was finally able to feel somewhat relieved when everything had been settled. Zuo Xiaolan sat on the couch, suspiciously eyeing her new surroundings. She felt like a stranger in her new home. Of course, Ye Ci understood that it would take quite some time for her mother to get used to her new environment. She did not attempt to console her mother, as she knew that it would have an adverse effect on Zuo Xiaolan. The best way was to allow her mother to slowly adapt to the situation.</p>
 <p>As Ye Ci was busy with settling down in the family’s new home, Bai Mo headed to Fate’s Customer Service Center in their city and ordered five gaming cabins. As the residents of the housing area were all new tenants, they did not know each other well. With gaming cabins being a necessity in every household, Bai Mo’s action of purchasing five gaming cabins did not arouse any suspicions from his neighbours.</p>
 <p>Zuo Xiaolan and Ye Nantian were very busy as well. Even when the furniture and electrical appliances were already provided, the house was still rather empty. The old couple headed straight for the supermarket nearby, purchasing various items ranging from their daily necessities, to clothes, shoes, food, and some home decoration.</p>
 <p>When Ye Ci and Bai Mo climbed into their gaming cabins, the couple was still busy with decorating their new home.</p>
 <p>It had been and entire month since the two of them logged into the game. Although Bai Mo entrusted the guild to Timely Rain, Let Go Of That Girl, Little Icy Cold Hands, and Pickled Pepper, during that one month, the prestige of the guild suffered a blow when its guild leader and vice leader went missing. Some of the newer members had even chose to leave the guild. Fortunately for ‘Upwards Ho!’, the loyalty of its core members remained unperturbed.</p>
 <p>The entire guild was overjoyed when Bai Mo and Ye Ci finally logged into the game.</p>
 <p>“Uwahh! I must be dreaming! Did I just see two missing people logging into the game? Is this a sign from the Gods?” shouted Fruit Jelly, was the first one to notice the presence of the duo, into the Guild Channel.</p>
 <p>Her shouts attracted the attention of the rest of the guild members. They set aside their tasks, and started a lively conversation with Ye Ci and Bai Mo. Some of them made fun of their leaders, while others made attempts at teasing the duo. Despite that, their concern for the wellbeing of Ye Ci and Bai Mo was obvious.</p>
 <p>“Hmm… How curious for the Leader and Vice Leader to disappear at the same time. Where have you been? Did you guys… Did that?”</p>
 <p>“Yup! Did you guys elope or something?”</p>
 <p>“They were gone for an entire month without prior notice! They must’ve gone for their honeymoon!”</p>
 <p>“I agree with you! I strongly agree with you!”</p>
 <p>“Gongzi, do you know that the Eastern Continent was quiet when you were gone? Do you know that you’re the greatest source of our gossip?”</p>
 <p>“Of course.” a smile lit up Ye Ci’s face, she could feel the genuine concern her friends held for her, “I’m sure the lot of you assumed that I had died when I was gone.”</p>
 <p>“Bah! How could you say something like that? I’m amazed by your ability to shoot your mouth off…”</p>
 <p>Just then, Ye Ci received a private message from Liu Chang.</p>
 <p>“I tried calling you yesterday, you got a new number.”</p>
 <p>“Yup. I changed my number yesterday.” Ye Ci told Liu Chang the truth. She was the only person outside her family who knew about the incident. She would never lie to Liu Chang.</p>
 <p>“How’s your leg?” Liu Chang sighed, “Why won’t you allow me to pay you a visit after you’re discharged?”</p>
 <p>After a moment of thought, Ye Ci decided not to tell Liu Chang about the people lurking around her house. Instead, she responded with a question of her own, “Liu Chang, have you tried contacting Dong Yin recently?”</p>
 <p>“Not at all. Well, I haven't cut ties with her like what I did with Yi Cang, so she would give me a call once in a while. She has been pestering me with calls recently,” Liu Chang was confused by Ye Ci’s sudden question, “Why are you asking such a question? Do you have some business with her?”</p>
 <p>“Nope, not at all,” Ye Ci narrowed her eyes after listening to Liu Chang’s words, “She’s been contacting you very frequently these few days?” asked Ye Ci after a slight pause.</p>
 <p>“Yup. I have no idea what she's up to. She’s been trying to have smalltalk with me, and was indirectly asking about you.”</p>
 <p>“Have you told her anything?”</p>
 <p>“Of course not! Why would I tell her anything about you? I have nothing to say to her.” Liu Chang had been disgusted with Dong Yin since their dinner that night. Although she did not sever all ties with Dong in, she no longer saw the girl as a friend.</p>
 <p>A sudden thought flashed across Liu Chang’s mind, “Ah! There’s something I have to tell you.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“She mentioned something about you that day. She told me that you’re hospitalized. I was curious! How would she know about something like this. When I tried asking about it, she panicked, and hung up on me.” Liu Chang was confused about Dong Yin’s strange behavior on that day.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Ci did not share the same sentiment. A thought immediately formed in Ye Ci’s mind the moment she heard Liu Chang’s words. She was not entirely sure, but she had a hunch that Dong Yin was the culprit behind the entire incident.</p>
 <p>“Liu Chang, it’s best if you don’t come looking for me these days.” said Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>“But why?” Liu Chang was genuinely confused. She believed that Ye Ci would be bored out of her mind due to her injury. That was why she wanted to pay her friend a visit and keep her company. <em>But why did Ye Ci keep turning me away?</em></p>
 <p>“Liu Chang, I’ll talk to you about this in the future, but it would be the best if you don’t ask about it now. If I’m truly a friend of yours, don’t come to my house, or we’ll both get into trouble.” Ye Ci continued after a short moment of thought, “also, avoid all contacts with Dong Yin and Yi Cang in game and in real life. Tell your parents about this as well.”</p>
 <p>“Little Ci, just what the hell happened?” Liu Chang felt uneasy the moment she heard Ye Ci’s words. She started pestering Ye Ci with questions in an attempt to seek for answers.</p>
 <p>“I assure you that I will not cause you any harm, and I guarantee that the truth will definitely scare you. So please… Don’t ask any questions, and don’t come looking for me.” said Ye Ci in a serious tone. She knew that Liu Chang would be able to understand the gravity of the situation.</p>
 <p>As expected, Ye Ci knew Liu Chang well. Despite her unease, Liu Chang gave up on her questioning. “Little Ci, you’ve always been like this since young. You’re always shouldering everything yourself. I know it’s for my own good, but I’m still worried for you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci could detect the hints of dejection in Liu Chang’s words. She could not help but think to herself, am I really too independent at times? Before she could utter a single response, Liu Chang spoke up, “Little Ci, you don’t have to say anything, because I know what you’re going to tell me. Just listen to me.”</p>
 <p>“Alright.”</p>
 <p>“You must’ve had your own thoughts about this, and I know that you’re suspecting Dong Yin as the culprit. I don’t want to speak to you in Dong Yin’s stead, but there’s something I really have to tell you. You don’t have to do waste your breath on people who are no longer relevant. It’s not worth it. What happened between us and Dong Yin and Yi Cang can never be fixed. Just let it go. If this continues, I’m afraid that you’ll be the one that’s hurt…”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci could feel a hint of sadness in her heart. Liu Chang was just too kind of a person. She was unable to bring herself to tell Liu Chang that this was not how she preferred to deal with things. After a moment of hesitation, Ye Ci spoke with a smile, “I won’t involve myself in any affairs regarding Dong Yin and Yi Cang, and you should stay away from them as well. I want nothing to do with them ever again.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, you don’t have to worry about that.”</p>
 <p>Despite her words, Ye Ci could not resist to urge to give Liu Chang another reminder, “Remember what I told you just now, and be careful.”</p>
