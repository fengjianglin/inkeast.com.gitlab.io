 <p><strong>Chapter 117 First Blood! Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum!</strong></p>
 <p>Ye Ci fired Rapid Fire at Ideal Height 1.7m. Her Rapid Fire was already at lvl 7, and she could fire 10 arrows in one go. Despite having some degree of damage resistance, Ideal Height 1.7m’s equipment was just too inferior when compared to Ye Ci’s. 10 arrows buried themselves into Ideal Height 1.7m’s back.</p>
 <p>Since all of the arrows hit vital areas, they dealt critical damage. Before the damage value of all 10 arrows could be shown, Ideal Height 1.7m let out a shriek- she was already dead. Since there was still time left on the DEBUFF’s timer, she did not explode. Because of that, she did not bring harm to the rest of the party members, despite being in close proximity to their position.</p>
 <p>Nobody protested against Ye Ci’s actions as they understood her reasons. All of them were paying close attention to the fight.</p>
 <p>When the BOSS only had 3% of its HP left, Pickled Pepper Phoenix Claw was also hit by the DEBUFF. Because of what happened with Ideal Height 1.7m, he knew that Ye Ci would take him out as well. He simply stood still and threw every skill he had at the BOSS, while Ye Ci fired at him after he received the DEBUFF.</p>
 <p>There were four of them left and the BOSS had 0.7% of its HP remaining. It could basically go berserk really soon. If they didn’t attack the BOSS now, they would definitely get killed. If all of them concentrated their attacks on the BOSS and were hit by the DEBUFF, they still had 3 seconds to do as much damage as they could.</p>
 <p>After a brief moment of contemplation, Ye Ci calmly gave an order, “Concentrate all of your attacks on the BOSS. He can only call one name at a time. There are 4 of us left and he only has 0.7% of his HP left.”</p>
 <p>F*ck it all! These were the thoughts left in all of the party members’ minds. They began to hit the BOSS with everything they had. Even Fruit Jelly began to attack the BOSS as she healed her party members. After all, if somebody was affected by the DEBUFF, there was no point in healing them.</p>
 <p>“Remote Depths, you dare to anger me? I will teach you a lesson!” Remote Depths was then hit by a DEBUFF and Let Go Of That Girl immediately took his position. The former was the main tank of the party while the latter was the secondary tank, their game awareness was sharp. Knowing that Let Go Of That Girl will take his position, Remote Depths immediately activated Charge, dashed to a safe place and exploded.</p>
 <p>The BOSS had 0.2% of his HP left. With her own HP rapidly dropping, Ye Ci summoned Ol’ Four, which immediately charged at the BOSS and Pow! Pow! Pow! The BOSS was hit by 3 Epic-tier skills. It then shouted, “Gongzi You, you dare to anger me? I will teach you a lesson!”</p>
 <p>A mournful screech of the BOSS followed right after, “No! Duo’ma will not fail! Duo’ma will not fail!” and the white blizzard bellowed through the place. Those who had died were resurrected, while those that were alive had their health and mana replenished. The BOSS dropped dead with a loud boom.</p>
 <p>It became deathly quiet. The players stood still, momentarily stunned. They had been revived? What does this mean?</p>
 <p>Before they could recover from their shock, Ye Ci received a system notification, “Upwards Ho! has successfully obtained First Blood for the 50-player dungeon, Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum. As the party leader, do you want to announce this result to the world?”</p>
 <p>During her previous First Bloods, Ye Ci was not the party leader. She was not given the chance to decide if she wanted to announce her name. Party leaders would of course not wish to hide the fact that they’ve gained First Blood. This was why even if Ye Ci had the mentality of ‘Humans fear getting famous like pigs fear fattening’, people would usually announce a First Blood.</p>
 <p>It was different this time. This time, she was the guild leader. She had the initiative. However, she no longer had any thoughts of remaining low profile. This time, they, Upwards Ho!, must announce it to the world!</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Right after Ye Ci made the selection, a system announcement rang out, “Congratulations to Upwards Ho! for being the first guild to clear the Normal difficulty 50-player dungeon Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum. Rewards: Guild Prestige points x1000, Global Prestige Points x15000, Gold coins x8000. Let us remember the heroes’ names.”</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Gongzi You for leading the Upwards Ho! team in achieving First Blood in the 50-players dungeon Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum (Normal Difficulty). Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige Points x300, Talent Points x5. Achievement: ‘Nightmarishly Normal! Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum First Five!’. May her name be engraved in the history of Fate.”</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Remote Depths for achieving First Blood in the 50-players dungeon Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum (Normal Difficulty). Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige Points x300, Talent Points x5. Achievement: ‘Nightmarishly Normal! Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum First Five!’. May his name be engraved in the history of Fate.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Let Go Of That Girl for achieving First Blood on the 50-players dungeon Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum (Normal Difficulty). Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige Points x300, Talent Points x5. Achievement: ‘Nightmarishly Normal! Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum First Five!’. May his name be engraved in the history of Fate.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Fruit Jelly for achieving First Blood in the 50-players dungeon Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum (Normal Difficulty). Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige Points x300, Talent Points x5. Achievement: ‘Nightmarishly Normal! Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum First Five!’. May her name be engraved in the history of Fate.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Although they had merely cleared the dungeon at Normal Difficulty, it was still the first 50-player dungeon in the Eastern Continent. The World Channel was flooded with glowing red words that were very dazzling.</p>
 <p>The World Channel erupted into chaos.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t even know that Upwards Ho! was pioneering a dungeon, yet they’ve cleared one just like that? Are they using cheats?”</p>
 <p>“If I’m not mistaken, they started yesterday.”</p>
 <p>“Yesterday? Wasn’t there a thread accusing Gongzi You of being a thief? No wonder Upwards Ho! was so quiet about it! They’re all in the dungeon.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve always thought that Upwards Ho! was mediocre, and that their members were unwanted trash from the other guilds. How did they even get First Blood? Gongzi You did help World Conqueror to obtain First Blood for Frosty Wasteland. But they’re a major guild with a lot of resources. What the hell happened this time? How the hell did a small guild like this get First Blood?”</p>
 <p>“By the way, I heard that Tang Dynasty was also exploring this dungeon today. Didn’t they say that they’ll clear it today? Why have we not heard anything from them?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The members of Upwards Ho! did not even have the energy to pay attention to the World Channel. They rushed towards Ye Ci, screaming as they went, throwing her into the air. Quite a number of players burst into tears. It was a very emotional moment. This First Blood belonged to Upwards Ho! and it was also their very first.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was filled with excitement as well. Despite clearing this dungeon countless times in her past life, this was the first time she did it for her own guild, and her own friends. It was an entirely different sensation.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Meanwhile in Tang Dynasty…</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud was the one who was leading the expedition into the dungeon. The guild leader, NightAndDay, had not shown up. He was busy leveling up, and had left the command to Wandering Cloud.</p>
 <p>Tang Dynasty’s team was far superior compared to Upwards Ho!. To them, Upwards Ho! was a rag-tag bunch of weaklings. They did not have good equipment, and their teamwork was mediocre. The elites of Tang Dynasty were veterans that had gone through countless hardships together. Their discipline and awareness were amongst the best if not the best.</p>
 <p>To clear this dungeon, they had sent their regulars into the dungeon countless times, using them to test the waters and gather intelligence about the skills of each BOSS. After a long time of careful research and study, the guild selected 50 of the best elites and sent them into the dungeon.</p>
 <p>Although they’ve been trying for three days in a row, they were confident that they will be able to achieve First Blood. They had purchased intel from information dealers regarding the progress of other guilds. With the exception of Wolf Pack, the other guilds were not any cause for alarm. Wolf Pack was the same as Tang Dynasty and had challenged the 3rd BOSS Duo’Ma a day earlier than Tang Dynasty, but their luck was bad and they had suffered heavy casualties. This meant that they needed a few days to recover before they could challenging the BOSS once more.</p>
 <p>Tang Dynasty would be able to achieve First Blood within the said few days. Despite receiving reports that Upwards Ho! had also started to exploring the dungeon, Wandering Cloud did not take it seriously. He knew that Gongzi You was very capable. However, a single player would not be able to bring that much of an impact. In his eyes, Upwards Ho!’s players were all subpar. How could they possibly clear this dungeon within two days?</p>
 <p>This was why Wandering Cloud was sure that Tang Dynasty had the First Blood in the bag.</p>
 <p>He was sure until the system announced that Upwards Ho! had achieved First Blood. Wandering Cloud was stunned, and had only recovered when the party commander shouted out loud, “Guild leader, you’ve been DEBUFFed!” He reacted just in time to cast Charge and dropped dead in a safe place. As he laid dead on the ground, Wandering Cloud felt like he was going to cough up blood. How? How could this happen? How in the world was that even remotely possible?</p>
 <p>Two minutes later, the system notification rang up again. Tang Dynasty had achieved First Five in the 50-players dungeon, Frosty Wasteland Inner Sanctum.</p>
 <p>Although it was only 2 minutes, it was still overwhelming…</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud felt a tightness in his chest. He sat down, and pounded the ground. “Upwards Ho!, I will not allow you to get First Blood so easily next time!” Wandering Cloud bellowed with rage.</p>
 <p>In contrast with Tang Dynasty’s low morale, Upwards Ho! was practically going crazy from joy. Not only did they bag the First Blood, the looter, Icy Cold Tiny Hands had extremely good luck, instantly looting several items. With the exclusion of players who had already received equipment from the first and second BOSS, the eyes of the remaining players almost popped out from their sockets.</p>
 <p>Purple Equipment, it was actually a Purple Equipment!</p>
