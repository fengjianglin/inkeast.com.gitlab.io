 <p><strong>Chapter 205 This Banquet Will Not End Well (Part 1)</strong></p>
 <p>Liu Chang heard Yi Cang as well. She cast a glance at Yi Cang, and spoke in a leveled voice, “Wow, then I would like to thank Young Master Yi for granting us the opportunity.”</p>
 <p>Such harsh words were rare from a soft hearted person such as Liu Chang. She was apparently quite angry on this day. Perhaps, it was her pent up anger resulted from their last gathering. With Yi Cang’s presence, she could no longer hold herself back.</p>
 <p>However, Liu Chang acted at a wrong timing. The expression of Dong Yin’s and Yi Cang’s family members darkened, and Liu Chang’s parents began glaring daggers at her.</p>
 <p>“How could you say something like that? Quick, apologize to Yi Cang!” Liu Chang’s mother immediately shouted at her.</p>
 <p>Liu Chang was not from a wealthy family, but she had a strict upbringing. Her parents were the strictest among the four families.</p>
 <p>With her feelings hurt by her previous encounter with Yi Cang and the anger that was currently raging within her, Liu Chang was reluctant to apologize. Besides, she did not feel that she was in the wrong -</p>
 <p>Noticing that Ye Ci was still munching on the pork trotter throughout the entire ordeal, Zuo Xiaolan slapped the chopsticks away from her daughter’s hand and glared at her, “Apologize to Uncle Dong right now! What have I taught you? Listen when the adults are speaking! Why are you still eating?”</p>
 <p>Despite her strict tone, Ye Ci knew that Zuo Xiaolan was not at all angry at her, but was disgusted by Yi Cang’s behavior. However, this did not change the fact that Ye Ci had lost face as a result.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci creased her eyebrows and lifted her head. She shifted her cold gaze towards Yi Cang. At that moment, Yi Cang was still waiting for an apology from Liu Chang with his chin held high. Ye Ci had never realised that Yi Cang could be so obnoxious. She had the urge to splash a bowl of hot soup at his annoying face.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Ci refrained from doing so, as she noticed that Liu Chang was ready to explode in a fit of rage. She grabbed hold of Liu Chang’s hand, and faced Dong Yin’s father with a fake smile, “I’m sorry, Uncle Dong. We’ve never been to such a high class restaurant before. We do not know the proper table manners. Please forgive us.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s words were like razors scraping on the faces of the parents of Yi Cang and Dong Yin. Yi Cang’s parents could only stare at their son with darkened expressions, and tried their best to salvage the situation.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t Uncle Dong have something to say?” Ye Ci smiled at Dong Yin’s father. She noticed that the originally jovial atmosphere has died down. She did not want to kill the atmosphere, as she was the one who caused the commotion in the first place. The adults were caught in an awkward position. They did not know what transpired between their children. They still had the impression that their children were still very close to each other. Unfortunately for them, things had changed.</p>
 <p>Ye Nantian was the first to react. Following his daughter’s lead, he attempted to lighten the atmosphere, “Yup, Old Dong, were you going to say something just now? So what did you want to tell us?”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang’s father immediately joined in on the effort, and the atmosphere once again became warm and lively.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci leaned back against her chair and stole a glance at Liu Chang, who had her gaze lowered, appearing deep in thought. She gave Liu Chang a nudge, drawing her attention. Ye Ci spoke with a soft voice, “Don’t make things too tense. We might not like them, but we have to think of the feelings of our parents.”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang sneered coldly and stood up. “Uncle Dong, uncles, aunties, I’m going to the toilet, please excuse me.” said Liu Chang to Dong Yin’s father who has not begun his speech yet and left the room.</p>
 <p>Everybody was stunned by Liu Chang’s sudden behavior, and Ye Ci was no exception. Liu Chang’s mother creased her eyebrows. She was about to call out to Liu Chang but decided against it. “This child…” mumbled Liu Chang’s mother after a short while, and she turned towards the father of Dong Yin, “Old Dong, I hope you don’t mind.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci could no longer hold herself back. She pushed her chair aside and stood up, “I’m going to the toilet as well.” and she followed after Liu Chang.</p>
 <p>The adults were chatting away happily and paid Ye Ci no heed. However, Yi Cang and Dong Yin were wearing tensed expressions on their faces, as if they had just lost their parents. Ye Ci did not even pay any attention to the duo. She did not expect that she would lose her cool. She could not bear to stay in the same room with the people she despised. It was as if the room was filled with a deadly virus that will kill her if she stayed any longer.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci spotted Liu Chang was leaning against a pillar upon leaving the compartment, and the latter waved at her.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci walked up to Liu Chang and laughed, “Aren’t you going to the toilet? Why are you still here?”</p>
 <p>“I’m waiting for you.” Liu Chang shrugged, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>
 <p>This triggered a laugh from Ye Ci, “How did you know I will leave the room as well?”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang slung her arm over Ye Ci’s shoulder and smiled, “Who am I? I’m Liu Chang! Why wouldn’t I know what you’re thinking about? Heh, with me gone, will you stay in that place?”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang was correct about Ye Ci. “What’s with you today? Yi Cang’s words were directed at me, and I’m not even angry, but you’ve already talked back against him.”</p>
 <p>Liu Chang snorted coldly, “That guy disgusts me. I feel that my lifespan will be shortened if I don’t talk back.”</p>
 <p>“Did something happen?” asked Ye Ci, who sensed that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>Liu Chang who appeared to be deeply troubled let out a long sigh, “I feel disgusted just by talking about it.”</p>
 <p>“Come on, stop beating around the bush.” by then, the two already entered the washroom. They had no real intention to use the toilet. After washing their hands in front of the mirror, they left.</p>
 <p>“It’s not that I don’t want to tell you, but I don’t even know where to start! It’s really pissing me off.” anger was written all over Liu Chang’s face.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“Do you still remember my grandma’s little house?”</p>
 <p>“Yup! We used to play there a lot. Didn’t it get torn down in favor of building some shop plots? Why are we talking about that?” Although Liu Chang’s grandma has passed away for years, Ye Ci could still remember the kind old lady clearly. She was someone loved by the children in her neighbourhood. She had always liked having children around, and would never scold them even if they made mistakes. She would even treat Ye Ci and Liu Chang to some snacks whenever they played at her house. Unfortunately, the kind lady was ravaged by a serious illness, and passed away even after Liu Chang’s family expended their wealth in an attempt to cure her illness.</p>
 <p>No matter how beautiful something was, it will never be able to stand against the test of time, and would crumble into dust.</p>
 <p>“Yup! That’s exactly the case!” Liu Chang snorted, appearing to be angered, “Do you know that Yi Cang’s grandma had a house in that area as well?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, I didn’t know that!” Ye Ci stared at Liu Chang, “So what does it have to do with you?”</p>
 <p>“I know, right?” Liu Chang’s gritted her teeth in anger, “Some people in this world can put two completely irrelevant things together. Don't you think that's some talent?”</p>
 <p>Even if Ye Ci was unaware of the meaning behind Liu Chang’s words, she could guess that it had something to do with the two houses. But how were those houses related? “I don’t get what you’re trying to say.”</p>
 <p>“The developers have notified us about it more than a year ago. I’ve even told you about it.”</p>
 <p>“Yup, you sure did.” Ye Ci let out an awkward smile. The event that happened 1 year ago to Liu Chang was like a distant past for Ye Ci. No matter how well her memory was, it was impossible for Ye Ci to remember such a thing.</p>
 <p>“The day Fate first launched their waiter was the day the developers had a talk with my family about my grandma’s house. They told us that we could get a good storefront and a commercial housing. My parents were overjoyed!”</p>
 <p>“Yeah. If this happened to me, I’ll happy as well. To get a storefront in that area…” Ye Ci clicked her tongue. The place was now a development zone that many would soon invest in. To own a storefront in that area would guarantee a lot of income.</p>
 <p>“What storefront?” Liu Chang’s face distorted into a mask of rage as she cut Ye Ci off mid-sentence. She looked as if she could eat a person alive.</p>
 <p>“I thought you told me that your grandma’s house is worth a storefront and a commercial housing?” Ye Ci was baffled by Liu Chang’s sudden outburst.</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t be angry if that was the case! Do you know what happened when we went to retrieve the keys one month ago?”</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“The storefront was gone! We’re left with 3 commercial housings, and 2 of them are in very bad locations!”</p>
 <p>“Huh? What the hell happened?” Ye Ci was unable to make sense out of Liu Chang’s words, “Haven’t you reached an agreement with the developers? Didn’t you sign an agreement or something?”</p>
 <p>“This is where we took a wrong approach. We signed a provisional agreement instead of a formal contract! My family would of course never agree to such arrangement, so we caused a scene in their office. One of the employees took a pity on us and told us that the storefront has always been there for us, but they were swapped away by someone else a few days before we went there.” Ye Ci could almost see fire spewing out of Liu Chang’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci could understand Liu Chang’s anger. She would react in a similar way if it happened to her family.</p>
 <p>“Have you guys thought of getting it back?”</p>
 <p>“We’ll talk about that later. What I want to say is.. Do you know who was the one who swapped away our storefront?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was momentarily stunned. But after placing the pieces of information together, she was able to make a guess, “You’re not going to tell me that it’s Yi Cang’s family are you?”</p>
 <p>“That’s exactly what I’m going to tell you!” Liu Chang anger was apparent, “His mother had a brief conversation with my mother when the developers talked about the development project. She asked my mom about the property we’re going to get, and my mom told her everything! So that was why they were able to swap away our storefront with the two of their worst housings!”</p>
 <p>“F*ck!” Ye Ci’s anger soared as well, “Are they still humans? Are they still friends of your parents? How could they do that?”</p>
 <p>“This is exactly why I’m pissed off!”</p>
 <p>“Have your family confronted them about this?”</p>
 <p>“Of course we did! They denied everything, and even warned us against making false accusations as it will sour the relationship between our families! They even tried to use the fact that they found my grandma a good hospital when she was sick to guilt-trip us into backing off.” Liu Chang’s face was flushed red with anger. She turned around and threw punches on the nearby wall, as if they were Yi Cang’s parents.</p>
 <p>“So how did it end? You’re not going to just let them off the hook are you…”</p>
 <p>“What else can we do?” Liu Chang leaned against the wall after venting her frustration, “We’re poor, and they’re rich. How can we expect to win? When Dong Yin’s parents invited us over for dinner, my parents were quite reluctant. They wouldn’t have come if not for your parents.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci narrowed her eyes. Friendship is indeed thin as paper.</p>
 <p>“Hah… Some friends they are.” Ye Ci snorted coldly, “They’re animals! Yi Cang’s mom has always been a bitch. She’s stingy and very calculative, but I’ve never expected her to pull something like this off.”</p>
 <p>“Now you know why I’m so pissed off,” Liu Chang grimaced, “Now you know why I’m so annoyed when he spoke up. I’m thoroughly disgusted by him. They really think of us as country bumpkin that they can just push around! They didn’t even blink when they bullied us.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was suddenly reminded of something, “You told me before that the families of Yi Cang and Dong Yin have invested in Steel-Blooded Battle Spear am I right?”</p>
