 <p><b>Chapter 159.2: The Calamity Caused by the Bug’s Heart</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that she had really encountered some sort of danger? She looked like she had been through a lot!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha…” Just as this question emerged in everyone’s thoughts, a burst of mad laughter came from Tang Doudou’s mouth. Everyone became very confused. Could it be that someone had beaten her silly after she headed out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Bai ah, Xiao Bai. Hurry and come over here. Come help me take a look!” Before the laughter even stopped, Tang Doudou rushed in. She looked at the people in the courtyard who were staring at her with strange expressions, then ran straight to Bai Feiyun and extended her wrist which was rather clean compared to her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun glanced at her. He didn’t listen to her and check her pulse, instead, he asked, “Where did you go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiy, let’s not worry about that for now. I’ll tell you after you help me take a look!” Tang Doudou felt very impatient. If the heart of the Black Demonic Nightcrawler could cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, then Mu Ye had hope!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, he could cure the poison even without her help, so he wouldn’t come disturb her anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This matter that was taxing in spirit and body could be resolved beautifully. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking to here, Tang Doudou became even more impatient. She itched to just ask Bai Feiyun straight out to check if the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance was gone, but she was also worried about the people currently present in the courtyard. Everyone felt bad looking at her expression which seemed to be suppressing an urgent desire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Dao said, “Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, you should just help Alliance Head Li take a look first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, Alliance Head looks quite anxious. Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> should take a look first. It would be terrible if he had been poisoned!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since everyone was persuading him, Bai Feiyun could only agree. “Come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he turned and headed towards the inner courtyard. Tang Doudou wiggled her butt and followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the courtyard, magnolia flower petals drifted over from the neighboring Bai Courtyard. The fluttering flow was exceptionally pretty. Bai Feiyun walked in front, his white garments pure, his black hair shifting slightly… Tang Doudou felt slightly dizzy as she looked. She seemed to see Bai Feiyun’s body multiplying, from one body to two, two to three…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something was off ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was something wrong with her eyes? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou blinked her eyes, yet everywhere she looked, there was a Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou blinked hard, but still saw Bai Feiyuns everywhere. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!” She fell to the ground in fear. “Xiao Bai!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing that terrified voice, Bai Feiyun hastily turned around and found that Tang Doudou was covering her eyes, seemingly in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed that something had happened!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without hesitation, Bai Feiyun strode over to help Tang Doudou to the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, the moment Tang Doudou looked up and saw him, she abruptly pushed him away, crying, “N-no! Stay away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun’s gaze turned serious. What was going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xueyi, it’s me, Xiao Bai. What’s wrong? Come over here, I’ll help you take a look, alright?” Bai Feiyun softened his tone until it was extremely gentle. At the same time, he slowly reached towards Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything seemed normal to Bai Feiyun, but what Tang Doudou saw were hands extending towards her from all around. There were even countless faces, eyes, noses, and mouths… It was extremely terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go away! Stay away!” Bai Feiyun’s hand was just about to touch Tang Doudou when she suddenly flailed her arms as if she saw something frightening and tried to keep Bai Feiyun away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally realizing that the situation was serious, Bai Feiyun lifted a needle. He planned to use this to control Tang Doudou and make her calm down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, right after the needle left his hand it was hit away by Tang Doudou’s inner strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xueyi!” The needle fell to the ground. Bai Feiyun was also pushed back several steps by the shockwave. After he regained his balance, he looked at Tang Doudou with shock. When had her inner strength become so strong?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already noticed when he checked her pulse last time that her inner strength was slowly growing. It seemed that her inner strength would increase a little every time a bit of the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance disappeared. However, this increase was not a good thing. If the dantian was compared to a container, it meant that the amount of inner strength it could contain was limited. If this limit was exceeded, the dantain would shatter and the person’s veins would rupture. If it wasn’t severe, it would cause an injury. If it was severe, it could mean death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This current situation in which her inner strength was going out of control was due to her inner strength skyrocketing and causing her to be delirious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely could not subdue Tang Doudou on his own. At the same time, he couldn’t allow too many people to find out. His gaze landed on the wall of Bai Courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leaping onto the wall, he just happened to see Yu Fenger and Jin Longbiao snuggling together and talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Golden Wind Jade Dew!” Bai Feiyun kept his attention on Tang Doudou who was inside the Alliance Head Residence courtyard. A needle had already been sent flying towards Golden Wind Jade Dew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Fenger dodged the needle and stood up with Jin Longbiao. When he saw that it was Bai Feiyun standing on the wall, he exposed a puzzled expression. “Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, what do you mean by this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something has happened to Xueyi. Come over and help me stop him!” Right after Bai Feiyun finished speaking, he saw that Tang Doudou was spinning around in place violently, before she started running outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s running. I’m going to follow him. You guys hurry and come as well!” After saying this hastily, Bai Feiyun leapt off the wall and chased after Tang Doudou who had practically become a ray of light.</span></p>
