 <p><b>Chapter 164.2: F*cking Retard</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha. You actually still have the energy to dodge after several days of starvation. Looks like we haven’t starved you enough!” Xi Qiuyi retrieved his leg. He sneered as he crouched down again. Suddenly, he reached out and clutched Tang Doudou’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dodge ah, I’d like to see where you can still dodge to!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Cough, cough</span></i><span style>. Let go of me!” Tang Doudou’s arms and legs were tied up so she couldn’t even struggle. All she could do was cough helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Qiuyi didn’t continue to tighten his grip, but he didn’t relax it either. The feeling of being stuck in limbo made Tang Doudou almost want to bite off her own tongue to end it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let you go?” Xi Qiuyi lowered his head and forced Tang Doudou to meet his eyes. “Then beg me ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Pei</span></i><span style>! If you have the guts just kill me! Otherwise, scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damned pervert! There was no way she’d beg!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At most, it was just death! She wasn’t afraid!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the type of person Tang Doudou was. She only accepted the carrot, not the stick. If you wanted to try to make her do something with force, then oh so sorry, but she doesn’t accept this type of ‘encouragement!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, she had noticed that Xi Qiuyi wasn’t planning to kill her, so she became even less cooperative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really think I don’t dare to kill you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph! Of course you dare, but you can’t!” The more pressing the situation was, the clearer Tang Doudou’s thoughts became. If he wanted to kill her, he would have already done so. There was no way he’d make such a huge effort to capture her and bring her back here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Qiuyi didn’t explode like Tang Doudou expected when his actions were seen through. Instead, he stared at Tang Doudou calmly for a long while before releasing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, I can’t kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou exhaled in relief. As long as she wasn’t dead, there was a chance to make a comeback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what exactly was the point of leaving her alive and keeping her here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, what benefits could she possibly bring Xi Qiuyi? Or was it that it would cause some sort of trouble for him if he killed her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt that the latter question was a more probable issue. There were plenty of problems that would be caused by her death, but she didn’t know of any benefits in keeping her alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The things that were unknown caused people the most fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t kill you, but I can slowly torment you until you beg for death. I’d like to see how you can manage to stay this insolent then!” After Xi Qiuyi finished speaking, he called, “Liu Yan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was the sound of hurried footsteps. In the blink of an eye, a man dressed in flexible clothing appeared. “Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring her to the interrogation room!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xi Qiuyi gave that order, he strode out of the prison and disappeared into the darkness outside. The man named Liu Yan entered, grabbed Tang Doudou’s shoulder, and started dragging her outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you bringing me? I’m not going!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just the words ‘interrogation room’ sounded intimidating, so Tang Doudou naturally refused to quietly let herself be dragged there. Who knew if she’d be able to come back in one piece after going there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou’s brain whirled. Xi Qiuyi didn’t dare to kill her, but he dared to exert criminal law on her. This proved that he was keeping her alive due to the former reason. She definitely possessed something Xi Qiuyi wanted, some sort of benefit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had planned to torture her simply to destroy her insolent attitude, just starving her for another hour would be effective enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the fact that he wanted to use the interrogation room meant that he definitely wanted to force her to tell him something. And it was something he knew she wouldn’t give up easily!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Calm down, calm down. What exactly did she have that was beneficial to Xi Qiuyi?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Alliance Head Command Tablet?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, that’s something that Elder Yu would want.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be some sort of secret?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That didn’t seem right. All the secrets she knew about were regarding Jianghu matters. There was nothing that was related to the imperial court ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wait, the imperial court?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou seemed to have realized something and she immediately shouted, “Xi Qiuyi! You just want to get info on him, right? I’ll tell you all I know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Qiuyi immediately re-appeared in her sight. Liu Yan stopped trying to drag her out and stood to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You sure are smart, to be able to guess my motive this quickly,” said Xi Qiuyi in a tone that contained other meanings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou swallowed with difficulty. Her throat was uncomfortably dry. “Haha, it’s such an obvious matter, it was easy to guess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the only relation she had to the imperial court was Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the Resplendent Prince, with wealth and influence that overwhelmed the world. Any emperor would find it difficult to sleep peacefully with this type of person around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So there was no need to even mention the ambitious little princes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu, an existence that was like a fish bone stuck in the throat of emperors, was capable of overthrowing them, and could definitely be used to exchange for an emperor’s appreciation. His aid would be greatly beneficial in the struggle for the throne. If he could also get rid of the martial arts alliance and cause all the sects on the Jianghu to become like scattered sand, never to threaten the imperial court again, that would be even better!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why everyone knew that Elder Yu and Xi Qiuyi’s collaboration were each for their own interests. They were playing with fire in hopes to win big!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Qiuyi was betting, Elder Yu was also betting, and naturally, she was betting as well. What she was betting on was whether Baili Yu would rush back to save her after hearing the news!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After going through everyone she knew and eliminating them, she felt that the only one capable of rescuing her was Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her current most important task was to stall for time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had to stall for enough time for Baili Yu to rush back from Mist City. Even just the thought of it was hard. Would Xi Qiuyi allow things to go as she wished?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clearly would not. He would definitely get rid of her before Baili Yu rushed back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing she could do was stall for every minute possible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you know that, then why don’t you try guessing what this prince wishes to know?”</span></p>
