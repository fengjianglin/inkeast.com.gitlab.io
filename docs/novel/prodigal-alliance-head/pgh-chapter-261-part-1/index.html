 <p><b>Chapter 261.1: Tang Doudou was About to Fall Apart</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she didn't know Lan Jia very well, she could tell from the time they spent together in the forest that he wasn't someone that was very talkative. At the very least, he wouldn't say something to tease like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We haven't set the time yet. However, I'm sure someone will definitely get you an invitation as soon as the date is set without my prompting." Tang Doudou was currently trying to figure out how close Baili Yu and Lan Jia's relationship was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia laughed lightly. "What if he forgets?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't think he would."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lady Doudou really trusts Brother Baili a lot."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Saint Envoy Lan Jia is joking. If I didn't trust him, why would I agree to marry him?" Tang Doudou felt that Lan Jia's relationship with Baili Yu probably wasn't very good due to these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, Lady Doudou is right. However, there's something that Lan Jia isn't sure should be said."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's brows creased slightly. "There's no harm in saying it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia laughed again. However, no hint of emotion could be made out in his mild tone. "Does Lady Doudou know that Brother Baili is actually already engaged?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou staggered and almost fell down from the iron chains. After recovering her balance, she wiped the cold sweat off her forehead. "What joke is Saint Envoy Lan Jia trying to pull!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia expressed that he felt helpless. "I'm telling the truth."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If Baili Yu was engaged, why hasn't anyone ever brought it up?" Tang Doudou was sure that Lan Jia was teasing her. At the same time, she couldn't help but feel that this was true...</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was outrageous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire world already knows about their engagement and no one has ever shown up to cause a disturbance over some previous engagement. Moreover if Baili Yu did have a previous engagement, how could Su Yi possibly agree to this marriage?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have no reason to lie to Lady Doudou. Brother Baili truly does have a previous engagement." Lan Jia was still talking nonstop. The originally pleasant sounding voice was now making Tang Doudou feel the urge to beat him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course he has an engagement. He had one with me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia smiled. "Lady Doudou is sure cute. Why don't you just marry me!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stumbled again and fell flat on the iron chains. She turned around angrily to look at the person responsible for this and saw that he wasn't even helping her up. He simply crouched down next to her and his eyes continued to sparkle with shallow light as he asked, "What does Lady Doudou think about this one's suggestion?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't like it!" Tang Doudou trembled as she got back up. She glanced in front and saw that Mu Ye seemed to have recovered and was walking forward steadily again, so she sighed in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia then said, "Brother Baili is already engaged, and that engagement was set before yours. First come, first serve. Lady Doudou, you understand, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Tang Doudou was starting to find this strange. What exactly did this Lan Jia want?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia continued to smile brightly. For a moment, Tang Doudou got the impression that she was looking at Baili Yu. "You..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What about me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're not Lan Jia!" Tang Doudou shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia curved his eyes. "What is Lady Doudou joking about? If I'm not Lan Jia, could it be that I'm Baili Yu?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words struck Tang Doudou like a bolt of lightning. She pointed at him and declared, her voice shaking a little, "You are Baili Yu!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lady Doudou, are you sure?" Lan Jia slowly lowered his head. Tang Doudou's reflection was visible in his mild eyes. "Should I let you see?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knitted her brows as she stared straight into his eyes in order to try and find a trace of Baili Yu. However, no matter how she looked, she didn't sense the usual familiarity. Could it be that she was over thinking things?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia was probably just Lan Jia...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The people in front! Are you guys going to move or not!?" Just as she was sinking into her thoughts, an angry shout came from behind Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked behind him and saw that there were a ton of black-clothed men behind them. When she looked in front, she saw that Mu Ye was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hastily tidied up her black robe and apologized to the person that was looking at her angrily, then continued walking forward while still feeling puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She soon realized that something was off!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How come the people behind her hadn't been caught in the illusions?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she looked back earlier, all of them seemed completely fine! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia was clearly behind her, but he seemed to know what exactly she was thinking. He said softly, "Those people possess distributed medicine so they naturally wouldn't fall for the demonic bugs' illusions."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was shocked. Demonic bugs?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Look below your feet," said Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't want to look down, but curiosity made her peek down. Then she almost lost her footing again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn't noticed earlier, but now that she looked, she could see that the cracks of the iron chains were filled with tiny bugs with black shells. Every single one was no bigger than a fingernail and they were packed in the seams of the irons chains. The sight of them crawling around made Tang Doudou's scalp prickle and she wanted nothing but to get to the other side as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She started walking a lot faster, but didn't loosen her grip on the hair tie in her hand. If her guess wasn't wrong, Lan Jia's hair tie was what brought her out of the illusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, these bugs were so small. How did they create such a realistic illusion?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was entertaining all sorts of thoughts, she still continued to move fast since she was afraid the bugs beneath her feet would crawl up to suck her dry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou remembered these bugs vividly and she remembered those numerous teeth beneath these bugs' shells especially well. Just the thought of it made goosebumps rise up so much they could fall off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lady Doudou, you're walking so fast. This one can barely keep up." Unexpectedly, Lan Jia started speaking again as if he wasn't willing to stay silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't this a complete joke?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. For better or for worse, Lan Jia was a Saint Envoy of the Saint Tribes. How was it possible that he couldn't keep up with her walking speed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lady Doudou, I can't walk anymore," shouted Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou would have already thrown the hair tie away if it weren't for the fact that she was worried about falling for another illusion. How did Lan Jia become so annoying?</span></p>
