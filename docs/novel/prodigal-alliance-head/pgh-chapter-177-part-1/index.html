 <p><b>Chapter 177.1: Fruit of the Sacred Tree</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye didn’t speak and simply pointed at the wooden ladder, indicating for her to climb up and see for herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ladder looked pretty sturdy so she started climbing it. When she was halfway up, Mu Ye couldn’t stop himself from reminding her, “Use qinggong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She always ended up forgetting that she knew qinggong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she gradually got near the end of the ladder, she leaped up and landed on a branch nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wah, does this still count as a tree? It’s way too magical!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stood on the enormous tree branch. The beautiful scene above her was completely different from what was below her. Rainbow-colored leaves glowed with faint radiance like the immortal trees of the legends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were all sorts of fruits hanging in between those leaves. Their colors were all very bright and as far as the eye could see, no two were identical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How magical!” She couldn’t help but sigh emotionally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye nodded. “Nan Maner said that these fruits were really good, so I picked some.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could he not bring up this subject?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her tongue was still slightly numb right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem, really? Have you eaten any?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t.” He was worried that she would be really hungry when she woke up so he immediately went down to give them to her as soon as he picked some.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was speechless. Suddenly, she saw a rainbow-colored leaf drop onto Mu Ye’s shoulder. She reached over and picked it up. “How could rainbow-colored leaves exist? It really doesn’t follow common sense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps it’s related to the soil,” said Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The soil?” Tang Doudou was a good child of the new age and knew that the things required for plants to grow were not simply soil and sunlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn’t investigate deeply into this question because the question of how this tree became like this really didn't have much to do with her. She wasn’t an explorer so she wasn’t that interested in the reason why. Hence, she just gazed at it for a while. Once she looked enough, she said goodbye to Mu Ye and returned to her room to wait for Nan Maner to bring her food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye watched until her head disappeared from view. Nan Maner had mentioned that the medicinal bath was made from these fruits, so he thought they would help her recover. Why did her facial color turn so bad when he brought them up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be because the fruits didn’t taste good?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pulled off a nearby fruit. After a moment of thought, he bit down. His cold expression instantly crumbled as a red flush crawled up his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finally understood why Tang Doudou would make such an expression when looking at the fruits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, they’ve already been stuck on this crappy tree for three months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Filtered sunlight shone through the dense leaves. Tang Doudou was bored stiff as she lay on the tree, counting the days. She then gave a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye was sitting not far from her, his expression the same as always.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, the Alliance Head and the Leader of the Demonic Sect disappeared at the same time for so long. The Jianghu has probably turned into porridge from the disorder by now, right?” Tang Doudou smacked her lips, before suddenly speaking, as she looked towards the expressionless Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye nodded. “They’ll think that I took you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then search the entire country for our tracks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, they wouldn’t find anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ll definitely think that we took each other down! Haha!” Tang Doudou started laughing. After interacting with Mu Ye for these past months, she discovered that this iceberg was actually &nbsp;only cold on the surface. At times, he was actually quite fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was seriously thanks to her careful guidance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three months ago, he only spat out one or two words at a time, but now he was already capable of carrying on random banter with her. She would even see a faint smile occasionally appear on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Mu Ye, why do you always have such a serious expression? Isn’t smiling like this great?” Tang Doudou couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye stopped smiling and glanced at her. “I don’t feel that there’s anything amusing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She still had to decipher his words though. What this meant was that previously, his life was too dull and there wasn’t a time when he was happy at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sat up and knitted her brows. “Could it be that I look really funny?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, well, whatever.” Tang Doudou lay back down again and looked at the rainbow-colored leaves above her. “I really miss Xiao Bai, I really want to go back ah…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, she missed Baili Yu the most. It’s been almost half a year since they’ve seen each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know if he was searching the country for her or if he already had a new flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soon now,” said Mu Ye suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soon now what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye’s tone was serious. His eyes were filled with worry as he looked towards Tang Doudou. “Shen Moru is almost back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he comes back then so be it. The earlier one dies, the earlier one reincarnates. If one dies sooner, one will be able to avoid the birth-control policy…” said Tang Doudou in a nonchalant manner. However, in truth, she was afraid. She didn’t know what Shen Moru would do to her when he came back. Would he lock her up and drain her blood every day, or would he drain her dry in one go?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’re rather open-minded.” Shen Moru’s voice suddenly came from above their heads. He laughed in his usual strange way. “It’d save me some effort.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sat up and looked around but didn’t see Shen Moru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is sneaking around pretending to be a ghost all you know to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru’s ‘jeje’ laughter got closer. “Little girl, don’t think you can act impudent just because I can’t kill you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the last word sounded, Shen Moru’s figure also appeared in front of her. That same instant, his withered fingers made contact with Tang Doudou’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph, if you dare then just choke me to death right now!” Tang Doudou continued to be cheeky and didn’t even look straight at Shen Moru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you want to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want to, then you had better behave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had already heard words like this countless times these past three months. She didn’t pay attention to it at all. “If you want to kill me, do it more straightforwardly. I’ve never seen a man that dawdled as much as you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it will be as you wish soon!” said Shen Moru darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then released Tang Doudou’s neck. No longer minding the two, he went down the ladder to find Grandma Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sicko!” Tang Doudou cursed at his back, then looked towards Mu Ye. “How about you do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaah!!! If this won’t do and that won’t do, will I really have to accept this fate of being a blood source?” Tang Doudou once again lay down on the tree branch. Her glistening eyes contained a secret scheme. Three months ago, she didn’t have any way to deal with Shen Moru but three months later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint smile appeared on her lips as she looked at the fruits above her.</span></p>
