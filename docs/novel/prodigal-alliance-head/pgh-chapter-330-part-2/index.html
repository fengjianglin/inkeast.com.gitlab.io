 <p><b>Chapter 330.2: Ill</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was already late in the night, the surroundings were still faintly visible. They were halfway down a mountain. There seemed to be a village below, but there were no lights at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other areas were completely silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After glancing around briefly, Baili Yu started heading down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi hastily called out to stop him. "Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, please don't be in such a rush. Just wait a little longer, they'll be here soon."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu didn't seem to hear him and just increased his speed. He soon walked far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi was troubled and anxious. Where were the people that was supposed to meet them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was worried about being too loud so he had no choice but to leave the passage and run after Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quietly called in an attempt to stop Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu didn't even bother to glance at him and continued walking forward while carrying Tang Doudou. His expression was faintly visible. He looked very tense as if there was great danger behind him that was forcing him to walk forward as fast as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi was also aware by now that things had fallen out of Gu Xun's control. If he turned back, he might lose track of Baili Yu's whereabouts, but if he didn't go back, Gu Xun wouldn't know what had happened. What should he do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Jin Yi hesitated, Baili Yu got even further away. Jin Yi glanced at Baili Yu, then decided to head back first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu and Tang Doudou were not ordinary people, so Gu Xun had already predicted that they had made other arrangements. The looks of things now seemed to support that conjecture, so he had to hurry and let Master know of this news. If he took too long, it may be too late to salvage the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he reached this conclusion, he turned back to rush towards the passage but abruptly stopped when he saw a large number of people dressed in black move into the passage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hastily hid himself in the underbrush. Who were these people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as that thought surfaced in his mind, one of the black-robed people abruptly turned around and stared in the direction he was hiding. The person then started walking in his direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi was stunned. His ability to conceal himself wasn't bad, and he was so far away as well. How had this person sensed him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi's heart started pounding nervously as that person got closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when the black robed person was so close that he was almost within reach, Jin Yi suddenly felt a tug on his back, then he was dragged backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn't resist because he already saw the person that was pulling him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li, didn't you guys already leave?" Once that figure in black faded into the distance, Jin Yi finally couldn't stop himself from quietly asking his questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't reply. Once she dragged him to where Baili Yu was, she threw him onto the ground and ran to Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My guess was right, those black-clothed people were waiting for us outside the secret passage. They're the only ones who can move so fast and accurately predict what route we were going to take."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who are they?" asked Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou gave him a simple rundown of the Seven Great Saint Tribes, then had him wait while she walked to Jin Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jin Yi, are you still able to contact the people we're supposed to meet up with?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi also heard Tang Doudou's explanation and was bewildered. What Seven Great Saint Tribes? Why hadn't he ever heard of them? He was still mulling over this information, so he was startled by this sudden question. When he came back to his senses and saw that Tang Doudou seemed annoyed, he hastily said, "I'll try right away!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you don't want to die, then hurry," urged Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi hastily took out a signal flare and prepared to fire it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou kicked it away and quietly cursed, "Do you want to die?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of anger flashed through Jin Yi's eyes. Wasn't she the one that told him to do this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw that he was angry, she laughed coldly. "You want to fire a flare? Are you worried that no one will know where you are?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she said that, her eyes turned cold. It seemed that it really wasn't possible to rely on Gu Xun's people. They couldn't stay here any longer, that black-robed person from earlier might already be coming after them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou's thoughts got to here, she reached out and sealed Jin Yi's pressure points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li, what are you doing!?" Jin Yi had been caught completely unprepared since he had been stunned by her earlier words. He had a bad premonition now that his movements had been sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou paid no attention to him as she ripped off part of his garment and stuffed it into his mouth before carrying him towards the side of the road heading downhill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mmmphff..." What exactly were she trying to do!? Jin Yi was becoming more and more uneasy, but muffled sounds were all he could make. His voice contained fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sighed softly and said in a low tone, "Actually, I didn't want to do this either. However, the situation is pressing. If I don't do this, we won't be able to escape from those people, so I'm going to have to make you suffer a bit. I don't think they would trouble an innocent person, and it's even less likely that they'd kill a person that knows important secrets, so you should be safe for the time being."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, she pushed Jin Yi down the slope.</span></p>
