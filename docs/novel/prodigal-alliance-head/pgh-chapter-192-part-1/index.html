 <p><b>Chapter 192.1: Picking Faults</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are geniuses beyond one genius, skies beyond one sky. Looks like it’s time for me to head out and broaden my horizons.” Cang Baicao gave an emotional sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You already have one foot in your grave, what horizon is there for you to broaden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao sighed again. “You wouldn’t understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Cang, how long has it been since I last saw you? How did you become so profound all of a sudden?” At this time, Feng Wu had also walked out. She had changed into a red garment that beautifully outlined her perfect curves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Cang Baicao saw Feng Wu, his face turned pale like that of a mouse seeing a cat. His hand trembled uncontrollably as he pointed at Feng Wu. “She… she… why is she here!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wu gave a cold snort. “What? I can’t come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did Cang Baicao dare to say that she couldn’t? He could only force out a couple laughs, then switch the topic. “I’ll go back in to help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he immediately slipped off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in the blink of an eye he ran back again. “It’s finished. Where are the servant girls I told you to look for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re sleeping in the kitchen, I’ll go call them!” Su Yi was also very excited to hear that the treatment was over and immediately ran to find the servant girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wu, who wasn’t clear on the situation, could only wait at the side and watch them bustle in and out. A while later, Bai Feiyun walked out, looking completely exhausted. When he saw Feng Wu who was leaning by the door, he was stunned for a moment, then immediately saluted her. “City Lord Feng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t, however, ask why she was here like Cang Baicao had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve worked hard, Feiyun. How is Xueyi right now?” The irascible Feng Wu was still quite warm towards the younger generation, especially towards elegant </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>s like Bai Feiyun. After all, who could act fierce towards this type of people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun wiped at the sweat on his forehead and was silent for a while before he said, “The situation isn’t very good. The person that did it was extremely malicious. From the start, blades with barbs caused very severe injuries, yet that person even stirred the blade. I’ve already sutured the larger injuries but there are a lot of small injuries that we can only leave for her body to heal on its own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That means the person came with the intention to kill?” Feng Wu became very curious about that murderer after hearing this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun replied with a worried expression, “This person is probably not an ordinary person since he dared to commit a violent crime within Cloud City. I wonder if City Lord has found anything from his investigations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This matter probably won’t be easy to investigate,” said Feng Wu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun understood that clearly. Who asked for Li Xueyi to have a lot of enemies and even more people that wanted her life? The only way they’d be able to find out who did it will probably be to wait until she woke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun turned back and glanced at Cang Baicao who was inside the room checking Tang Doudou’s pulse, before facing Feng Wu again and cupping his fist. “With Senior Cang there, she’ll probably be fine. Feiyun will head back to rest for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His current state was pretty bad. His warm eyes were completely bloodshot and the rims of his eyes were also red. He looked very tired and it was clear he was struggling to stay alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wu had been about to urge him to hurry and rest so she immediately supported his decision when he said this. “Hurry and return to properly rest. We’re here so it’ll definitely be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though he said he was going back to rest, he was only heading to the room next door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, right after Bai Feiyun entered the room on this side, something happened on that side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could this be!? Aren’t you a Saint Doctor? What do you mean by you don’t know!?” Su Yi’s furious voice came from inside the room. Feng Wu hastily walked in. The moment she walked in, she saw that Su Yi was lifting Cang Baicao by his collar with an expression of murderous intent on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yi! What are you doing!?” Feng Wu walked up and pulled them apart. “What is there that you can’t discuss properly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old thing actually said that Xueyi is dead! Feiyun had just said that there wasn’t much of a problem earlier! Yet in the blink of an eye she died!? What dog fart Saint Doctor! He’s just a quack!” Su Yi’s eyes were red. Ignoring Feng Wu’s attempts to stop him, he continued shouting for Cang Baicao to give an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Xueyi was dead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wu also froze upon hearing this. She glanced towards Tang Doudou who was on the bed and saw that her delicate little face was currently flushed an unhealthy red and her tightly shut eyes seemed deathly still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wu couldn’t help but knit her brows as she asked, “Old Cang, what exactly is going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao was very angry that Su Yi had called him a quack and really wanted to just fling back his sleeves and leave. However, his medical ethics wouldn’t allow him to do so. Moreover, Feng Wu’s tone was pretty polite so he suppressed his anger and said, “She had already stopped breathing by the time Su Yi had brought her over. I had used a ginseng piece to help her keep half a breath of life. With Feiyun and I here, no problems occurred during the process…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he even finished speaking, Su Yi started roaring again. “No problems!? Then how did the person end up dying!? Tell me ah? How did she die!?”</span><span style>The procedures and methods in critical care were very simple in description but extremely complicated to actually carry out. There were many things outside of predictions that could occur. Even if no mistakes occurred during the process, it didn’t absolutely guarantee that the person would recover. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Accidents couldn’t be avoided. If they could, they wouldn’t be called accidents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after being yelled at by Su Yi like this, Cang Baicao couldn’t suppress his anger anymore. He shouted right back at Su Yi, “I don’t know! Who knows how she died!? I did everything I should have! I’m a doctor, not a god!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi glowered at him and was about to yell back when Feng Wu hastily covered his mouth. “Don’t bicker anymore. Do you still want your disciple!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person’s already dead, what’s there to want!?” Su Yi pushed aside her hand angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the so-called situation of ‘the people involved are confused but the spectators see clearly.’ Su Yi was angered by the news of Li Xueyi’s death to the point he lost his rationality. He was practically about to kill Cang Baicao for this loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Feng Wu saw things very clearly. If Li Xueyi really had died, Cang Baicao, with his pride of being a Saint Doctor, definitely would have left after being yelled at by Su Yi earlier. There was definitely a reason that was keeping him here. No one would want to stay just to be beaten up and yelled at. This meant that there was definitely still a way to save Li Xueyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Feng Wu’s thoughts arrived at this point, she said, “Old Cang, don’t lower yourself to his level. Hurry up and tell us, how can we save Xueyi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing what she said, both of the men froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao thought, how did she know that he still had a way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi was stunned for quite a while before he rushed up anxiously. It was unknown what he wanted to do. Feng Wu was worried that he would do something that couldn’t be taken back and truly anger Cang Baicao to the point he refused to share the method. At that time, even if he regretted to the point his intestines turned green, it would be too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi became annoyed when Feng Wu blocked him again. He roared at her, “Let me go! Don’t force me to get violent towards you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yi! If you keep being like this, this ma’am won’t concern herself with you any longer!” Feng Wu wasn’t someone with a good temperament either. When she saw Su Yi continuously acting like this, her temper flared up as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao saw that gunpowder was rapidly igniting between the two and gave a heavy sigh. He walked to the bed and looked at Tang Doudou. “As of now, there’s only one way left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said this, Su Yi and Feng Wu simultaneously quieted down and looked towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six eyes looked towards each other. After a pause, Cang Baicao asked in a low voice, “Su Yi, can you bear to part with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was said that they didn’t understand Cang Baicao’s earlier sigh, as of now, all the people in the room knew what he meant.</span></p>
