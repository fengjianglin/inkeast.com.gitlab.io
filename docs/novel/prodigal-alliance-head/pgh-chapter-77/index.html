 <p><b>Chapter 77: Pavilion Master Xin Yue</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>I’d like to know how my blood and Alliance Head Li’s blood is different from that of ordinary people. How did it manage to get such a high approval from you, Pavilion Master?” Lou Qingyun probably felt like there was no possibility of escaping, so his tone returned to his old casual style as he smiled ingratiatingly, “This way, I’d be able to brag in hell when the time comes - that I got cut off in my prime because my blood was too high quality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>High quality?” Xin Yue laughed a little, “It is high quality blood indeed. I think you’re also curious about this, Li Xueyi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh she was quite curious, but she didn’t plan to give up resistance here. She was still thinking of ways to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>I indeed wish to know about Pavilion Master Xin Yue’s clever scheme.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She then heard Xin Yue say, “I wonder if you two still remember that antique lamp?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou immediately pricked up her ears to listen carefully when the antique lamp was brought up..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>That antique lamp is an object from the distant past, no one alive still knows its secrets and uses after it was passed down so long. A hundred years ago however, someone discovered a secret about it after studying it meticulously…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person’s name was Feng Qingge. He was a madman, crazed about analyzing all the strange things of the world. A certain opportunity allowed him to obtain this antique lamp and gather all the passed down myths in ancient texts. Thus, he started the long process of studying the lamp. Fifty years ago, he finally discovered the secret of the antique lamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that it’s a secret which could shake the entire world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xin Yue didn’t say what that secret was, but it was probably related to the Black Demonic Nightcrawlers. Why would she bring this up otherwise? As Tang Doudou made her conjectures, Xin Yue continued, “In any case, the antique lamp had an additional usage ever since that time. It had the ability to verify blood quality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>There’s one more item that works in a pair with the antique lamp. As long as that type of blood approaches the antique lamp, the other object will go through an unusual change….You guys should understand now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Understand a feather of what? It’s not easy to link things together when you’re masking everything like this, alright?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>So it’s like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn’t understand but Lou Qingyun did. He asked again, “Then how did Pavilion Master know that feeding the Black Demonic Nightcrawler with this sort of blood is better than ordinary blood? It doesn’t seem to be very connected?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>How many things in the world are connected from the start?” Xin Yue gave a cold hmph as if disdaining Lou Qingyun’s lack of knowledge. She also seemed to have ran out of patience again. After cursing softly, she spoke to Boss Qing, who was outside the hatchway, “Xiao Qing, go guard outside. I will help you take your revenge once I come out of seclusion!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When revenge was brought up, Boss Qing became visibly happy and cheerfully gave an affirmation. As she pulled down the hatchway to a close, she said, “Then, I shall congratulate Pavilion Master in advance for the success of your remarkable achievement in unifying the Jianghu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Hahaha…” Her words made Xin Yue really happy. The sound of her laughter was exceptionally loud in this spacious area, “No, </span><i><span style>ben zuo </span></i><span style>doesn’t just want to unify the Jianghu, </span><i><span style>ben zuo</span></i> <span style>will unify the country! That so-called Lord of Cloud City will kneel below my foot to beg for mercy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did she freaking go crazy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou silently remarked before looking towards Lou Qingyun. She never expected that the antique lamp could even be used this way. It was practically even more overpowered than the laboratory tests of the modern era. It sounded pretty much like the stuff of legends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looks like both her and Lou Qingyun had fallen into Xin Yue’s trap. They had first gotten Lou Qingyun to accept a bet for the sake of Rutaceae Pavilion’s signboard courtesan, Yun Yan, the bet being on how high a price he could sell the antique lamp for. In reality, this was because the antique lamp would be able to come into contact with more people on the street stall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, she just happened to run into this antique lamp and linked it with the one she had seen before she transmigrated…</span></p>
 <p><span style>So this was her bad luck for running up to the muzzle of a gun herself. She wasn’t someone that should’ve appeared in Xin Yue’s plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When her thoughts reached this point, Tang Doudou stuck up her middle finger towards the Old Heavens. Hell, could he possibly make her luck any worse!?<sup>E/C</sup></span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Xin Yue’s mood was so good was because she didn’t only just find two usable food products, one of them was even Li Xueyi, who she hated so much her teeth itched. So how could she not be happy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking of Li Xueyi, their relationship in reality wasn’t as deep as she proposed it to be. She had only heard from Xiao Qing that Li Xueyi seemed to be different now. Other than the fact his personality went through a large change, he even forgot quite a lot of things. What was even stranger was that his martial arts seemed to have disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why she tried using some words to test him earlier. As expected, he was as Xiao Qing had described. He wasn’t like the ruthless and untamed Li Xueyi from before, but more so like a little lady. As for whether his martial arts were still present, it was very easy to figure out. When Xiao Qing opened the hatchway earlier, if Li Xueyi’s martial arts were still present, he should have already rushed out rather than staying here to waste so many words.</span><span style>However, all of this didn’t matter. All she wanted was that attractive fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more she thought about it, the less Xin Yue was able to hold back the excitement in her heart. She was so close to succeeding and breaking away from this damned place. She can finally go out to feel the sunlight again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clinking sounds of iron chains transmitted over from the darkness. Tang Doudou gulped, her throat a bit dry. Is Xin Yue really a strange creature? Why would there be the sounds of iron chains otherwise?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because the hatchway had been closed, this place had once again returned to being dark. Tang Doudou couldn’t exactly tell where Xin Yue was. All she could hear was that sound getting closer and closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know where Lou Qingyun went off to either. Tang Doudou could only hear her own rapid heartbeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meow ah!<sup>E/C2</sup> Could it be she’ll really have to die here today?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a large hand grabbed her from the dark, startling her so much that she quivered, thinking it was Xin Yue next to her. She opened her mouth to scream, but that person seemed to have anticipated it and covered her mouth, “Alliance Head Li, don’t panic. It’s me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s Lou Qingyun?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How come he can move?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll let you go if you don’t make a sound.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded. Lou Qingyun let go and continued to speak in a low voice, “I have a way to get us out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seriously, it turned out the reason he was silent this whole time was because he was thinking of a way to get out? Just what idea did he come up with? Is it something reliable? However, it wasn’t a good time for her to ask right now. Lou Qingyun continued in quiet voice, “However, I will require Alliance Head Li’s cooperation. Wonder if Alliance Head Li is willing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun explained his plan to her simply. Luckily, the sound of Xin Yue’s chains were particularly loud in this empty space and covered up the sound of his voice. That was why Xin Yue didn’t discover what they were up to the entire time they were talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her surprised and chilling voice soon came from the darkness, “Surnamed Lou brat, I’ve really underestimated you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She probably only cried out surprised upon getting to where Lou Qingyun originally was and discovering that there wasn’t anyone there. Since this place was sealed however, and with the hatchway above them being the only exit, she wasn’t worried about Lou Qingyun trying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Haha, the more tormented the strong prey is, the more I like it. Only that type of fresh blood would have more liveliness. Hahaha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xin Yue stopped walking forward after she laughed, as if she was concentrating to hear where the two people were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>She probably can’t see since martial arts practitioners should be capable of confirming our position by sight and don’t need to rely on sound…” Seeing this, Lou Qingyun moved towards Tang Doudou’s ear again to speak softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the exception of Baili Yu, Tang Doudou never had such close contact with any other man, so she uncomfortably turned away without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun had to use inner strength to speak in order to prevent Xin Yue from hearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t have martial arts or inner strength, so Xin Yue would definitely notice if she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun’s plan seemed to have factored in the assumption that she knew martial arts. Since she didn’t know martial arts, would that affect the plan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When this thought occurred to Tang Doudou, her body immediately became taut. She then pulled Lou Qingyun’s arm. Too distracted to care about being discovered by Xin Yue, she said rapidly in a small voice, “Lou Qingyun, I have no martial arts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She instantly felt Lou Qingyun’s body stiffen. Before he even opened his mouth, Xin Yue laughed loudly and a strong wind swept over. She was actually dragging the iron chains with her as she flew over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fishy stench propagated. Tang Doudou had to close her eyes since she was so smothered by that scent. Luckily, Lou Qingyun reacted extremely quickly and pulled her to the ground, “Don’t talk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Tang Doudou dare talk anymore? She had already covered her mouth herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xin Yue fell to the ground like a heavy hammer, shaking the rice straw. The strong moldy smell that arose almost suffocated the two. The fall and the tumbling also intensified the injury on Lou Qingyun’s arm, causing him to groan with pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wanted to ask him how his injury was, but she was afraid of being discovered by Xin Yue, so she could only use her hand to help shield Lou Qingyun’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two only stopped rolling when they knocked into the wall. Lou Qingyun reached out and pulled her up. He spoke with a bit of blame and anger, “Why didn’t you say so earlier? Now, this will be hard to &nbsp;do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was silent. In reality, she also knew that Lou Qingyun definitely wasn’t bringing her along out of the goodness of his heart, just like the way she didn’t plan to save him. It was just that the odds of success were currently higher with two people cooperating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who asked for the only exit to be above their heads?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the fact that Tang Doudou didn’t know martial arts was left out of the plan. This caused Lou Qingyun to be exceptionally depressed. He couldn’t believe that he was actually this unlucky. Li Xueyi, who was rumored to have extraordinary martial arts skills, actually lost his martial arts at this crucial moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>That’s not right ah. Are you really Li Xueyi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How can martial arts just disappear like that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And he also hadn’t heard anything about Li Xueyi getting injured recently. The more Lou Qingyun thought about it, the more weird it seemed. As the thought that Li Xueyi might mean something along the lines of having gotten poisoned, he reached out to check Li Xueyi’s pulse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment his inner strength came into contact with Tang Doudou’s hand however, it was unexpectedly rejected. In addition, the inner strength was so strong it almost devoured him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Alliance Head Li, this isn’t the time to make jokes!” Seeing that Tang Doudou’s inner strength was still intact, and the fact that Tang Doudou had almost caused them to be crushed by Xin Yue earlier, Lou Qingyun was extremely angry. He flung away Tang Doudou’s hand and moved to stand away from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was completely speechless with the way Lou Qingyun touched and spoke to her. She had no idea what Lou Qingyun meant, but was also too scared to say anything, so she could only stay silent sullenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Xin Yue, she didn’t get angry after they escaped. On the contrary, she was really true to her word. The more lively the prey was, the happier she was. Therefore, she stopped again to identify the direction of the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou really wanted to ask Lou Qingyun what exactly happened, but Lou Qingyun was very far away this time. She felt around in front with her hands for a while but still didn’t find him, so she started blindly walking in the dark. She thought that she was walking very cautiously, but she had underestimated the ears of martial art practitioners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She heard another cold humph come from Xin Yue’s direction, then Xin Yue flew over so fast the iron chain created eye-piercing sparks as it dragged across the floor. Before Tang Doudou even had the time to react, a withered stinky hand had abruptly clutched her neck.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #339966">E/C - “Tang Doudou stuck up her middle finger towards the Old Heavens. Hell, could he possibly make her luck any worse!?” ofc, the heavens is a he :D</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #339966">E/C2 - “Meow ah!” what the actual heck? is that the sound all girls make when their life is in danger :P</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff"> C: Haha, maybe it'll catch on with the readers and we'll start a new trend!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #339966">E/C3 - “As the thought that Li Xueyi might mean something along the lines of having gotten poisoned, he reached out to check Li Xueyi’s pulse.” He thought that doudou meant to say that she got poisoned instead of getting injured?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff"> C: Nah, TDD said she didn't have martial arts. Ways you can possibly not be able to use martial arts is if you're poisoned or injured. He didn't hear about TDD getting injured so he was checking if it was poison.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #339966">E/C4 - “She felt around in front with her hands for a while but still didn’t find him,” I feel like this has to be explained in brackets, cuz this got me confused for a bit before I realized that "oh right, its dark, so she moved her hands around to see if she could possibly grab hold of him"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff"> C: Explanation guys and girls, look right above~ me too lazy~</span></p>
