 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 384.2: Big Brother Baili </strong></u> </span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did she leave?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone shared a look. Could it be that the opponent was too strong so she ran?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head went to chase that person!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a person dressed in graceful white walked into the courtyard. It was Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd reacted to him like he was a relative and enthusiastically greeted him while asking him what happened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know the details, so we had better wait for Alliance Head to come back," said Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a lot of people didn't have a lot of confidence in this. That person was so strong, would Tang Doudou even be able to make it back?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun could tell what they were thinking by the looks on their faces, but he didn't bother to explain further and just walked towards Elder Yu. After nodded towards him, he went to take a look at the corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He crouched down, then reached out and pinched one of the pink flower petals. His long eyelashes concealed his eyes from view so no one could see his expression. After staring at the petal for a long time, he placed it back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Arrange for people to guard these corpses. Don't touch them and don't lose them!" said Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some people were puzzled and asked, "Why do we need to keep an eye on the corpses?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And how long do we need to guard them? What if that murderer comes back for them?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, that murderer would always take the corpses of the people he killed, so this time was actually out of the ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun said, "It won't be for that long, just until Alliance Head comes back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only two possible ways that Tang Doudou could come back. Either she caught that person and subdued him, or that she couldn't catch him and was shaken off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So if they guarded the corpses until Tang Doudou came back, there would be no need to worry about that murderer coming back to snatch the corpses because he'd have his hands too full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone nodded. Several people stepped up to the task. After Bai Feiyun instructed them a little, he had Elder Yu arrange for everyone else to head back to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no point staying here, so everyone put away their weapons and headed back to their own rooms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun and Elder Yu shared a glance, then headed to the study together. Bai Feiyun seemed even more familiar with this courtyard than Elder Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like he was the owner while Elder Yu was the guest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The courtyard was calm again, but Tang Doudou was in unspeakable agony.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those people had probably mistakenly come to the conclusion that she had gone to chase after the murderer, but the truth was, she was running from the murderer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been driven to this desolated forest. It was so quiet that there wasn't even the chirping of birds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she couldn't stop since that murderous intent was still locked onto her. It felt like if she paused for even a moment, that person would kill her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was internally crying over this, that murderous intent suddenly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no way that he suddenly left. Something must have happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't dare to relax and continued moving forward. As she walked, she suddenly heard the splash of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, there was the sound of a young girl's cry of alarm. "Help! Someone, please help! Big Brother Baili has fallen into the lake!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Brother Baili?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's mind went blank. She couldn't understand what was happening. He had disappeared earlier in the morning, how did he end up here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And he was with a woman?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He fell into the lake? Was that even possible with his martial arts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou started moving faster because she was curious and the gleaming lake soon came into view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young girl that was screaming was on the shore and in front of her, in the water, there was someone flailing in the water frantically. His head kept bobbing in and out of the water and he seemed almost out of strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this, Tang Doudou couldn't be bothered to worry about whether or not this was Baili Yu, saving a life was more important. She flew over and landed lightly on the surface of the water as she bent over to grab that man's hand and pulled him towards the shore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing she did when she got onshore was flip him over to take a look at his face. Although he also had extraordinary looks, he wasn't Baili Yu. She sighed in relief and threw him onshore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young girl on the shore was already crying from panic. When she saw this, she immediately ran over, pushed Tang Doudou aside, and started shaking the man frantically. "Big Brother Baili, Big Brother Baili! You can't die!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big Brother Baili, if you die, what is Yu <em>er</em> supposed to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big Brother Baili!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't help but feel uncomfortable with the way the girl kept sweetly calling out Big Brother Baili. She pushed aside the young girl and said, "If you keep shaking him this way, even if he was originally fine, you'd shake him to death!"</span></p>
