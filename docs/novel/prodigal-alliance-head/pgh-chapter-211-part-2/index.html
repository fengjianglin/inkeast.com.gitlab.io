 <p><b>Chapter 211.2: Su Yi Was Angry</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin only turned to look towards his arm once her figure had disappeared completely inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did Bai Feiyun mean by what he had said earlier? Why would this wound be so itchy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his danger and sliced through the bandages, then flicked off the medicine on top of the wound. The wound beneath that was turning bluish black was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I've been poisoned?" Jun Xin's expression was strange as he glanced in the direction of Cang Baicao's residence. However, when he moved, he headed in the opposite direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, after Tang Doudou had entered the City Lord Residence, she sneakily peeked into the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no one here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that Su Yi had headed out to attend to a matter and had yet to come back?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was definitely the case. Otherwise, according to his usual behavior, at around this time he would be idling leisurely in this courtyard and whistling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the possibility that Su Yi hadn't come back yet occurred to her, the large rock pressing on her heart immediately fell. She patted her chest and voiced her decision, "Let's take advantage of this time while he's still gone to sleep!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was really worried that Su Yi would look for her and start talking about some plan or matchmaking stuff again. It was fine if he just wanted to talk about it, but he wouldn't even tell her what exactly it was about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou shook her head and turned around. A magnified face abruptly came into view. The two large glowering eyes were exceptionally frightening. "Ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned around to run outside but her clothes were grabbed. Su Yi's seething voice came from behind her. "So you've finally decided to come back?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uh, we encountered an unexpected incident on the way and were delayed a little..." Since she had been caught by Su Yi, all she could do was force a couple laughs and turn back around. "Why did you suddenly appear behind me? You almost scared me to death!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Quit acting. You already knew that I was behind you when you turned around." Su Yi ruthlessly exposed her lies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So frank, couldn't we be proper friends?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After laughing for a bit, Tang Doudou obediently admitted it. "Fine, I was wrong."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn't the proverbs put it well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being honest begot leniency, being rebellious begot strictness!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hopefully Su Yi would take into consideration her good attitude and not hold it against her too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her obedient manner just made Su Yi, who was extremely angry, feel as if he was hitting cotton, unable to exert any force. He said gloomily, "Stop acting so frivolously and come with me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said that, he turned around and headed towards the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stuck her tongue out behind his back and very unwillingly followed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after entering the study, she saw Su Yi vexedly kick away the chair in front of him before sitting down. He glanced at Tang Doudou, then demanded, "Who was the person you ran after?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was currently thinking about how he had kicked the chair. She knew that he was definitely in a horrible mood and so was currently trying to figure out how to put things in a way that wouldn't make her situation worse. Hence, she didn't pay much attention to his tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"On, it was a pretty strange person. I've seen him once before in Mist City." Tang Doudou hadn't even brought up the matter of the child lamp and gave a simple answer. Unexpectedly, right after she spoke she heard an enormous 'bang.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was dumbstruck as she looked at the shattered ink stone that Su Yi had thrown to the ground. For a moment she was completely confused and didn't know what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What had she done? She didn't do anything ah?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, she became angry as well. What did Su Yi mean by this!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was you that wouldn't tell me anything yet still wanted me to cooperate with you! Now that I've cooperated and an unexpected accident messed up your plan, you're taking your anger out on me!? I'm telling you! This Sis! Won't accompany! Any! Longer! Goodbye!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was seriously too infuriating. From the start this incident wasn't her fault, yet she had stayed outside so long due to a guilty conscience before she could bring herself to come back. Earlier, she had also been trying to act more well-behaved so that he wouldn't be too angry, but unexpectedly...</span></p>
