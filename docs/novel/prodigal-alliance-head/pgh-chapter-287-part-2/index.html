 <p><b>Chapter 287.2: You're Still Alive</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia laughed again when he saw the expression on her face. He walked out from the darkness and stood in front of that lifting doorway. "My good daughter-in-law, don't worry. Once this father obtains that object, this father will definitely leave you an intact corpse!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said this, Tang Doudou discovered that she was no longer able to move. She couldn't even open her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Behave and guard the door. In a bit, I'll let you see a miracle! You'll feel such honor!" Lan Jia laughed madly as he walked inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room in front was completely black. She didn't know what it contained to make Lan Jia so excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And, how did he know that she would come here? Or had he been waiting here the entire time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coincidence? It was definitely not a coincidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only explanation would be that he had arranged all of this from the start!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had sent Shen Moru to look for something, then pretended to storm off after being angered by Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He must have already predicted that Baili Yu would bring her to Calm Note Palace once he left, so he purposefully left a clear mark beneath that table so that they would easily notice the passage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The following matters were even easier to explain. That huge bug was probably under his control and had purposefully chased her in this direction. However, how did he know that her thumb ring could open this stone door?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he knew earlier, he could have just directly stolen the ring! Why waste so much unnecessary energy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if things weren't as she had guessed, then what was the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, the pitch-black room was suddenly lit up with eye-piercing light from a flame. It seemed like Lan Jia was the one that lit it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right afterwards, Lan Jia started bellowing, "No! How is this possible!? How can it all be fake!? That's not possible!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sounds of things being smashed soon followed. Tang Doudou's heart pounded from fear. She had no idea what he saw but she shrank back in fear. With how crazy Lan Jia was acting, what if he rushed out and killed her with a smack?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's all fake! Fake!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hahaha!!!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I had searched all this time in vain! After causing so many people to die, your answer is that it's all fake... haha..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was scared, but she was also curious what exactly he was talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No! I won't believe it!" Lan Jia's voice echoed in the stone room. He abruptly rushed out. His contorted handsome face suddenly appeared in front of Tang Doudou and she almost fell back from shock. It was only then that she realized she could speak again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"L-lan Jia... you..." Before she even finished speaking, she had been dragged into the room by Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren't a lot of things behind the stone door, but there were murals all over the walls. The bamboo scrolls that were originally arranged neatly on the bookshelves had been swept onto the floor by Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a lot of broken pottery on the ground as well, and there were strange bugs squirming near the broken pieces. The sight made people nauseous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the center of the stone room was an enormous cauldron. Lan Jia pulled Tang Douodu directly towards the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a cold laugh, he said, "I refuse to believe that everything was fake. You've already been dead for so many years, yet you're still tormenting me! You're definitely saying it's fake because you hate me! But I won't believe it! I won't believe your words! You're lying to me! Lying!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>People whose emotions went out of control were very scary. Tang Doudou had seen on TV the way people with mental disorders acted when they went crazy. Lan Jia's current behavior didn’t differ much from those people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn't dare to speak in fear that if she accidentally provoked Lan Jia, he would attack her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Humph, you won't let me try, but I will try! If you have the ability, just crawl out from the underworld to stop me!" Lan Jia's voice was very sinister. Tang Doudou couldn't tell what he was planning to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she soon found out, because Lan Jia took out a dagger and slashed it lightly across her wrist. Bright red blood immediately poured out like a spring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia's eyes lit up with a terrible glow when he saw her blood. He dragged her towards the cauldron and started painting it with her blood. His glass-like eyes were now so dark and cold, it was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't move so she couldn't stop him from using her blood to paint the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As her blood flow gradually slowed, her brain started to feel heavily and her vision started becoming blurry. However, Lan Jia seemed to feel that there wasn't enough as he cut another wound and placed her on the cauldron so that her blood slowly flowed along the sunken ravines of the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed to see something flickering on the cauldron, but because she had lost too much blood, she couldn't see it clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she thought she was going to die from blood loss, she discovered that there was someone standing behind Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an old lady with a stooped back. After she showed up, she sighed and said, "Ah Lan, why go to such lengths?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as that person spoke, Tang Doudou saw Lan Jia's body turn rigid as his eyes filled with emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shuyin, Shuyin, I knew you were still alive!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he turned around and saw that it was an old woman behind him, his face immediately turned as pale as snow. "Shu... shuyin, why have you become like this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was already very weak, but she was still conscious enough to be surprised. This old lady was Shuyin? Baili Yu's mother? Her mother-in-law?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Cough cough</span></i><span style>..." The old lady was walking with great difficulty towards the cauldron and was coughing violently. "Even... like this, even after I've become like this, you can still recognize me..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No matter what you become, I'd still recognize you! Shuyin!" Lan Jia seemed very stirred up and he looked as if he wanted to hug Shuyin, but he also looked afraid and hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Back then, when you fell down the cliff, I hadn't been able to find you below the cliff, so I knew you were definitely still alive. However, I never thought that you were actually so good at hiding, to be able to hide for an entire twenty-seven years!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin laughed softly. "I wasn't hiding. I've always been on Cerulean Mountain. I never left."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia was stunned. "How is that possible?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin reached out and slowly stroked the large cauldron with her trembling aged hand melancholically. "Ah Lan, let's stop. Don't insist on continuing anymore."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she brought up this matter, Lan Jia's face became contorted again. "No! I can't give up! Shuyin, don't worry, once I find the cultivation method, I'll definitely help you restore your youth and beauty!"</span></p>
