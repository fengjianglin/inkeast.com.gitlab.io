 <p><b>Chapter 255.2: Little Gray</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>They encountered quite a number of black-clothed men along the way, but Mu Ye chose to avoid them rather than kill them. He would have them hide until those people passed by before continuing on their way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can't kill them, it'll attract attention." explained Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou understood the logic. At the same time, she was stunned. She hadn't expected for the Seven Great Saint Tribes' security to be this strong. From the looks of it, there were probably many black-clothed men patrolling the forbidden grounds where she and Baili Yu were walking last night. It was just that Baili Yu had skillfully avoided all of them, which made it seem like they didn't encounter anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also fortunate that she later encountered Lan Jia. Otherwise she'd probably be ascending to Heaven by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jia appeared in her thoughts, she wanted to ask about him again. She could tell from Mu Ye's words that he was very familiar with the Seven Great Saint Tribes. Su Yi had already told her before that people that were familiar with the Saint Tribes were definitely involved with them in some way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So in the end, was Mu Ye a descendant of the Saint Tribes or a guardian?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"About Lan Jia..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Was he the one that led you out of the forbidden grounds?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right!" Tang Doudou nodded. "Why would he be so nice as to lead me out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He has a very good relationship with Baili Yu," said Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou slapped her head. She was really dumb. Although Baili Yu disappeared suddenly, there was no way he would leave her in a dangerous situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, could it be that he also knew that Mu Ye was here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She originally wanted to ask where Baili Yu was again, but gave up when she recalled that Mu Ye had ignored her earlier when she brought up Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she continued following Mu Ye while carrying the fruits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking for a long time, till her legs felt like they were about to fall off, Mu Ye finally said to take a break.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this manner, they walked with minimal breaks for an entire day and finally got away from that Ghost Village, then plunged into the dense mountain again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the entire way, Mu Ye didn't eat or drink anything, and Tang Doudou could only use the wild fruits to fill her stomach. Although these fruits were tasty, how could fruit compare to meat? Traveling required a lot of energy and these fruits simply didn't provide enough. Soon, Tang Doudou's legs were starting to feel weak and it got increasingly difficult for her to lift her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"M-mu Ye! I can't go on anymore, I need a break!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou leaned against a tree and stopped moving. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye came back and crouched down in front of her. "Get on."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"T-that's not a good idea." Tang Doudou pressed a hand on her forehead. In reality, she just wanted to eat something else. Even a small amount of dry rations would be good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye said, "This place isn't safe. Endure for a little while. We can rest as soon as we get a bit further."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He paused. "I've already carried you before."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had an awkward expression on her face. If it weren't for what had happened with Qing Moran, she definitely would have jumped on without hesitation. However, ever since that incident she's had a strange feeling towards Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she still didn't get on, Mu Ye asked, "Are you worried that Baili Yu would get jealous?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily shook her head. Even if Baili Yu were to get jealous, he'd have to see it to be jealous. He wasn't even here, so why would she be worried about him getting jealous?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, that's not what I meant."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get on."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou tried walking again but she still couldn't move. She could only give in and get on his back. "Mu Ye, I..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's no need."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye wasn't wrong. After about another hour, a forest appeared. They walked into the forest for a while and arrived at a concealed mountain cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Rest." Mu Ye set her down so that she could sit. "I'm going out for a bit. Don't make any noise."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou replied 'en.' He then turned and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou guessed that he had gone off to get some food. Since this mountain cave seemed to be pretty far from any roads, she felt like it wasn't likely for anyone to wander in. Thus she decided to just lean against the rock wall and sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, not long after she closed her eyes, there was a familiar rustling sound. She got up and saw that the little monkey had appeared at the cave entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lil' Gray?" called Tang Doudou. The small monkey immediately jumped up and cupped its hands to salute her enthusiastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was a bit surprised by the monkey's passion. She and the monkey didn't seem to be that familiar?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did you come?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil' Gray scratched his head, then started bowing towards her again. He then rolled around on the floor making weird gestures as if he was trying to convey something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Tang Doudou couldn't understand it at all and could only ask helplessly, "Lil' Gray, what exactly are you trying to say?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's saying that someone's chasing after us." Right at this moment, Mu Ye walked in. "We can't rest here anymore."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil' Gray became even more excited when he saw Mu Ye and rushed straight towards him. He quickly climbed onto Mu Ye's shoulder and rubbed against his face. Tang Doudou didn't know that Mu Ye knew Lil' Gray so she silently remarked 'crap' upon seeing this scene. For better or for worse, Mu Ye was the Leader of the Demonic Sect. After being offended by a monkey like this, he'll definitely smack Lil' Gray to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mu Ye, this is Lil' Gray. Don't..." Unexpectedly, before she could even finish her words, she saw Mu Ye smile towards the little monkey with a gentle expression in his eyes. He thenpatted the little monkey and moved it to his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked towards Tang Doudou and asked, "Lil' Gray? That's the name you came up for it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mm. I encountered it earlier in Cerulean Mountain's forbidden grounds and just started calling i this way."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye lowered his head, then handed Lil' Gray to her. His ice-blue eyes still contained a bit of the gentle smile from earlier. "I'll give him to you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hah?" Tang Doudou was too surprised to react for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye threw Lil' Gray into her arms and Lil' Gray nimbly climbed onto her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lil' Gray, what a pleasant name." After he said that, he crouched down again. "Someone followed Lil' Gray over so let's hurry and leave."</span></p>
