 <p><b>Chapter 23: Bringing a Gift</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Qiuyue scratched the back of his head, puzzled with Tang Doudou's behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to speak again, Tang Doudou had at some unknown time already stood up and was currently looking at that palanquin, her eyes emitting a wolf-like light. It alarmed Xi Qiuyue to the point he felt a shiver. He quickly grabbed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, you better not do anything impulsive!" Xi Qiuyue advised.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past he also thought of looting this palanquin, but afterwards, afterwards there was no afterwards...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Tang Doudou didn't react, he could only ask again: "Do you know whose palanquin that is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bringing this up, for better or for worse, Tang Doudou reacted. She tilted her head and asked: "Whose is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes didn't move the slightest bit away from that palanquin. She was thinking, if she could just randomly break off a piece then she probably won't have to worry about eating and drinking this entire lifetime, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, if I tell you it'll scare the wits out of you!" Xi Qiuyue glanced around before leaning close to Tang Doudou's ear to whisper: "Baili Yu*."</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">百里煜 - Bai(hundred) Li(inside/ancient measure of length approximately 500 meters) Yu(brilliant/glorious)</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu? Which cultivation path's immortal is he?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou gaped then closed her mouth. Doesn't matter which cultivation path's immortal he is, just based on this palanquin alone. Very nice, Baili Yu, you've already succeeded in attracting this Alliance Head's attention!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two rows of young girls that were carrying Baili Yu soon landed on the ground with incomparable grace. They slightly curtsied towards everyone in the hall and spoke simultaneously: "Congratulations to Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> for ascending to the Alliance Head's position!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>They came to congratulate? Tang Doudou's eyes lit up. Then, wouldn't this mean there will be gifts to receive?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>A master with this much money, the gift he gives will definitely not lack in any way!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn't think being an Alliance Head could even have benefits like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou patted away the hand Xi Qiuyue put on her shoulder and patted off the dust on her robe. She was just about to walk up to respond when her sleeve was grabbed by someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't go over there." A deep genial and familiar voice sounded. Tang Doudou turned around and saw Bai Feiyun had come to stand behind her at some unknown time. A helpless expression flashed past his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don't tell her that it was another one of Elder Yu's conspiracies? Thinking of this, Tang Doudou looked towards Elder Yu, but unexpectedly discovered that Elder Yu seemed as if he was facing a huge enemy, his expression was completely tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeming to feel her gaze, Elder Yu turned his head to look over and also shook his head towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It's really surprisingly strange!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>How come everyone beside the one that was just talking to her looked like they just ate a dead kid?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That's right, the one that was just talking to her... She suddenly turned around and almost knocked into Xi Qiuyue. Immediately following that, she saw a face filled with dust Xi Qiuyue grin at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The snow-white shining teeth scared her to the point she shuddered. She immediately increased the distance between her and Xi Qiuyue and went to stand with Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you running for. Just now I fainted on purpose. Otherwise, you think with your bit of strength you'd actually be able to strike </span><i><span style>ben wang </span></i><span style>unconscious?" Xi Qiuyue delightedly grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This dear friend's interests are really... exotic!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But looking at the fact that it was he that helped her out first, then later he also helped explain to her the newcomer's identity, she'll let him off!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again moving over, she asked: "Baili Yu is seriously rich?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The world's richest man!" Xi Qiuyue replied assuredly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it's like this, then in the end should she go over, or not go over?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that it's been a while yet this side still wasn't responding, that maid who was playing the flute stepped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In order to congratulate Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> for ascending to the position of Alliance Head, Pavilion Master has specially prepared a gift for Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>. Hope Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>will kindly accept." Although she was a maid, the way she spoke was calm and neither servile nor overbearing. Just based on this attitude, even an unmarried daughter of a noble house would not be able to compete!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Adding on the faintly discernible exquisite features behind the hazy gauze veil, it was seriously of splendid and magnificent houses. As if an immortal fairy descended to the mundane world, causing people to be unable to tear their eyes away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don't even mention saying any words of rejection.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the exquisite small box in her hand, Tang Doudou couldn't help but start guessing at it. What in the world is inside that?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Night Pearls? Too common!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Diamonds? Hmm, this era doesn't have that!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Banknotes? Too straightforward, doesn't go in line with his status!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>.......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, what could it be? That heart of Tang Doudou's was itching ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>?" Seeing that she still hadn't moved, that woman's cherry lips delicately parted and called once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh?" Tang Doudou saw the blame in the beauty's eyes and her heart panicked. Without thinking she opened her mouth and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman slowly walked over, the fragrance from her body drifted over on the wind along with her body. In a moment she had already arrived in front of Tang Doudou: "My family's Pavilion Master has said, no matter what, Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>must put this away carefully! You must remember not to lose it again!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she pulled Tang Doudou's hand and placed that box on it, then helped her wrap her fingers around it before leisurely walking back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fishy, something's fishy!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou lowered her eyes and looked at the box in her hand. What did those words mean?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But before she could think much more about it, from that side the melody of the flute sounded again. The four maids lifted up the palanquin, petals fluttered without wind. From the looks of it, it seemed like they were actually about to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shoot, can't let them leave just like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pushed aside Bai Feiyun's hand and ran over, waving the box in her hand as she shouted: "Hey! Person over there, you, wait!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>From a look it could be seen that this guy was not on good terms with them and yet for some unfathomable reason he's gifting her a box. Now he actually wants to pat off his butt and just leave, leaving behind a pile of trouble that she'll certainly have to end up dealing with!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doudou will never allow this kind of thing to happen!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl blowing the flute glanced back and asked with a smile: "What other instructions does Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>have?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I ..." Tang Doudou's brain blanked out for a moment. Seeing the box in her hand, she immediately said: "You should take this back!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end she even added an addition sentence: "Thank your family's master for me! Just say that I appreciate his kind intentions, however we are still not familiar with each other. To give such a heavy gift, I really cannot accept it..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maid did not speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palanquin stopped in the open space outside the hall. The petals swept up without wind seemed to also stand still. The bright white moonlight as if washing the palanquin spilled coolly onto the top of the palanquin, emitting a faint light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haaa<span style="color: #99ccff;">(sigh)</span>, something that has been gifted out, how can it be taken back?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Tang Doudou thought that the maid suddenly went mute a languid magnetic voice drifted out along with the slightly cool night breeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not waiting for her to reflect on the aftertaste of this voice, that person spoke again: "If Alliance Head Li seriously does not want it, just throw it away."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>His tone was exceedingly light, as if he hadn't quite woken up and it still carried a bit of haziness. It brushed people's hearts like a feather, causing people's hearts to itch, wishing they could squeeze into that palanquin to take a look and see what type of beauty was in there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mm, that's right. Tang Doudou was positive that the person inside the palanquin was a remarkably beautiful man!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise he must be ugly to the point of explosion, to cover up so tightly...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Throwing it away is rather too much of a pity, besides, it was so carefully prepared."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Knowing that it was carefully prepared, why don't you want it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's not that I don't want it!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Because..." Tang Doudou's tongue flopped around in her mouth for half the day, not knowing what would be good to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Because you don't dare, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last words were provoking, its meanings deep.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Tang Doudou was also very depressed. It was indeed true that she didn't dare to take this, she doesn't have that ability ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Tang Doudou did not say a word, Baili Yu lightly laughed: "Haaa, looks like this gift cannot be sent out today."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He changed the subject: "Has Alliance Head Li truly made up his mind?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was eager for him to take back this gift and hastily nodded: "I've thought it over, made up my mind!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Ben zuo</span></i><span style> feels that Alliance Head Li should take a good look at what's inside first. Making a decision after isn't too late."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smacked her lips, replying firmly: "No need!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take a look!" Baili Yu persuaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not looking!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you not curious?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Curious ah! Practically dying of curiosity!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's complexion was odd. In regards to what was inside the box, she was comparably more curious as to what exactly this Baili Yu wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since Alliance Head Li is curious, why not take a look? This thing is actually fairly important to Alliance Head Li. This one* has already used quite a bit of effort in order to obtain it. After Alliance Head Li has taken a look, if you still do not want to accept it then there is no other choice but to have someone throw it away. This one cannot afford to take this item."</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Humble way of referring to oneself. 在下 translates literally to “beneath this” so like “this one beneath (you)”.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>He repeated incited Tang Doudou, causing everyone to direct their gazes simultaneously towards the box in Tang Doudou's hand. What in the world is in it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the clear color of the moonlight, the exquisite box and that palanquin were made of the same sort of material and in Tang Doudou's hand it almost overflowed with misty white light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>What plaything is this? To be fitted so beautifully.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, her watery pupils slightly restrained. She clearly knew that the Baili Yu in front of her had an ulterior motive and the hidden intent was obvious. Yet she still felt perfectly willing to fall into this trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Curiosity killed the cat, it's probably used to talk about people like Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"After I look can I refuse it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take a look then talk."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This fox is way to cunning! Although she still hasn't seen the person, from the few exchanges of dialogue Tang Doudou already had gotten to know them through experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes fell again onto the box. Should she look or not?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subconsciously she looked towards Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Look!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun's lips slightly opened and closed. Looking at the shape of those lips, he actually wanted her to open and look!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou became perturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Xiao Bai<span style="color: #99ccff;">(pretty boy)</span> bro, he's already scammed her several times......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forget it, look then let's just look!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>When has she, Tang Doudou, ever been so timid? It's all because of this group of scheming prostitutes, causing her to feel as if there was an enemy soldier hidden behind each tree and bush. Causing people to analyze everything in order to not be careless and lose this small life!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze shifted to the box in her hands again. Earlier, she didn't look at it carefully. Now that she looked at it, that big sapphire on the top of the box was blindingly bright.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Putting her hand on the box, with a slight application of force she heard a faint click and the box opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>What could be inside?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone's eyes were concentrated on Tang Doudou's hand, causing her to be under great Chinese white pear* ah!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Here's a pic:</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 204, 255)">This is really cute. "under great Chinese white pear" is a humorous version of "under great pressure" because "great pressure" and "Chinese white pear" sounds the same. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>No! Tang Doudou hesitated again, her hand pressed down. What if inside was something that was disadvantageous to her and was seen by others? What will she do then?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately she turned her back towards everyone and opened the box rapid as the speed of light and glanced inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>WTF! What toy is this!?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was very disappointed. Such a valuable box but all it contained was something like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Causing so many people to get involved, is this boring or what?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the thing in the box, Tang Doudou's interests completely faded as she weakly closed the box.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li is dissatisfied?" Baili Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course she's not satisfied! You're so rich, how could you send such a poverty-stricken thing? Poverty-shaken is enough, but he just had to incite her to accept it after looking. Isn't this making her seem narrow-minded?</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">B/c if she doesn't accept, it'll seem like she's looking down on the gift since it's doesn't seem to be worth much.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Now she has already looked at the thing, to accept it or not is a question again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hm? Alliance Head Li?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahem, satisfied! How could I not be satisfied?!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's good if you're satisfied." Baili Yu's voice suddenly became spirited. Tossing away the languidness it became exceptionally clear and cold: "Since Alliance Head LI is satisfied with it, then put it away properly and don't lose it again! It's also not early in the day anymore, this one will not disturb everyone any longer as you discuss major events. This one will take his leave now."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That's not right, not right! Tang Doudou tapped her chin. Baili Yu and that maid constantly brought up the two words 'don't lose', it was definitely not a coincidence!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be this is something she lost? She just got off the boat*, what could she lose........</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Figurative language for she just came to this place.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A divine light flashed through the sea in her mind, the Alliance Head Command Tablet!</span></p>
