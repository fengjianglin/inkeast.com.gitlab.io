 <p><b>Chapter 151.1: Elder Yu has Returned</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was working on organizing the letters when he looked up and discovered that Tang Doudou’s face was flushed. Her ears were glowing red, as if they had been steamed. Worried that she was sick, he reached out and placed his hand on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou quivered when his cool hand touched her burning hot face and hastily dodged it. “I’m fine, my head just feels a bit heavy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me see your hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Knowing that Bai Feiyun was going to check her pulse, Tang Doudou immediately extended her hand. She kept an eye on Bai Feiyun’s expression as she said, “It’s probably fine. I’m probably just tired from running around too much these past few days. I’ll probably recover once I rest a little.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Bai Feiyun glanced at her mildly. “Reap what one has sown.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. If she was given the chance to make the same choice again, there was no way she’d run to Mist City, that damned place. If it hadn’t been for her good luck, she would have been sold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t drink any alcohol earlier, right?” His slender fingers gently took ahold of that slim wrist before pressing down slightly. Bai Feiyun’s gaze then deepened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou shook her head. If she had drunk anything earlier, she would be snoring away on the bed right now, not here talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun didn’t continue speaking after obtaining a negative answer and focused on observing her pulse. However, Tang Doudou felt extremely nervous seeing that his brows were slightly knitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Bai, is the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance flaring up again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun shook his head, helplessness flashing through his eyes. “I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t wait for Tang Doudou to ask more questions and continued explaining, “The poison in your body is becoming increasingly complex. It’s already beyond my current level of medical expertise and abilities to diagnose whether the poison is flaring up or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Tang Doudou broke out in cold sweat. If it was becoming increasingly complex, didn’t that mean that she was about to die? If even Xiao Bai couldn’t diagnose it, would Baili Yu’s method of curing the poison still be effective?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to worry. Though the poison is becoming increasingly complex, it’s also becoming very stable. If this development continues, it’s likely that the poison will disappear on its own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou found his words unbelievable. “What? Poison can even disappear on its own?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From the start Disseminating Tassel Fragrance is substantially different from normal poison. If that wasn’t the case it wouldn’t have stumped so many people. The poison had actually first appeared during the previous dynasty. The person who had been poisoned was Princess Yuyang<span style="color: #3366ff;">(Jade Sun, likely a name/title bestowed on the princess by the Emperor)</span>, the princess that the previous dynasty Virtuous Emperor Xuan<span style="color: #3366ff;">(virtuous is a posthumous title)</span> heavily doted on. For the sake of curing his daughter’s poison, Virtuous Emperor Xuan called all the godly doctors into the palace to diagnose and treat the poison and put up a huge sum of money as a reward for the antidote. However, it was of no use. In the end, when Princess Yuyan was fifteen, the poison flared up and she ended up dying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was related to the previous dynasty again. Tang Doudou rubbed her chin as she deliberated, and discovered that her face wasn’t that hot anymore, so she asked, “Then what was going on earlier? Why did my head feel foggy and my face become so hot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might have been because this room is too confined and you’re not used to it. You should be fine after walking around outside for a bit.” After Bai Feiyun finished speaking, he went back to organizing that pile of letters. These were urgent help requests from the sects that were being persecuted by the Demonic Sect. He needed to check which sects urgently needed help, then send people over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren’t a lot of sects that relied on help from the Alliance Head Residence. Other than the few large sects in the Jianghu, the other small sects had pretty much all promised allegiance to the Demonic Sect after the threats and promises from the Demonic Sect. In addition, the large sects weren’t worried about the Demonic Sect’s attacks at all so the ones that didn’t like having Tang Doudou as the Alliance Head almost never came to the Alliance Head Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, there was Xiao Yiyun who followed behind Elder Yu’s butt year round. This time she didn’t see him in the Alliance Head Residence, so he was probably with Elder Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Bai, didn’t you say that you had something to talk to me about?” Tang Doudou stood for a while, then felt that it was awkward to just be standing there watching so she walked over to help. However, she had just flipped through a few pages before her eyes rolled back. F*ck, how did she forget that she didn’t know how to read? So she could only weakly put the letters back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier Bai Feiyun had said that he had something to tell her, but in the end when they got to the Alliance Head Residence, he started working on organizing the letters on his own. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s not much actually. I just wanted to tell you to hurry and send Yuner away before Elder Yu comes back. After you left, Elder Yu somehow became very close to the Second Prince. Leaving Yuner here will be very dangerous and you’ll be implicated as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second Prince? Who is he? How did Elder Yu get involved with someone from the imperial court? No wonder a lot of people had strange expressions when I brought him up. Could it be that Elder Yu doesn’t want to be the Alliance Head anymore?” asked Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xi Qiuyi is Xi Qiulin’s son, the second prince of the Wind Spirit Imperial Household. His influence is second only to that of the current crown prince. He’s extremely shrewd and many of the princes fear him greatly, the crown prince is not an exception either.” Bai Feiyun lifted his head. A trace of a smile seemed to flashed through his eyes as if he had thought of something amusing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally Elder Yu wants to be the Alliance Head. However, he also understands that as long as the City Lord is alive, he’ll never be the Alliance Head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was still puzzled. “What does Su Yi have to do with him colluding with the prince?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun laughed lightly. His voice contained a hint of a sneer as he said, “The existence of Cloud City chokes the Imperial Household, their influence seems to be on equal grounds. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They want to unite to defeat Cloud City?” exclaimed Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Due to this matter, the City Lord has already returned to Cloud City. The Spring Offering Ceremony is almost here. Once this matter with the Demonic Sect is dealt with, let’s go back together,” said Bai Feiyun mildly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder Su Yi’s facial color was so bad that day in Gu Residence. So it turned out that he had found out that people of the Imperial Household and Jianghu were teaming up to attack Cloud City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cloud City isn’t a young existence, it probably isn’t something that can be threatened that easily, right?” Otherwise those Imperial Courts would have already taken control of it, how could it possibly have lasted until now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun sighed and said, “Ever since that incident ten years ago, Cloud City hasn’t been as strong as before. All that can be relied on to get past this calamity is luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This matter was getting more and more complicated. Tang Doudou couldn’t make sense of it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to worry about these things for now. For the time being, you just need to guard the position of Alliance Head carefully and not drag the City Lord down.” Bai Feiyun finally finished sorting through the mountain of letters. “Also, I’ll remind you one more time to hurry and move Yuner away. Elder Yu has likely already reached the city by now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? That fast?” Tang Doudou hastily stood up. Without waiting for Bai Feiyun to urge her again, she turned around to find Wu Li and the others so that they could help her move Yuner to the neighboring courtyard. She only felt reassured after telling Wu Li and the others to stay in that courtyard, before returning to the Alliance Head Residence, only to run into Elder Yu who just happened to be walking in.</span></p>
