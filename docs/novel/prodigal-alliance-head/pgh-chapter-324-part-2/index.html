 <p><b>Chapter 324.2: You'll Catch Cold if You Sleep on the Ground</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Forget it, I said too much. It's probably hard for you to accept it all at once." Gu Xun watched her brows furrow for a while, then shifted away from this topic with a laugh. "In any case, I hope Alliance Head Li will keep these matters secret for me, especially from my brother."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun's qualms were not unfounded. She had personally seen Bai Feiyun visit Bai Luoqing before she left Huai City. In addition, Bai Feiyun's behavior truly has been strange lately. He had actually put poison on Jun Xin's injury. That was something she couldn't tolerate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since I've told you everything, Alliance Head Li, shouldn't you also show me your bottom line?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"For now, I won't say whether I agree to this yet. I'd like to first ask, Boss Gu, how are you so sure I can help you? You should be able to see that I can barely protect myself right now. After my identity has been revealed, I don't even know how to get back to Huai City, so how am I supposed to help you?" asked Tang Doudou with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun seemed to have expected this as he replied with a laugh, "Alliance Head Li, I naturally plan to guarantee your safety after getting you into this situation. Don't worry, I'll make sure you get back to Huai City safely."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Really?" Tang Doudou glanced at him skeptically. "Boss Gu, there's one more thing that I don't understand."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun poured himself another cup. "You don't understand why I'm helping you so much?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right! I already owe you a lot for saving Baili Yu, so there's really no need for you to go through so much extra lengths. However, you were waiting for me to come, weren't you? You hid Baili Yu on purpose, not due to circumstances like you've said."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li is truly intelligent. That's right, I do have something I need your help with."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded. "I won't try to guess anymore, please just state it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head, I want the position of alliance head." Gu Xun had a very bright smile on his face. "Alliance Head Li, are you willing?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't know how to express her current feelings. She was shocked, surprised, and confused. Why would Gu Xun, a businessman, want to become the martial arts alliance head?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li must be curious why a businessman like me chose to ask for your alliance head position instead of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was correct. As of now, both Baili Yu and she was in his hands, so it'd be quite easy for him to force them to give him the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce. However, it would be much harder to get the alliance head position since Cloud City also had a say in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"However, I can't tell you the details." Gu Xun stood up, then glanced out the window. "It's already quite late, so I won't impose upon you two further. Alliance Head Li, please consider what I said before. I hope to receive a favorable reply tomorrow. That would be good for both of us."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said that, he turned and left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a courtesan came in to clean up the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This courtesan was familiar. It was Jin Yi, who had served her last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If Sir Tang has any needs, just call. Jin Yi will be guarding the door outside." After Jin Yi finished clearing the table, he lowered his eyes and spoke demerely to Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at him, then suddenly rushed towards him with a dagger in hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi hadn't expected her to attack so suddenly without a word. When he saw that her dagger was heading towards his neck, he instantly dodged to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he recovered his calm, Tang Doudou was no longer attacking. He realized that he had revealed himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't ask any questions and just blew the dust off her dagger before saying, "I got it. You can withdraw."</span><span style>"Understood, Sir Tang." Jin Yi couldn't do anything about it. He had no choice but to tell his master that Tang Doudou already found out that he knew martial arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he left, Tang Doudou finally turned around. Baili Yu with gazing at her with confusion in his eyes, so she reached out and wrapped her arms around him. "Ah, I feel like I'm about to die. I need big evil spirit's hugs and kisses to revive."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu indulgently pulled her into his arms and softly pecked her lips. Frustration appeared in his eyes as he said, "I really want to help you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, but I can't have you helping me all the time. It's about time for me to help you out instead." Tang Doudou greedily inhaled Baili Yu's comforting scent. "Since I know the true identity of the owner now, I'll agree to his request tomorrow. Afterwards, he'll definitely help get us back to Huai City."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then what are you still worried about?" asked Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sighed. "I'm worried that he's oversimplifying things."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But he seems to be pretty confident."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's because he doesn't know about our enemies. If he had enough power to stand against our enemies, he wouldn't need our help to defeat the Bai family." Tang Doudou furrowed her brows worriedly. This matter was getting more and more complicated. The thing that confused her the most was who exactly was pulling the strings behind the curtain. What was that person's motive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything seemed coincidental, but it was all intricately linked. It wasn't something that she could figure out with her tiny brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So right now, she could only go with her usual style and move through things step by step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, she wasn't going to get separated from Baili Yu again. She glanced towards the bed, then laughed mischievously. "This day has been exhausting, let's go to sleep."</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it had been the past Baili Yu, he definitely would've picked her up happily and headed towards the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, presently, Baili Yu nodded seriously in agreement. "It is about time to rest. I'll help you prepare the bed. You can sleep on the bed today, I'll sleep on the floor."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's jaw dropped to the ground. Baili Yu was being so decent! Was this still her big evil spirit?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?" When Baili Yu saw that she seemed astonished, confusion flashed through his eyes. Did he say something wrong?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou used her hands to close her mouth, then asked, "Are you really going to sleep on the ground?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu furrowed his brows. "En, what is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou fidgeted with the hem of her garment and muttered, "It's pretty cold today, and you no longer have martial arts. Won't you catch a cold sleeping on the ground?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, I didn't consider this." Baili Yu stared at the little woman in front of him that was affecting shyness. He seemed to understand her meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then, why, why don't we... sleep together..."</span></p>
