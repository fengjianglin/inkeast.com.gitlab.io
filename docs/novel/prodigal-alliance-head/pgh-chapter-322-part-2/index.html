 <p><b>Chapter 322.2: The Owner</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng looked over curiously. What was he trying to do in this sort of situation? Baili Yu had better not cause more trouble, otherwise he really wouldn't know what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were Wind Cherishing Houses all over the country. If he didn't deal with this incident appropriately, it would affect Wind Cherishing House's reputation. Incidents like this spread like wildfire in street gossip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he was thinking this, Baili Yu had already walked off the stage and over to Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ask them for the ransom and buy me," said Baili Yu to Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at him, puzzled, as she rubbed her chin. "Are you sure?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't want to stay here anymore." Baili Yu narrowed his eyes. "The sooner the better."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Cheng heard this exchange, his expression took a drastic change. "Tang </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, that cannot be done!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh?" Tang Doudou looked towards Qing Cheng with a displeased expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng smiled wryly. "Escort Xue isn't for sale."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> worried that I don't have the cash?" Even if she didn't have enough money, she'd still bring Baili Yu away. He had been the one to bring this up, and it seemed urgent too, so it meant that they couldn't stay in this place any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This..." He couldn't reveal the true reason, but he also couldn't say he was worried about the guest not having enough money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou made to speak again, but Lin Shuxuan interrupted, "Haha, what a joke! Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> ah, Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, don't you know who Brother Tang is? If she doesn't have money, we'd probably have no choice but to become beggars."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said this, Tang Doudou cursed 'crap.' Her calm expression finally became a bit flustered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu reached out to grab her hand. "Are you alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou moved her lips but didn't know where to start. In the end, she sighed and said, "I'm fine."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Master Lin, what do you mean by this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You guys all know of the richest individual in the world, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Baili Yu?" Everyone looked towards Tang Doudou, then shook their heads in disbelief. "How's that possible? Young Master Lin, please stop joking."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, Brother Tang... No, it should be Alliance Head Li, right?" Lin Shuxuan's words were like a drop of water in an oily pan. The hall immediately exploded with discussion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li? Li Xueyi!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How's that possible!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If it's her, then that makes sense."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled bitterly. It turned out that she had been too naive after all. She should've guessed that Lin Shuxuan knew about her identity from the time he started shouting up the price. However, she still couldn't figure out how he had found out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked towards Baili Yu. He was also looking at her. "Your real name is Li Xueyi? You're the martial arts Alliance Head?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, I'm Tang Doudou!" Tang Doudou let go of his hand, then shot him a reassuring look. "Don't worry, I came here only to bring you back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu smiled. "I believe you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wasn't Li Xueyi engaged to Baili Yu? Why did she run to a remote place like this and spend so much on a courtesan?" Someone questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tch, Li Xueyi was infamous even before she became the Alliance Head. Everyone knows that she liked folicking around, it's nothing strange."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hear that Baili Yu was the most beautiful man in the country. I wonder how he compares to this Escort Xue..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahem, Brother Li, you won't blame me for revealing your identity, right? It's just that in this situation, it'd probably be hard to calm everyone down if I didn't reveal it!" Lin Shuxuan's voice had been trembling the entire time. However, since everything he said was extremely shocking, most people didn't pay attention to why his voice was trembling. In addition, the people who only knew of him and had never spoken to him naturally assumed that it was his usual voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stood up and pulled the fake mustache and eyebrows off her face. She said mildly, "The friend inside, please let Young Master Lin off already. Let's not beat around the bush and just say things straight out. What exactly do you want?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strong dragon couldn't beat a snake in a snake's nest. She couldn't just walk off with Baili Yu right now, it'd be too dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, it would be better to take advantage of the crowd and pressure that person to reveal himself. She wasn't hoping for it to solve the problems, but at least she'd know who she was up against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought that it would take more convincing, but right after she spoke, the curtain of the private room was lifted and a person walked out. He was dressed in dark blue and had a outstanding imposing air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw that familiar face, she was shocked speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Qing Cheng loosened a breath in relief. He then walked down the stage and up the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Owner."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Settle the guests down. Wind Cherishing House will cover the bill tonight as an apology, so ask them to forgive us about this incident. After that, tidy up Escort Xue's room and bring up good tea and wine. I plan to have a good chat with Brother Li."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng lowered his eyes. He didn't dare to ask excessive questions, so he replied, "Understood!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After giving those instructions, that person turned around and smiled towards Tang Doudou. "Brother Li, long time no see!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing that perfect businessman smile, Tang Doudou crossed her arms with a wry smile. Truly, she had considered all sorts of possibilities, but it had never occurred to her that the owner of Wind Cherishing House would turn out to be him.</span></p>
