 <p><b>Chapter 328.1: Not Allowed to Stop</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled slightly. "Just listen to my instructions."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> looked troubled. "Alliance Head Li, I'm just a courtesan."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, I won't ask too much of you. You wouldn't be able to do much anyways." Tang Doudou patted his shoulder and had him get up. "I just want you to accompany me out, that's all."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right, to Yuelai Inn."</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was speaking, Gu Xun walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> hastily curtsied towards Gu Xun. Gu Xun waved to dismiss him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't." Tang Doudou called out to stop Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, then she said to Gu Xun, "In a little while, Lian </span><i><span style>er </span></i><span style>will be heading out with me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hm?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Has Boss Gu come up with a way to help me get out?" asked Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun sighed. "This is precisely why I came to talk to you. Alliance Head Li, perhaps you should consider sending someone after all. There's seriously no way to hide from the spies outside!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said with a smile, "It's fine, I have my own ways. If there's no way to hide from the spies, then just give up doing so and head right out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun tried to dissuade her. "Alliance Head Li, we can't risk that!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's fine, don't worry. I won't joke with my life." Tang Doudou stood up and grabbed Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>. "Do you courtesans have any clothes that will fit me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You?" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> sized her up. "Alliance Head Li's figure isn't that different from ours. You can probably fit into most of our garments."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun frowned. "Alliance Head Li, this is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, so I'll be borrowing Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> for now. Boss Gu wouldn't happen to have objections, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s fortune to be able to help Alliance Head Li." No emotions could be heard in Gu Xun's words, but his eyes were dark. He was clearly unhappy with her insistence in going out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that had nothing to do with her. She had to get the box containing the antidote to the Hoarfrost Poison personally! </span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't even entrust Jun Xin to do it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>With how reckless he was, what if he ended up breaking the things? Then it'd be too late for regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, after you head out, make sure to look after Alliance Head Li with your life, understood?" said Gu Xun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s shoulders trembled. "Understood."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, go."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou and Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> left the room together. As Gu Xun watched them, his gaze darkened. He had already sent someone to the inn to search her room, but they hadn't found anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What exactly was she heading there to grab? Or was it that she was purposefully using this chance to do something else?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was she taking Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> with her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun couldn't tell what Tang Doudou was thinking, so he went to Jin Yi and instructed, "Get someone to tail them. I want to see what exactly she does."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, but, she'll definitely be able to guess that we sent someone after her, so she probably wouldn't do anything out of the ordinary."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then allow her to shake you guys off." Gu Xun furrowed his brows. "And, go check if there's any news from the Lin Clan Stronghold."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Understood."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou spent a long time picking out her outfit in Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s room. These courtesans only had garments that were white, blue, or pink...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The styles were pretty much all the same as well. Tang Doudou had no choice but to settle for a pink one. After putting it on, she borrowed Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s cosmetics to do a heavy smokey eye. She gazed at her flirtatious appearance in the copper mirror, then nodded in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not even Baili Yu would be able to recognize her like this, much less those spies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was shocked by her appearance and his finger trembled as he said, "Alliance Head Li, that makeup of your is truly..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Beautiful, right?" Tang Doudou turned around and winked towards him. "Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, come here."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked like a ghost. How was it anywhere close to beautiful?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> refuted this silently, he kept a smile on his face. "Alliance Head Li is naturally beautiful. No matter what you wear, you're still a beauty capable of overthrowing a city."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said with a smile, "This is called smokey eye makeup. Come here, I'll help do your makeup too."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This, there's no need for Alliance Head Li to go through that trouble." Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> edged backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled sweetly and made comere motion. "Come here."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hurry up! I don't have that much patience!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou's tone became angry, Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> started and hastily said, "I-I'll head over right away."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said, "Don't worry, this makeup will make you seem like a vixen. Later I'll teach you a dance, I guarantee that you'll become the most desired courtesan in Wind Cherishing House!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Really?" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s face was filled with doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, time is short so hurry up and come over here." </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> couldn't understand what Tang Doudou was trying to do, but he couldn't disobey so he sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou worked hard and soon applied smokey eye makeup to Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s eyes as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After stepping back and taking in his sultry look, she finally put the cosmetics down in satisfaction. Then she pulled Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> up to leave Wind Cherishing House.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without any hesitation, she pushed open the door and walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hibiscus Garrison was just as lively at night as usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hugged Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s arm and said sweetly, "Big Brother Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, where should we go to play tonight? It wasn't easy for us to finally get a holiday. If we don't play our fill, that'd be wasting this chance."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was pretty clever and quickly caught on. "Alright, where do you want to go? I'll keep you company."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Teehee, Big Brother Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, you're the best!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them continued chatting like this as they walked slowly towards the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi watched in confusion from the shadows. What exactly was Tang Doudou going to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other spies only watched the two for a little while before shifting their attentions away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that these two were courtesans and they looked way too different from Li Xueyi. However, it must be acknowledged that it wasn't easy to do that makeup. They looked like two female ghosts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, two male ghosts.</span></p>
