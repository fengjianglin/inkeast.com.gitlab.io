 <p><b>Chapter 321.2: Self-directed Act</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Tang Doudou was wondering about how to escape later, the hall sudden became noisy again. She listened to what people were saying and was stunned. Someone else had called out a price. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"The price that Sir stated is ten thousand taels? Is that right?" Qing Cheng's jaw dropped again. It was unbelievable that a courtesan's first night had gone for ten thousand taels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone was competing with her? Tang Doudou looked around but didn't see anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as everyone was looking around for the person that had declared this price, Lin Shuxuan's voice came from upstairs. It trembled a bit. "Y-yes! Ten thousand taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's the eldest young master of the Lin Clan Stronghold, no wonder he's so liberal with his money," someone said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, someone else immediately refuted, "Even if he's the young master of the Lin Clan Stronghold, there's still no way he could be this liberal. Ten thousand taels is probably more than his annual spending money!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Right!? Could it be that Young Master Lin has a grudge against this person and is picking a fight on purpose?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's possible."</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the crowd became noisy with speculations, Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. Based on Lin Shuxuan's temperament, there was no way that he would have done something so rash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, his voice was trembling as he called out this price. Although he tried to sound calm, his voice had betrayed his nervousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Tang Doudou was certain that there was someone else in Lin Shuxuan's private room!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced towards the stage at Baili Yu and discovered that he was also looking towards her with a frown. Had he guessed it as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did this count as having linked hearts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled happily, then kicked Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> looked up at her in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Call out a price." She wasn't planning on paying the bill anyways, so she might as well call the price higher!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was astonished. It was already at ten thousand taels. This guest wanted to make it even higher?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How much should I add?" asked Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. It couldn't be too much, otherwise it'd seem fake. No matter how rich a person was, he still wouldn't spend money like water on a courtesan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes lit up with a thought. They wouldn't spend it on a courtesan, but they would spend it due to a different reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted her foot but didn't kick again. Instead, she leaned forward and shot Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> a crafty look as she said, "No matter how much that person increases the price, call out a price that's one tael higher."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"One tael?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? You can't do it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I-I can..." Lian </span><i><span style>er </span></i><span style>looked at Tang Doudou weirdly. This guest was probably annoyed with the person that suddenly showed up, otherwise, why would he add onto the price tael by tael? He was definitely doing this on purpose because he was annoyed that someone was trying to snatch the goods out of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lian </span><i><span style>er </span></i><span style>came to this conclusion, he glanced nervously at Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our master bids ten thousand and one taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Twenty thousand taels!" shouted Lin Shuxuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> followed Tang Doudou's instructions. "Twenty thousand and one taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thirty thousand taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thirty thousand and one taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A hundred thousand taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A hundred thousand and one taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The price was getting higher and higher. Once it hit a hundred thousand taels, every increase caused people to gasp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some smart people had already come to the conclusion that the two were bidding due to annoyance rather than for obtaining Escort Xue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most people were wondering if the two actually had the money to pay this bid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, who would bring several hundred thousand taels with them to visit a brothel? It would take days just to count those banknotes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng was the most worried out of them all. At first, he had been dazed by this sudden blessing, but gradually, the happiness turned to worry. It couldn't be that these two were here to purposefully cause trouble, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that Lin Shuxuan was pretty good friends with Tang Longbiao since he had never seen Lin Shuxuan treat anyone this well before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn't have planned this ahead of time to ruin Escort Xue's first night, right!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the more he thought about it, the more likely this seemed. Still, he didn't dare to voice any objections. Even if this was ninety-nine percent true, he didn't want to lose that one percent chance of it not being true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he took advantage of this time while the audience was distracted to go backstage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go see what's happening in Young Master Lin's private room!" Qing Cheng hastily gave this instruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As of now, a lot of people were curious and had wanted to go take a look at what was happening, so as soon as Qing Chen said this, someone responded and rushed to the private room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, you guys shouldn't stay here either. Go outside and attend to the masters. Make sure to make them happy, don't let this incident ruin our reputation."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Understood!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the courtesans left, Jin Yi walked in through a small door at the side. "Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng saw that Jin Yi seemed abnormally calm, so he asked, "Jin Yi, do you know something?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi nodded. "Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, just proceed normally. The owner is with Young Master Lin."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng was struck with realization, but he was also made more confused. "What is the owner trying to do?"</span></p>
