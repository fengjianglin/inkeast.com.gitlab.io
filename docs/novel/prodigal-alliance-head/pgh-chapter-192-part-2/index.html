 <p><b>Chapter 192.2: Picking Faults</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wu immediately said, “No way. What will Su Yi do if he no longer has that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shoo, shoo. What are you blindly poking your nose in for? Go to the side. Women shouldn’t get so involved in the affairs of men.” Su Yi pushed aside Feng Wu who was blocking him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go back to your Mist City. That’s the place where you belong!” Su Yi’s anger instantly disappeared after Cang Baicao spoke. He walked to Cang Baicao and asked him carefully, “Will that thing really be effective?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“City Lord </span><i><span style>daren</span></i><span style> probably knows more about that thing’s effectiveness then I do!” Su Yi’s anger had vanished, but Cang Baicao’s hadn’t. His tone was extremely acrid, it was clear he was still fuming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yi has always had thick skin so he simply pretended not to notice how angry Cang Baicao was and continued asking, “Then what do I do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the side, Feng Wu opened her mouth. However, when the words reached her lips, they turned into a long sigh. As she looked at Su Yi and thought about what he said earlier, her heart felt like it was stabbed with knives. In order to stop herself from trying to forcefully bring Su Yi away from this place, she decided to head to the courtyard and get some air to clear her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the moment she stepped over the doorstep, she saw that there was a figure standing in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clear cold moonlight shone down and cast a long shadow on the ground. The dark purple garment swayed slightly despite there being no wind, and an intense murderous aura shot over. Feng Wu was hit by that murderous aura before she could even get a clear look at the emotions on that face. She retreated back into the room and almost knocked into Su Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi moved quickly to support her. He didn’t know what was going on outside so he said, annoyed, “If you’re going to leave, just leave. Why’d you walk back!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he immediately noticed that something was off because Feng Wu’s expression was very serious and she kept her gaze fixated towards the outside as if she had seen something terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi didn’t continue speaking but followed her gaze and look over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he met that sharp gaze, he was so shocked he almost flung Feng Wu out. When had he arrived?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hastily stood up. Although that gaze was frightening, no matter what, he was the Lord of Cloud City and Li Xueyi’s master. He told Cang Baicao to look after Tang Doudou, then supported Feng Wu and walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Baili Yu, why did you attack her!?” Su Yi immediately demanded an explanation from Baili Yu once they got into the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did I attack her? Could it be that City Lord Su isn’t well aware?” That sharp gaze soon disappeared from Baili Yu’s eyes but the smiling expression that replaced it was even harder to read.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi didn’t mention the previous events either and simply said with a solemn expression, “There are rules in Cloud City. Armed confrontations are not allowed within the city, nor is it allowed to provoke others to a fight. Anyone that violates this will be chased out of Cloud City and never allowed to return. Since you acted before learning of this rule, I’ll let you off this time. But if you become violent again, don’t blame me for being merciless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he said this was because there really was such a rule in Cloud City. At the same time, he wanted to warn Baili Yu not to stir up trouble and probe him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu smiled and glanced towards Feng Wu. “Since there’s such a rule, how come City Lord Feng’s subordinates are still in Cloud City despite having provoked me several times and injured my servants?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slanderous! When have I sent people to provoke you!?” Feng Wu immediately became angry upon hearing this. She had come to Cloud City alone and hadn’t brought even a single subordinate. Moreover, she was still injured. Where would she have the time to cause trouble for Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just earlier, someone used City Lord Feng’s name, to announce in front of the place I lived that he insisted on driving me, this unbelievably shameless, despicable, and ignorant person that didn’t know the size of the world, out of the city. Then he led me here, saying that City Lord Feng wanted to fight with me and determine who’s superior once and for all. I saw that person come here with my own eyes. City Lord Feng, how do you plan to explain this?” </span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">C: I don’t know if I like Tang Doudou much anymore… People sacrifice so much for her. I don’t know what Su Yi’s going to sacrifice, but I feel like it’s probably something that will shorten his lifespan. And I like Su Yi~ I want him to have a happy life with Feng Wu~ I don’t want him to die~~~ ‧º·(˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )‧º·˚</span></p>
