 <p><b>Chapter 139.1: Clues to the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi probably also realized that his question didn’t really matter as he closed the booklet again. “Let’s go, let’s find Baili Yu. You can’t understand this but he will definitely be able to understand it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at Su Yi, puzzled. Didn’t he also understand it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why didn’t he just teach her directly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, she recalled the question of why he was so enthusiastic in sending her back. Based on how laid-back his personality was, how could it possibly have occurred to him that it was not safe for girls to walk outside at night?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention he had asked about Baili Yu more than once on their way back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn’t help but start making conjectures. He had probably come with her for the sake of seeing Baili Yu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But why was he looking for Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that it was really as Baili Yu said, that he wanted to bring her back to Cloud City?</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she was thinking, Su Yi had already walked out with the booklet. When he saw that she was lost in thought, he left without calling out to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Tang Doudou came back to her senses and moved to look for him, he was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was about to head out to look for Baili Yu, Qing He arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Doudou, Master said for you to head to rest early as there are still matters to attend to tomorrow.” As Qing He spoke, she pulled out a female outfit from behind her. “This is the outfit Master picked out for Lady. He said that he hopes from now on you’ll keep on wearing things like this.”<sup>T/N</sup></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he by himself right now?” asked Tang Doudou as she took the garment and spread it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing He replied, “No, Master is having tea with Su </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi’s quite fast ah! He really managed to run to Baili Yu’s place in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forget it. Nothing ever occurred between them except exchanges of frigid irony and scorching satire. She had already gotten bored of listening to it after that half a month, it was to the point that just hearing the start of an exchange put her to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention it was rather late. It’d be best to sleep first and think about the rest later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sending Qing He away, Tang Doudou returned to the room with the outfit. She threw the outfit over the head of the bed, then lay down on the bed and went to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day she was woken by the sound of Qing He knocking. “Lady Doudou, are you awake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m almost awake…” replied Tang Doudou sleepily. “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master asked for Lady to head over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu? What was he looking for her so early in the morning for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did he say what for?” Tang Doudou really didn’t know how the people of the ancient era regarded time. She didn’t even know when she went to bed last night. In any case, she still felt drowsy so she didn’t want to get out of bed at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A couple days had passed so Qing He didn’t hold as deep of a grudge against Tang Doudou as before. In addition, from the looks of Master’s intention, it probably wouldn’t be long before this Tang Doudou became their female master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she heard Tang Doudou’s sleepy voice, she said, “It seems to concerning a guest visit. Since Lady hasn’t fully woken, I’ll let Master know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A guest visit?” Tang Doudou mumbled, then opened her eyes to look at the sun outside the window. “Forget it, I’ll be up right away. Wait outside for me a little.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she climbed up from the bed and pulled on the female outfit with her eyes still half closed. Qing He seemed to know precisely when she had finished changing because she knocked again, “Lady Doudou, have you finished changing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then may I come in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” After Tang Doudou finished changing, she picked up the comb on the dressing table and casually pulled her hair into a ponytail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing He pushed open the door and entered, carrying things for washing up. When she saw Tang Doudou doing her hair, she hastily walked over and said, “Lady, let me help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked at her long hair, then looked at the exquisite hairdo Qing He had and immediately handed over the comb to Qing He happily. “Alright, then please help me comb a more relaxed hairstyle!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, Tang Doudou gazed at her reflection in the copper mirror. The mild green garment was complemented with a simple yet refined hairstyle, making her appearance as fresh and adorable as a hibiscus. It was not bad!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was not stingy with her words at all as she ladled Qing He over and over again with praise. Qing He finally managed to urge her to head out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou got to Baili Yu’s place, she discovered that Su Yi was also here. When Su Yi saw her wearing a female outfit, he sized her up, then said disdainfully towards Baili Yu, “This is your good idea?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu ignored him. Walking straight to Tang Doudou, he also sized her up for a while before saying, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he got into the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin. When he saw that Tang Doudou didn’t move, he beckoned her. “Doudou, come here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not allowed to go over there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had barely taken a step before Su Yi stopped her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What exactly did these two talk about last night? She felt like today’s atmosphere was strange ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she could think more about it, Su Yi pulled two horses over. As he walked, he said sourly, “Our girl is a daughter from a decent family, how could she casually stay in the same room with a man by herself? Giving and receiving between a man and a woman is unclear, Xueyi, you must remember that! No matter what, don’t fall into a certain person’s trap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this, Tang Doudou got the general idea. Last night Su Yi had probably landed in a disadvantageous position again during their talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so her pitiful self had become a tool for Su Yi to strike back at Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Su Yi was seriously too much. He was already so old yet he still acted like a little kid, childish to the point people were made speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily Baili Yu was not childish. He simply ignored Su Yi’s acrid words and asked Tang Doudou, “En, you’re still not getting on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I’ll get on right now!” Tang Doudou didn’t want to accompany Su Yi in his childishness either. Moreover, who would choose to ride those damned jolty horses when there was such a comfortable palanquin to ride? It’s not like she was mentally ill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi was so angry his nose flared when he saw Tang Doudou fail to live up to his expectations and run towards Baili Yu. He stood there and complained that Tang Doudou was a white-eyed wolf <span style="color: #3366ff">(traitorous)</span>, and that it was a waste to raise her, she couldn’t even resist a little bit of seduction…<sup>T/N2</sup> </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou simply turned a deaf ear to Su Yi’s old man-like prattle. She closed the door with a ‘bang’, then sat down opposite Baili Yu. Yawning, she asked, “What did you talk to him about last night to make him so riled up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu passed her a cup of hot, steaming tea and said unhurriedly, “Nothing much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing much?” Tang Doudou sipped the tea, then picked up one of the pastries on the table and started eating. “If it was nothing much, then why’s he acting like he’s eaten explosives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He probably didn’t sleep well last night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou gazed at Baili Yu’s face that revealed no hints, then asked, “Where are we going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Residence.”</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">T/N - humph!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff"> T/N2 - the word ‘curse’ in Chinese which I translate often as ‘scold’, ‘complain’, and ‘badmouth’ has a bit of all of those meanings depending on the scenario… It happens often… When I don’t clean up my room, my mom would ‘curse’ me as she cleans up the room. Basically, she would just complain about how messy I am, not even like a girl, why I have to wear a different outfit every day, can’t even be bothered to hang up the clothes and just leave them all over the bed, etc. To be fair, there’s only so much space on the back of the door, plus the closet was made too high up so I couldn’t hang up my clothes unless I used a chair or stepped onto my bed. In college though, I have a nice little closet so I hang up my clothes. There’s only a couple coats on my bed. *proud* :3</span></p>
