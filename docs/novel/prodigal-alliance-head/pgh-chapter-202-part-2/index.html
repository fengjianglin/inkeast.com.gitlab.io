 <p><b>Chapter 202.2: Break Apart Mandarin Ducks</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palanquin had stopped not far from the stage. By the time she finished glancing through the crowd, her feet had already stepped onto the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good disciple, come sit over here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she got onto the stage, Su Yi patted the seat next to him with a beaming smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually, Tang Doudou definitely would have rolled her eyes and refused to sit over there but since today’s situation was unique, she decided to give him some face. She smiled faintly and walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi was a little surprised to see her so well-behaved, but he soon realized what she was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was good that she was a little more well-behaved. That would be one less thing for him to worry about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Tang Doudou sat down next to Su Yi, she discovered that this guy had seriously arranged stuff well. From this seat, the entire plaza was within view; she had a feeling as if she was overlooking the entire world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi, this old brat, sure didn’t fear the idea of ‘the higher you sit, the harder the fall.’ First was that golden yellow palanquin and now he was sitting so high up. His desire to rebel was clear as day ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, would he care about that position?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Probably not…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had started mulling over those thoughts again and hence didn’t hear any of what Su Yi said. Su Yi had coughed quite a few times and stomped on her foot under the table before she came back to her senses. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi glowered at her. “About what I said earlier, do you feel that it’s good or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did he say earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of confusion flashed through her eyes. She sensed that everyone below was looking at her, and became even more bewildered. When Su Yi impatiently urged her again, she nodded without thinking. She came back to her senses and was just about to shake her head when she heard Su Yi say with a refreshed laugh, “Since my family’s darling disciple has said it’s good, then the matter is settled!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s settled?” Tang Doudou couldn’t help but ask in a small voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi slanted a glance at her. “I’ll tell you once we get back. For now, sit up properly and pull out the demeanor of an unmarried daughter of a noble house. All you have to do is watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demeanor of an unmarried daughter of a noble house?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou really wanted to cover her head. When did she ever get something like that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yi didn’t care if she had it. He lifted his chin slightly and the manager standing to the side immediately bowed and walked towards the center of the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are honored that all of you have come to participate in our Young City Lord’s martial arts matchmaking convention!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was seriously a never-changing opening remark!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone has probably already heard of our Young City Lord, Li Xueyi! Thus, I won’t bother with an introduction. Next, I’ll be talking about the rules in this matchmaking competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is different from other martial arts matchmaking competition. Our City Lord believes in the idea that true strength is only when one’s own fist is strong. Hence, participants are not allowed to have substitutes participate for them and must participate themselves. If an imposter is discovered, the person will lose the right to participate and will also be added to Cloud City’s blacklist! Thus, we hope everyone will think things through carefully before making a decision!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the people below saw that he was serious, they immediately started discussing worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, the manager cleared his throat and said, “There are no restrictions on the eligibility of participants. As long as your fist is strong enough and you can defeat all the opponents in front of you, you can carry our family’s Young City Lord home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they heard that they could carry a beauty home as long as they won the fight, many of them immediately threw the manager's earlier words to the back of their heads. One even asked loudly, “Then what City Lord Su said before about wealth and precious treasure isn’t necessary anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! My friend, you didn’t hear wrong, that is precisely it! As of now, as long as your fist is strong enough, you can carry the beauty home, and can even possess all the wealth and power of Cloud City! This is such a great deal, what are you still waiting for? Hurry up and come on stage! Let our Young City Lord witness your heroic form, your outstanding talent!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfff</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou coughed out blood, then glared resentfully at Su Yi. Da fudge? Was this a martial arts matchmaking competition or a sales promotion event?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And it was even, buy one get one free!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, this is called setting the atmosphere. Look, don’t the people below look completely heated up as if they itched to come up and battle three hundred rounds?” However, a certain person didn’t feel like this action was inappropriate at all and even sent her a delighted look of ‘I’m so smart.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. “If the one that wins in the end is ugly, don’t blame me for flipping out and directly stomping off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, how could that be possible? My dear disciple, even if you want to marry an ugly person, as the master I wouldn’t allow it!” Su Yi laughed ‘hehe,’ then started whispering his plan to Tang Doudou. “First of all, I only did this after careful consideration. Look, which person on the Jianghu with amazing martial arts doesn’t have impressive looks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou thought about it and realized that it was true. However, what did that have to do with this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was offstage, all the people she saw were fat and short uglies. She hadn’t seen a single one of the type that Su Yi had described.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin had pretty good looks, but she didn’t count him in at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Qiuyue’s looks were also decent, it was just that he was too old and also drank heavily…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those people are of course the main act, how could they come so early? Didn’t you notice that even Baili Yu, that little fox, still isn’t here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps he doesn’t plan on coming at all,” muttered Tang Doudou. She had originally been disappointed to see that Baili Yu wasn’t here, but now that Su Yi said this, she secretly started to anticipate again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, if he doesn’t come, I’ll help you get him here!” said Su Yi with a nefarious smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It surprised Tang Doudou. “Didn’t you hate him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi’s expression turned sincere and he spoke seemingly seriously, “I’ve been walking through the city these past two days and found that he was actually a little pleasing to the eye. Moreover, you two like each other. How could I break apart a pair of mandarin ducks…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he put it nicely, wasn’t what he was doing right now precisely breaking apart a pair of mandarin ducks?</span></p>
 <p>__________</p>
 <p><span style="color: #008000">Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by ed.L</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">[Chiyomira's Corner]</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">C: Well, pleasing to the eye could be interpreted as Su Yi found that Baili Yu’s personality wasn’t that bad after all, but if taken at face value, Su Yi’s probably saying that most of the people that have come to Cloud City are ugly so Baili Yu’s looks, in comparison, are more appealing lmao.</span></p>
