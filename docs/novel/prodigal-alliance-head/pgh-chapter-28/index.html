 <p><b>Chapter 28: Encounter with Someone of the Same Path</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Yin?” Only after spitting for quite a while did the strange taste in her mouth disappear a little. Seeing that Qing Yin was still dazing out, Tang Doudou went over and patted her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you dazing out for ah! Let’s go, tell me where you guys’ kitchen is? This Mi…… Mister will make something tasty for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kitchen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah! You better not say that in this huge garden of yours you don’t even have a kitchen!” Tang Doudou pulled the outer robe from the tree and put it on in a leisurely and easy-going manner. Taking advantage of the opportunity, she pulled Qing Yin’s little hand and headed towards the outer courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin was already a little displeased with him, yet she couldn’t ward off his cordialness. Thinking again, the person was a guest. Satisfying the guests’ requests was her duty from the start. Right now, Tang Doudou wanted the kitchen, so she could only lead her there.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Qing Yin was also curious as to what kind of tasty things she would be able to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a kitchen, but it hasn’t been used in a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was surprised: “Your Master doesn’t eat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin replied: “Everything Master eats are prepared by Meng Yu </span><i><span style>jiejie*</span></i><span style> in the small kitchen.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">姐姐 - "jiejie" Older sister, can be used to address people not blood related</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Small kitchen? This Baili Yu sure is something! To actually use special treatment! Then don’t you guys eat?” She remembered that in the past apparently masters and servants could not eat together!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin smiled: “We as servants naturally eat Master’s leftovers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pei! Baili Yu has that much money yet he’s still this miserly! Such exploitism!” Tang Doudou angrily said. From the corners of her eyes she saw Qing Yin’s small pointed chin underneath her veil and couldn’t help but feel heartache: “Look at your pitiful little face, your chin is already starved to the shape of a cone. Looking at this makes my heart ache.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She reached out and was just about to stroke Qing Yin’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this scene in front of her eyes, Qing Yin recalled the event in which Tang Doudou wanted to sleep together with her and Qing Yin’s face immediately paled. An audacious thought appeared in her head, this Li Xueyi couldn’t have taken a fancy to her, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately flung away Tang Doudou’s hand and said, helplessly panicking: “I’ll bring </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>to the kitchen area first! If it truly cannot be used then this servant will try to think of some other idea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she finished saying so, she ran as if escaping. In a blink her figure was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou bit her tongue. Didn’t she agree to bring her to the kitchen? Running that fast, how is she supposed to follow?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forget it, do it yourself and you’ll have ample food and clothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let’s search!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention, Qing Yin in her panic ran very far and only recalled now that she had even forgotten Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she turned back to look, the original place was absolutely empty and she didn’t know where the person ran off to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forget it, just let him explore for a while. The garden is so big after all, once he’s tired he’ll come back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was going to walk forward, Qing Yin suddenly stomped her feet. Oh no!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master said he would be coming over today. If Li Xueyi charged to where Master was, wouldn’t that be bad?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking of this, her little face paled again and she hurriedly rushed off to find Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>On another note, Tang Doudou currently felt like her head was about to explode. For this ancient courtyard to be built so large was already enough, yet the scenery was all nearly the same. Just walking around a few times was enough to make a person dizzy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seriously this Baili Yu! If the garden is going to be so big find more servants ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking half the day she still couldn’t even see a ghost of a figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah…… Someone hurry up and show up. Beanbeans is about to starve to death!” Tang Doudou was hungry to the point stars were swirling in front of her eyes and her legs were going soft.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sprawled out on her back, she collapsed on the large road. Tang Doudou shouted out two times, then she didn’t even have the energy to groan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That damned Baili Yu. Bring her here was probably just for the sake of starving her to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jesus!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a foodie, to be starved to death is seriously too cruel!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was mourning for her stomach, she suddenly heard the sound of guqin coming from far away. Tang Doudou froze for a moment, then hurriedly got up from the ground and started walking in the direction of the sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking for a short while, she saw a courtyard appear in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eh, she’s finally walked to a different-looking courtyard. Tang Doudou raised her eyes and looked at the courtyard signboard. Inscribed on it were three words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was helpless. She couldn’t even recognize a single one and could only faintly make out that the one in the middle was a ‘snow’ character.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That guqin sound was coming precisely from this courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there’s the sound of a guqin, then there definitely is a person. There’s no way a ghost would be playing guqin in broad daylight, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking to the point that there’s someone here, Tang Doudou was unable to hold on and energetically ran inside. In the end, she still didn’t see even half a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the scorching sun, there was suddenly a burst of chill. It couldn’t be, that it’s really a ghost?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eeek, scary!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turning back, just as she was about to run back out, the savory scent of meat suddenly drifted through the air……</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her nose twitched. Quite certain that this was the scent of meat, Tang Doudou’s eyes immediately emitted light, wah! It’s really the smell of meat! Pure and unadulterated deer meat…… That’s the savory fragrance only described in the legends, so touched……</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou swallowed her saliva. Damn, she can’t go on, she must go eat the meat!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello? Anyone here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s no one can I’m going in~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sneakily searching by following the scent of that meat, her voice was quiet to the point that only she herself could hear it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, this courtyard was much smaller than the large garden outside. Very soon, she found the house that was emitting that savory deer meat fragrance. This building looks like a kitchen ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could this be the kitchen Qing Yin talked about? Didn’t she say that no one uses it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pushed the door open a crack and peeked in with suspicion. Her face lit up with delight, as expected it was a kitchen!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking again, no one’s here!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then what are you still waiting for! Tang Doudou smoothly slipped into the kitchen and closed the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wah! Wah! Wah……</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s excellent! It’s neat and tidy, everything that should be here is here. A little pot of deer meat was set on top of a high quality charcoal fire and carefully simmering. Lifting the lid, a ‘gulugulu’ still bubbling rich fragrance wafted up<sup>T/C</sup>. Tang Doudou took a deep inhale. This is the taste! Refreshing!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the heat control was still not quite there and it would be even more fragrant after a while longer, Tang Doudou was already uncontrollable hungry, so where would she have the mind to care about that much? Let’s eat first and think again later!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Haahoohaahoo*, the fresh and tender deer meat slipped into Tang Doudou’s stomach one by one. One bowl after another, she drank down the thick soup. Not long after, the meat in the pot was gone and the pot bottom could be seen, yet Tang Doudou still desired to continue.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Sound of inhaling and blowing out with your nose and your mouth.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After eating, her brain also started working better. She held her chopsticks between her teeth and they lifted and lifted as she thought. She ate all of the meat……</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what’s she gonna do ‘bout this pot?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was unbelievably distressed, but there was another person in this kitchen that was even more distressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was rare for him to be able to eat something on the sly, yet he accidently ran into someone. What was even worse was, the person even ate all of his favorite deer meat!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Krrr-rack! With a single bite he snapped the chopsticks in his hand! If it weren’t for the fact he was scared of getting caught by Meng Ru, there was no way he would have jumped to hide on the beams of the room the moment he heard footsteps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the spacious kitchen, this sound was particularly conspicuous. </span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou froze. Pulling out her chopsticks, she looked at it. She didn’t bite the chopsticks ah? Then that noise earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly lifting her head, the two both froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then simultaneously gave blood-curdling, pig-being-slaughtered type screeches.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first to recover was the person on the roofbeam. He moved quickly and dropped down. With one hand he covered Tang Doudou’s mouth while a shining dagger appeared in his other hand. He fiercely warned: “Shut up. If you keep screaming and cause Meng Ru to come over, I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou slapped away his hand and slightly narrowed her eyes: “You’re freaking here to steal food too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first she was startled too, thinking she was about to be caught. But hearing the two words ‘Meng Ru’, she instantly understood what was happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, she also felt dismay. Never expected that coming here to steal a snack, she’d actually end up meeting someone of the same (cultivation) path!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hell no, you’re the one stealing food!” Who knew that the moment the other party heard that, he immediately glared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pei, if you’re not here to steal food, what are you hiding on the roof for?” Tang Doudou rolled her eyes* at him, still reflecting on the savory taste of the deer meat. Ancient era is great ah. No matter what it was, it’s all natural; it’s tasty and nutritious. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Chinese eyeroll is just rolling your eyes back and showing them the whites of your eyes. Like holding up a middle finger, but not that offensive. It literally translates to “white eye” and is usually used to express disgust.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s pleasantly cool up there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” </span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Up to you whether you believe or not!” Tsunderely tilting his neck, he saw the absolutely empty pot and his large almond eyes showed devastating disappointment: “Just now wasn’t there still some pieces, why are they gone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turning his gaze, he saw Tang Doudou smacking her lips: “You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, sss, already ate, ate it all……” So so tasty, so so refreshing!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s too much! Not even leaving behind one piece, are you still human!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the cute, dazed tsundere young man exposing an expression of inconsolable grief and indignation, Tang Doudou swallowed down the meat still in her mouth and licked her lips as she said: “Stop that your-kid-died look. Isn’t it just a pot of deer meat? </span><i><span style>Jie</span></i><span style>(Big Sis) will make you something even tastier!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Jie</span></i><span style>(Big Sis)?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hic, you misheard! What </span><i><span style>jie </span></i><span style>no </span><i><span style>jie</span></i><span style>, I was just burping. That’s right, what’s your name. I didn’t know that within Baili Yu’s servant girls there’s even a guy?” Crap, she better get used to this identity change fast! Luckily she was able to quickly divert the topic, Tang Doudou sighed in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I also haven’t seen you before. Where did you crawl out from?” The beautiful young man moved the dagger away: “You say there’s something even tastier than deer meat, is that true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>So it turns out he’s also a foodie ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled with her eyes squinted: “Isn’t your knowledge and experience too short? There’s plenty of things tastier than deer meat. Go help me watch the door.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch the door for what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course so I can make something tasty for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jun Xin*!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Jun(monarch/gentleman) Xin(heart)</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Who cares what heart you have, hurry up and go watch the door!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin curiously asked: “You’re going to make it yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, then you want to make it?” Tang Doudou rolled her eyes at Jun Xin then pulled him up and started pushing him outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin hurriedly turned around and tugged at her: “Hey, I can’t stay outside, I’ll be discovered. It’s best if I just stay inside the building! Don’t worry, I’ll immediately know if there’s even the slightest movement outside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou suspiciously peered at him: “You’re that amazing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wasting words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin impatiently urged: “If you’re gonna make it then hurry up. If it’s not tasty then I will get angry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Butt-aged little brat!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">”Butt-aged” refers to when children still goes around naked, aka with butts exposed</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Preparing the kitchen. She ate and drank her fill, so it’s about time to do some proper business.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep watch properly!” After exhorting Jun Xin once, Tang Doudou took off her outer robe and immediately got busy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, he was worried she was just joking, but unexpectedly, upon seeing her swift movements, Jun Xin couldn’t help but start to look forward to it. What will she make that’s even tastier than deer meat?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In any case, he feels like deer meat is the tastiest thing in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou first thoroughly searched through the kitchen to find everything she needed. After setting everything up, only then did she realize she was still missing quite a few seasonings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looks like, whether it was the snack in Rutaceae Pavilion or the breakfast Qing Yin brought her, it’s not without reason that they tasted that horrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, for what she’s making today, missing those seasonings was not that significant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The important thing is this plaything!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Picking up that small jar, Tang Doudou took a deep inhale. It was still the familiar recipe, still the familiar taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>One word, refreshing!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin squatted down behind the door. Who in the world is this person? Why would they appear in Moon View Courtyard? And it’s even a man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu……</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right, last night didn’t Baili Yu go to that boring martial arts convention or something? He even brought back that new Alliance Head Li Xueyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking to here, Jun Xin’s expression suddenly turned odd. This guy in front of him who has his sleeved pulled up and was currently familiarly and swiftly kneading dough, this guy couldn’t be Li Xueyi, right!?</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">Translator Comment Chiyomira: In bio they taught us to always waft the chemicals towards our noses rather than sniff directly. Of course I never did that because we were just smelling vinegar and stuff. Then my mom made my favorite soup. I took a sniff and tears filled my eyes. I had to put burn ointment on my poor nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">Hehe, mini vote! Comment here. Out of all the guys introduced, who do you think is the guy in the Chinese teaser or the main male lead? Main options are Mu Ye, Bai Feiyun, Baili Yu and Jun Xin. You may nominate others as well~ btw, I have a guess but I don’t know the answer yet either~</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> Do give a line as to why you voted the way you did and I’ll dedicate a bonus chapter for the person with the most interesting reason~</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> If there’s nothing interesting… I may or may not give a pity chapter...</span></p>
