 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 406.1: Can't Be Cured </strong></u></span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu stayed right next to Tang Doudou for half the day. Finally, he couldn't stay calm anymore and walked out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Yin who had been guarding the door this entire time saw him come out, she glanced inside towards the bed in concern, then lowered her head. "Master."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu gazed into the distance expressionlessly. "There's no news from Ye Chuan's side?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, there hasn't been any news," replied Qing Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu was silent for a long time, then he said coldly, "Gather all the hidden guards here. I want Azure Water Valley completely sealed so that no one aside from me can get in and out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin looked at him in shock. "Master, you spent so many years planting them at those locations. If you move them now, all those years of planning will have gone to waste."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What plan is more important than her?" Baili Yu glanced at her, then pushed back his hair. His scarlet lips were pressed into a tight line and the expression on his face was grim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Yin saw this, she nodded and turned to quickly pass on this order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she left, Baili Yu walked back into the room and closed the door tightly. He walked to the bed. When he saw that Tang Doudou's brows were furrowed, he reached out to smooth them out for her, but they remained tightly furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Doudou," he called softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Doudou."</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was still no reaction. Baili Yu reached out to pull her into his arms. "My good wife, I won't let anything happen to you. We still have to go see the stars everyday, give birth to a bunch of chubby children, and open a restaurant… There's still so much for us to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our child will be fine as well. How could he bear to leave such a cute mother?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>His soft words seemed to flow into Tang Doudou's heart like gentle spring water. She sensed it. She sensed his words, that he was telling her to relax, that things were alright… She gradually calmed down and her tightly furrowed brows smoothed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling wasn't looking at her, but he seemed to know that she had relaxed. He intertwined his fingers with hers and leaned over her hair to inhale that soft, sweet scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azure Water Valley was guarded tightly under Qing Yin's management. When Ye Chuan, who had rode on horseback nonstop to come back, so that many of the guards planted around the country had been mobilized, he was shocked and hastily went over to question Qing Yin. "Did something happen? Why are they all here? Where's Master?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin had her hands full with all the arrangement and replied tersely, "Nothing happened, this is Master's orders."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Chuan could ask anymore, Cang Baicao, who had suffered on the ride here glowered at them and said, "If nothing happened, why are you guarding my house so tightly? And why did you guys call me back? Don't you know that I still have a bunch of patients waiting for me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He fired off so many questions that Ye Chuan was too stunned to answer, so he looked towards Qing Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin only noticed Cang Baicao's presence now. She hastily curtsied towards him. "Senior Cang, please don't ask so much right now. You'll know everything once you go in."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao waved his hand. "Forget it, since I'm already back, all I can do is listen to you guys."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, he started walking inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when those guards saw that he wasn't one of them, they immediately formed a human barricade and pointed their swords at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin hastily pulled Ye Chuan over and shouted, "What are you guys doing? Hurry and let Senior Cang in!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>So this was Cang Baicao. The guards shared a glance, then cupped their fists towards Cang Baicao. "Senior Cang, please forgive us!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's fine, it's fine!" Cang Baicao waved dismissively and just walked in. What exactly was Baili Yu trying to do? Although he didn't treat Tang Doudou and Baili Yu as outsiders because of the city lord, Baili Yu's current actions were hard to accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin saw the displeasure on Cang Baicao's face and stopped Ye Chuan from walking over. "Ye Chuan, why didn't you tell Senior Cang about the situation on the way here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>An awkward expression appeared on Ye Chuan's face. "I was rushing too much and didn't have enough time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin knew that he wasn't telling the truth, but she didn't expose him and just asked with a frown, "Where did you find Senior Cang?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not far away."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who was he with?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A group of medical world seniors. They were discussing symptoms of an illness and there were a lot of patients." Ye Chuan didn't know why Qing Yin asked this, but he replied honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin nodded, then sighed. "Hopefully Senior Cang won't be too irritated. Alliance Head Li, she…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn't finish her words but she glanced towards Ye Chuan meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan's heart dropped and he hastily avoided her gaze. "I'm going to arrange the patrol. You should go to Master's side and see if he needs anything else."</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the start, this had been his duty. When Qing Yin had to deal with the arrangements, it caused her a lot of stress and took a lot of time, but she still wasn't able to do it that well, so when he said this, she immediately nodded and went to follow Cang Baicao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan looked at her back for a long time while thinking about something. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Cang Baicao had already reached the courtyard overlooking the cliff. When he saw that the entrance was wide open, he became even more displeased. After walking in, he shouted, "Xiao Yi, Xiao Ren, where the hell are you guys? Why aren't you guarding the door? Do you want me to kick you guys out of the valley?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yu who was hugging Tang Doudou heard this voice, he immediately rushed out and almost instantly appeared at the door. He looked towards Cang Baicao excitedly and said, "Senior Cang, please save Doudou!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao was furious since Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren hadn't respond to his calls, but when he saw the grim and stirred up expression on Baili Yu's face and heard what he said, he restrained his anger. However, his tone was still displeased as he grumbled, "What's happened to the girl now? What kind of husband are you? Always ruining the person every couple days. If it goes on like this, I'm going to make the girl just hand you a divorce book and kick you out!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu frowned when he heard Cang Baicao's annoyed tone, but before he could say anything, Cang Baicao had already walked in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't do anything except walk in after him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"She was poisoned by Bai Feiyun. I couldn't figure out what kind of poison it was. If not for that, I wouldn't have sent Ye Chuan to bring you back. If Ye Chuan has offended you in any way, please forgive him."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Feiyun?" Cang Baicao had reached out to check Tang Doudou's pulse, but was so stunned by these words that he turned back around to look at Baili Yu. "Are you sure?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He was the only one that made contact with Doudou at that time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But that doesn't mean it was him!" Cang Baicao viewed Bai Feiyun very importantly and hadn't expected for Baili Yu to say this without any evidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu knew what he was thinking so he didn't try to explain any further. "We'll know once Doudou wakes up."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao humphed and turned to pick up Tang Doudou's wrist.</span></p>
