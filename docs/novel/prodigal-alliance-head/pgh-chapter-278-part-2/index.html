 <p><b>Chapter 278.2: Eavesdropping</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nangong Yan seemed to be angry and was even smashing things. She didn't know which unfortunate soul had ended up angering this wealthy miss again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that pitiful soul soon spoke. "Miss, if you don't drink the medicine, you won't be able to hold up until Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> comes back!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Karma sure came around full. Nangong Yan had contracted a fatal illness!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dog of a slave! You have no right to meddle in this miss's matters!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yan </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan had gotten some guts! He actually dared call Nangong Yan in this way now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was absorbed in listening and couldn't help but press herself against the wall to hear better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Damned slave! Who lent you the guts for you to dare call this miss by her name! Is Yan </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> a name that a lowly slave like you has the right to call!!!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yan </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, calm down!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Scram!" Nangong Yan smashed something again. Her voice was trembling as she screamed, "Scram! Go away! The farther the better! I'm disgusted by the sight of you, you lowly thing! Don't think that I don't know about those filthy thoughts of yours!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were separated by a wall, Tang Doudou had no way of seeing the look on Liu Zhiyuan's face, but it was probably not pretty. After all, he was still a man with dignity. How could he take being abused like a dog continuously by the woman he loved?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou shook her head. Although Nangong Yan's personality was loathsome, Liu Zhiyuan was also the one bringing this upon himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If my love for you is filthy, then what about yours!?" Liu Zhiyuan's voice was hoarse from repressed anger. Tang Doudou could sense his suppressed resentment even though she couldn't see his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You like Baili Yu and has been infatuated with him for so many years. You often call out his name even in your dreams. You've done so many disgusting things because of him! Isn't your love just as filthy?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Could it be that just because you were born with a noble status and I was born with a lowly identity, your like is just like while my love is filthy and disgusting?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right! You're just a lowly servant! You have no right to talk about love!" Nangong Yan was very stirred up as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan laughed coldly. "Is that so? I'm lowly? Then what about you? How are you not lowly? Back then, you drugged Baili Yu to try and use your body to bind him..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up, I never did!" When this matter was brought up, Nangong Yan immediately exploded like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. Her sharp voice even attracted the attention of the black-robed men on this side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What was that..." Before they even got all of their words out, there was the sound of a sword slicing through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was alarmed. Liu Zhiyuan had killed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, she heard the sound of a door being pushed open. Tang Doudou hastily looked around and couldn't help but curse this house for being so crude. There wasn't a single place to hide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The windows were also tightly locked. After giving a couple trial tugs, she gave up and glanced towards the door again. &nbsp;Outside, Liu Zhiyuan had already taken off the lock and seemed about to come crashing in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At almost the same time, the door was pushed open and made a bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan walked in with a dark expression and glanced around the room, even checking the roof. He only slowly walked out once he was certain that there was no trace of a person around. The sword in his hand flashed like snow and instantly turned the two corpses outside into unidentifiable pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou leapt down soundlessly from the roof of the door only after she heard the sound of the door closing. She glanced at the two piles of bloody flesh in front of the door with sympathy in her eyes, then approached the wall to keep listening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't that she was unafraid of death, but she wanted to know whether Nangong Yan had succeeded with the drug back then!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Liu Zhiyuan returned, Nangong Yan seemed to have calmed down. "You said that you would help me keep it secret."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I agreed to help you keep it secret, and I have done it. Haven't I stayed silent all these years?" Liu Zhiyuan's tone wasn't as stirred up as before either. "All these years, I've listened carefully and remembered everything you said, but what about you? You've forgotten everything you've once said!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan roared with a pained tone, then there was the sound of something being pushed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nangong Yan shouted in alarm, "You! Liu Zhiyuan, what do you think you're doing!? Let me go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan replied fiercely, "Yan </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, I shouldn't have let you go back then. If I had held on, we wouldn't have fallen to this point."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You! What do you mean by this!?" Nangong Yan's originally panicked voice suddenly became grim as if she could tell Liu Zhiyuan was about to say something shocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan didn't reply. He seemed to have started violating Nangong Yan as there was the sound of a slap followed by Nangong Yan's trembling voice. "Damned slave, you actually dared to assault me!?"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tsk tsk tsk</span></i><span style>. Tang Doudou shook her head. Was there something wrong with Nangong Yan's brain?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't his actions clear enough? He clearly wanted to do </span><i><span style>dat</span></i><span style> ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Assault?" Liu Zhiyuan seemed to have gotten used to being hit as he didn't get angry at all and just laughed coldly. "Yan </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, could it be that you aren't curious why Baili Yu doesn't remember that incident?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why?" Nangong Yan's voice trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan laughed again. Following that, there was the sound of weeping and moans. Tang Doudou wasn't some naive little lady and naturally knew what Liu Zhiyuan was doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She rubbed her chin as she considered whether or not to go stop this...</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, how could she keep a clear conscience if she allowed a young lady to be defiled right in front of her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if she tried to be a hero with this little frame of hers, she'd probably be killed with a strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How is he supposed to remember something he has never done?" Liu Zhiyuan's words landed on Nangong Yan's heart like a freezing blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She refuted angrily, "You're lying! I remember it clearly! B-back then, back then, it was Big Brother Baili!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Back then?" Liu Zhiyuan was becoming stirred up as well. "Back then, Baili Yu hadn't even touched that soup. He has never accepted anything you gave him!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No!" Nangong Yan's voice was filled with horror. "You're lying, you're lying! Don't think you can trick me, that person was clearly Big Brother Baili!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Whether or not it was him, don't you already know?" Liu Zhiyuan laughed coldly.</span></p>
