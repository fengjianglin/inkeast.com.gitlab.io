 <p><b>Chapter 228.1: Deserving This Outcome</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had been extremely curious as well. However, she was no longer curious now since Jun Xin had already told her about it and simply watched Murong Yu and Nangong Yan's expressions eagerly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Nangong Yan was helped up, that concealed object was finally revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It caused everyone to be taken aback. They hadn't expected that the thing they had been waiting for so long to see was actually this kind of thing, and she had even sat on it for so long. It was seriously too disgusting!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heavens! Who would have imagined that the esteemed Miss of Wind Cloud Island had so little self-restraint!? She actually sat on this kind of thing..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"She's seriously shameless! No wonder someone accused her of being a vixen. Even if she isn't one, she's probably not far from being one!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shh, quiet down, don't let her hear..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wasted an entire half a day..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Nangong Yan saw that the people around had strange expressions and were looking at her with disgust and ridicule, she knew that it had to do with the thing she had been sitting on. However, why would that thing cause them to look at her this way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shouldn't they be sympathizing with her, pitying her, then getting angry on her behalf?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why weren't things developing as they should?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she wondered this, she turned around and looked. When she got a clear look at what that thing was, her eyes rolled back from anger and she fainted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Murong Yu's face was black as coal. What disgusting person would put this kind of thing here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more crucial question was: what did this thing have to do with Nangong Yan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that it belonged to her? </span></p>
 <p><span style>She accidently dropped it while getting up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that wasn't the case, why would she faint upon seeing it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Murong Yu's thoughts got here, disgust filled his eyes. This woman truly did not have a single good point aside from the fact that she was born with a good status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahem, how is it? This little master's technique isn't bad, right?" said Jun Xin smugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His tail was lifted so high it could reach the sky. Tang Doudou was rather speechless. "This was the 'non-low-class' method you were talking about?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clearly as low-class as low-class could get!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young lady that has yet to get married had, under so many people's watch, revealed that she had been sitting on erotic pamphlets and all sorts of inappropriate tools...</span></p>
 <p><span style>This guy, Jun Xin, was seriously too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the more she found it horrifying. For better or for worse, Nangong Yan was still his junior sister, yet he had done this sort of thing to her. It was unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back on that side, although Murong Yu was thoroughly disgusted with Nangong Yan, he still put in effort on the surface to act concerned. He took out a little bottle from his chest and offered it towards the women. "Put it beneath Miss Nangong's nose."</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the originally complacent women revealed expressions of disgust and none of them stepped up to take the bottle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this matter couldn't be solved if Nangong Yan didn't wake up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still needed to find Su Yi to talk about the assassins so he didn't have time to waste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking to here, he pulled a law enforcement member over and shoved the bottle in his hand. "Go, let Miss Nangong smell it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stinkin' woman, it's your turn!" In the crowd, Jun Xin pushed Tang Doudou, urging her forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Tang Doudou hesitated. The person has already fainted. If she went out and caused this additional ruckus, Nangong Yan would probably never be able to show her face outside again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tch. Can it be that you've forgotten what she did to you?" Jun Xin expressed disdain towards her hesitation. "She's a lunatic. If you don't kill her with one smack, she'll make a comeback sooner or later and you would only be able to cry then!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou also knew that it wasn't the time to be a Mary Sue, so she gritted her teeth, tidied up her clothing, and walked out like she had just come back from a swim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aiyah, isn't this little Junior Sister Nangong? How did she faint?" cried Tang Doudou in surprise right after she walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice, at this moment, was no doubt heaven's music to Murong Yu's ears. He turned around in pleasant surprise and said, "Young City Lord, you're finally here!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Murong </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, what's going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Yu gave a cough then gave a brief narration of the events.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I just went to swim for a while, yet such a large commotion has occurred. Looks like Cloud City's defenses need to be strengthened!" She nodded after listening to what Murong Yu said. However, she focused on the assassins and didn't address Nangong Yan at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It made Murong Yu feel a bit awkward, but he also agreed that the matter regarding the assassins was more important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Nangong Yan...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"May I ask if Young City Lord knows where Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> is right now?" Since Tang Doudou had come back, Baili Yu was probably nearby as well. Nangong Yan was his junior sister so it would be better for him to deal with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Baili Yu? How would I know where he is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Tang Doudou widened her eyes and looked at him with a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Miss Nangong said that Young City Lord had gone with Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> to tour..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, we did tour the lake together."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But halfway through a matter came up and he left. I thought the weather was nice so I went for a swim. Are you looking for him for something?" She acted as if this was really the case so everyone was convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, where did Baili Yu go then? Everyone started making all sorts of guesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that he really went to meet up with Nangong Yan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That woman happened to see and that was why she angrily cursed at Nangong Yan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The onlookers clearly had very strong imaginations. Some people even thought that the incident probably wasn't as simple as Nangong Yan had put it. She had probably been hit by that woman. If not, what else could explain why her clothing was ripped and her appearance so wretched?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for that woman falling into the lake, could it be that she was the one that had fallen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her entire body was soaked so this was a likely possibility...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone around started discussing this matter again.</span></p>
