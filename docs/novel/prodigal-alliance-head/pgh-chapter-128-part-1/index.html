 <p><b>Chapter 128.1: Ye Chuan Has Encountered Danger</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire had burned Five Kilometers Emporium to the ground, yet the Lord of Mist City hasn’t said a word about it. It could be seen that the City Lord had been wanting Five Kilometers Emporium gone for a long time. Now that someone had stepped up and gotten rid of it for him, he must be rushing to celebrate. There was no way he would look into the matter. Not to mention, only beggars had died in the fire so no one even bothered to count the number of the dead. They simply carried them all outside of the city and buried them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matter was simply left unsettled like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five Kilometers Emporium had existed for quite a long time. There were occasional small fights and disputes but nothing big had ever happened until right after Li Xueyi went there. If it wasn’t Li Xueyi that caused the incident, who else could have possibly done it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the powers in Mist City had some informants who passed on this news and this was the conclusion all the informants came to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Skinny also thought this way was understandable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Tang Doudou, how could she possibly know that she had ended up shouldering such a big black pot? <span style="color: #3366ff">(black pot is the blame for an incident/action that you didn’t commit)</span> She was still angry about the previous incident and was about to beat Skinny up when a thought suddenly flashed through her mind. Skinny said that he was the one who sent her the letter telling her to go to Five Kilometers Emporium. Lady Qian had said that the person who invited her over was the old sir. Out of the two of them, who exactly was telling the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And, that letter strip!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had thought that Baili Yu was the one who sent her the letter strip with the seal of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce which told her to hurry and leave this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu never mentioned the paper strip despite the clearly urgent tone of the message which implied that something dangerous was about to happen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t give it much thought earlier but now that she thought about it, there was no way Baili Yu would use a throwing knife to pass on a message. It wasn’t his style.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So who was the letter from?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou’s thoughts got to this point, she finally saw the oddity in all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-yes. I was the one who told you that the lamp was in Five Kilometers Emporium. Why? Did Alliance Head Li fail to get the lamp?” The only explanation Skinny could think of for why Tang Doudou seemed so angry was that she hadn’t managed to obtain the lamp and thought that he had lied to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words broke Tang Doudou’s line of thought. She shot a fierce glare at him, then said to Baili Yu, “Hey, big evil spirit, can you bring this guy back for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you planning on going?” &nbsp;Baili Yu flicked his finger, and Skinny was immobilized. Skinny stared at the two with obvious fear in his eyes. It was clear that he was afraid Tang Doudou would do something to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da f*ck? It was possible to hit pressure points like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to stroll around the city and meet with some people while I’m at it.” Tang Doudou threw the flowers in her hand towards Baili Yu. Without waiting for his reply, she bounced off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu didn’t stop her. He simply sent someone to shadow her. As long as it was safe, he wouldn’t tie her tightly to his side. This way of thinking was actually not much different from Tang Doudou’s.<sup>E/C</sup> </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re called Skinny?” Baili Yu only shifted his gaze to Skinny after Tang Doudou’s figure could no longer be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still recognize me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That day, he had arrived in Mist City unconscious. Qing He and the others were worried about attracting too much attention, so they had people carry the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin into Mist City first while a few other maids carried him into Mist City through another entrance. Unexpectedly, along the way someone had mounted a sneak attack. The maids had been hindered and in a moment of negligence, he had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he woke up, the first feeling that hit him was the pain from his back injury. When he opened his eyes, he saw that he was already in Mist City and immediately realized that this was something Ye Chuan had arranged. Soon, however, he noticed that something was wrong. He wasn’t in the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, he was being carried into a courtyard by this Skinny and another fat person. After listening to some amusing things, he escaped while no one was around and returned to the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he got to the Chamber of Commerce, he learned that Ye Chuan and Tang Doudou were already rushing this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some unknown reason though, Ye Chuan and Tang Doudou had split up en route and Tang Doudou left first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The direction she headed in was correct, so it was likely that Ye Chuan had given her the map. However, due to the things he heard and the incident he had encountered, he immediately became worried about that girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right when he was about to send people to receive her, one of his informants told him that Skinny and that fatty had carried something into the city again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t see the later events personally due to being busy trying to recuperate, his subordinates had reported everything to him in detail. That was how he had managed to appear in Five Kilometers Emporium right in time.</span></p>
