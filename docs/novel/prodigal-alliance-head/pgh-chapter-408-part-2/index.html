 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 408.2: Baili Yiling's Suspicions </strong></u></span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming slowly approached the trap Baili Yiling was in and asked with feigned concern, "How did you end up here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling immediately started crying even harder like she had suffered a huge grievance. Her entire body trembled uncontrollably. "I found my relatives in the city, but who would've expected that they didn't want to shelter me? When they saw that I had pretty good looks, they decided to sell me to a male brothel… Wuwuuu… They even snatched all the possessions my parents left me and locked me in the firewood shed. It took me a lot of effort to escape, but the sky was getting dark and this was my first time here. I didn't know my way around and I was also scared that they'd catch me again, so I ran into the forest to hide. However, I ended up falling into this trap…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words were filled with emotion and very realistic. That combined with her acting—she was sobbing so hard she looked about to faint—made Murong Ming's wariness fade. This person was pitiful, but he wasn't a good person either. This young man's looks were truly not bad, and he seemed delicate and tender as well. He fitted the tastes of that sire perfectly. If he brought this person over, he'd definitely obtain the sire's favor and his chances of getting revenge would definitely increase. Murong Ming quickly adjusted his plan, then said sympathetically, "Poor kid, you've gone through a lot."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling sighed sadly and looked up at the moon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming said, "Give me your hand, I'll pull you up."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling glanced at him gratefully and stretched out her hand. Murong Ming grabbed it and pulled her up with a soft tug. As he was doing this, he felt that this person's figure was light as that of a willow's and became even more determined to bring this person back. If he offered this person, that sire probably wouldn't even care about Jun Xin anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's your name?" Murong Ming released Baili Yiling's hand right after he pulled her up. He could still feel the lingering soft sensation, but he recalled that the other party was a man and felt disgusted by his own thoughts. He wasn't homosexual!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yiling saw that Murong Ming intended to bring her back to the manor, she said, "This one's surname is Lin and the given name is just Ling! Wonder what Benefactor's name is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Benefactor?" Murong Ming smiled. "It was just a passing effort, no need to be so polite. Lin Ling? What a nice name. Since you're safe, you should hurry and leave. This forest isn't safe."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling was well aware that he was just doing this for show, so she made a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming immediately caught it and asked softly, "Do you have nowhere to go?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming then said, "How about this? I have a manor near this forest. If you don't mind, you can stay for a night at my manor and leave tomorrow. It'd be much safer to travel during the day for someone like you who has such good looks!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But, how can I trouble Benefactor…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's no trouble at all, and stop calling me benefactor. My surname is Murong. If you don't mind, you can just call me Big Brother Murong!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling's brows furrowed imperceptibly. Murong? Was he someone of the Murong family?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crap! If he was really someone of the Murong family, had he already seen through who she was? And she had stupidly spent so long acting. Seriously…</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lin Ling? What's wrong? Your pallor seems terrible!" Just as she was spacing out, Murong Ming spoke again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling forced a smile. "To tell the truth, I've been traveling without rest the past few days. I'm sleepy and hungry, so I don't feel very well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming said, "Then what are you still waiting for? Come with me to the manor so that you can wash up, have some food, and rest properly. If you don't rest up, how will you have the energy to travel tomorrow?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling hesitated for a while before finally nodding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Murong family was also involved? That was just more reason for her to get to the bottom of things!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether it was a trap or not, it'd become clear once she went!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling walked back to the manor with Murong Ming. when the guards saw Murong Ming bring a handsome young man back, they were puzzled but they didn't dare to ask any questions and just opened the door for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling hesitated again, but when she walked in, she didn't find anything out of the ordinary. The only thing was, the surroundings were very quiet. It didn't really seem like anyone lived here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You should rest for a while first. I'll have someone bring you bath water. After washing up, you should eat something, then hurry and rest!" Murong Ming brought her to a clean guest room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling looked around the room. She felt that there was something off with this room, but she couldn't figure out what exactly it was and could only nod for now. "Then I'll have to trouble Big Brother Murong!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"All encounters outside the door is fate. Since we happened to have fate, there's no need to be so polite. I'll go instruct the servants, you can sit down first."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw Murong Ming off at the door. Once he walked away, her expression darkened and she walked back into the room and scrutinized the place. After a moment, she walked towards a lit candle and used the pick to lift out a tiny black-colored thread.</span></p>
