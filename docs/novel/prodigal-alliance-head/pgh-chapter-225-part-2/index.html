 <p><b>Chapter 225.2: Refuse to Take the Offered Toast and Having to Take the Punishment Drink</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>He discovered a figure near the cliff to the left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person's back was facing them. His black hair was pulled up into a high ponytail and he was wearing a black outfit that showed his broad back and slender waist. When the sharp cold wind of the mountain blew, the corners of his robes were swept up, revealing a pair of long legs that were slightly bent as he leaned against the rock wall. As if he had sensed the person's gaze, he turned to look in this direction. His unruly eyes seemed to contain the light of stars as he grinned nefariously. "Hai, long time no see ah, Saint Envoy Xiang."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ming Mengxin?" asked that person in an uncertain tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the Saint Envoys wore a black robe that concealed them from head to toe in order to avoid letting people discover their true appearances. Due to this, even if two Saint Envoys encountered each other on the streets without a mask, they likely wouldn't recognize each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ming Mengxing was a special case though. His blood didn't dry up and his flesh didn't lose its luster despite the fact that he practiced the Saint Envoys' martial arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, very few Saint Envoys had seen his true appearance. The only reason Saint Envoy Xiang had ventured this guess was because of his unique eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Saint Envoy Xiang truly has a short memory, characteristic of eminent persons. We saw each other just last month in Green Maple City. How could you have forgotten me so soon?" Jun Xin walked over slowly. As the faint blue light floated in front, lighting the way, it made it seem as if he was treading on starlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words verified his identity. He was undoubtedly Ming Mengxin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saint Envoy Xiang stood up and stared at Ming Mengxin. "Are you betraying the Saint Tribe?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Betraying? When have I ever been loyal to it?" Jun Xin smiled demonically as he caught the antique lamp. "I was just borrowing it to investigate some things. What stupid Saint Tribe? They're just a bunch of lunatics delusionally trying to revive some Saint Tribe. How laughable..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You!" Saint Envoy Xiang was so enraged by his tone that he almost coughed blood, but he couldn't find the words to refute and could only say, "The Saint Tribes won't forgive you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How naive. Do you think the Saint Tribes would find out?" asked Jun Xin with an evil smirk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saint Envoy Xiang's face immediately turned pale as panic appeared in his eyes. It was already hard enough to deal with Baili Yu, yet Ming Mengxin had shown up as well. From the looks of it, he was going to fall here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His gaze darkened, then he quickly pulled out five Thunderbolt Beads and threw them towards Jun Xin and Baili Yu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunderbolt Beads were concealed weapons that had immense damage power. Even pinnacle experts couldn't underestimate them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single bead already costed a shocking amount, but for the sake of escaping, he could only endure the emotional pain and throw out five of them at once. He was about to take advantage of this chance to escape when he saw that the beads had stopped in mid air while still spinning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunderbolt Beads only exploded once they made contact with something. Now that they had been stopped in the air, they couldn't do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saint Envoy Xiang was stunned. Has Baili Yu's martial arts already reached this level?</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be able to block something in midair, was this still martial arts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he no longer had much more time to think about this as the Thunderbolt Beads were now flying back at him. He didn't have the ability to stop the beads in midair and could only retreat backwards. However, the beads continued chasing after him as if Baili Yu was controlling them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't play around anymore, she's still at Blue Moon Lake!" Jun Xin inwardly sighed as he watched Saint Envoy Xiang being chased around by the Thunderbolt Beads. Baili Yu was seriously a devil. He was probably the only one in the world that could toy with a Saint Envoy like he was a little mouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good thing he had turned back early and didn't continue opposing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Baili Yu gave a light laugh. "With the Mandate of Heaven's Child there, nothing will happen to her..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, right after he spoke, they saw a figure running towards them as if his life depended on it. Naturally, the person was Yuner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Tang Doudou wasn't next to him. When they saw his flustered appearance, both of them simultaneously had bad premonitions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu extended his hand and the Thunderbolt Beads immediately stopped. Before Saint Envoy Xiang could even react, they shot forward again. With a loud bang, they smashed into the tree next to him, injuring him with the enormous shockwave. His eyes rolled back and he instantly passed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Jun Xin was already heading towards Yuner. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu's expression turned serious as he called, "Ye Chuan."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan walked out of the forest leading a group of subordinates. He looked towards the ground at Saint Envoy Xiang, then instructed his subordinates to carry him away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? You said that she's been poisoned? And she's even disappeared?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yu walked over, it was right in time to hear Jun Xin's angry shouting. "What exactly have you been doing!? Why didn't you keep an eye on her!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah Xin, you'll scare Yuner." Baili Yu put his hand on Jun Xin's shoulder, indicating for him to calm down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jun Xin refused. He had only agreed to help Baili Yu because he guaranteed to protect her. But it's only been a few days and something had happened to the person again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Quit trying to brush it over. If something happens to her this time, even if you try to kill me I'll still bring her away!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he grabbed Yuner and made to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu shook his head, feeling helpless in face of Jun Xin's irascible personality. However, he suppressed his temper and blocked him. "I've said that nothing would happen to her, so she'll be fine."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin frowned and shouted, "The person's already disappeared! What's the use in you saying this? Move! I'm going to look for her!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah Xin, it was probably the mysterious black-clothed person that took her away. Could it be that you're not curious who he is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin continued to be furious. "Of course I want to know, but there's no way I want to find out like this! If she found out you did this, she'll definitely hate you to death!"</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">C: "That person's back was facing them..." Omg, this is so similar to a description of a girl. Just take out the broad back and exchange the robe for a skirt lol.</span></p>
