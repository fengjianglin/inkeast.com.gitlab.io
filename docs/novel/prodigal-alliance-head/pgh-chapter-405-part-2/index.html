 <p><span style>"When I headed over, I didn't notice any trace of him," said Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling's brows furrowed. "Big Brother, you mean?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah Xin won't do anything to harm Doudou. The person behind everything had probably shown himself so he went to follow. However, at his level of martial arts, he definitely won't be able to deal with that person. Yiling, take this and get in touch with the people of Wind Shadow and have them assist Ah Xin. You should go as well. Ah Xin tends to miss details, so help him keep an eye on that person. Remember, don't make any rash moves. Pass this message onto him as well. He'll understand."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, Baili Yu untied a jade whistle and passed it to her. "After you blow it, people of Wind Shadow will get in touch with you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wind Shadow?" Baili Yiling accepted the whistle. "Is it Feng Long and the others?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu looked at her. "En, they are Feng Long's subordinates, but she's currently keeping an eye on Yun Hai in Huai City right now, so I'm handing these troops over to you for the time being."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling nodded. "Alright! Yiling definitely won't disappoint you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No need to take on such a heavy responsibility. Just be careful and stay safe, got it?" exhorted Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it didn't go into Baili Yiling's ears at all. She had been wanting to help her brother out. Now that she finally had a chance, she had to get it done perfectly! If not, how could she come back to face him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She left energetically, but Baili Yu didn't worry much. Although this little sister of his wanted to prove herself a little too much, she was still pretty clever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both she and Jun Xin weren't people that were easy to deal with. If something happened to them even though they were only shadowing the person, then that person's strength was definitely beyond his expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu then turned to look towards Tang Doudou again. He gently took her hand and said softly, "Doudou, don't be scared. This husband won't let anything happen to you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't hear anything right now, but she was still conscious and could feel the situation in her body. She knew that she was on the brink of death and was very scared, but she didn't know what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to cry out and find someone to help her, but no longer how she struggled, it felt like something was blocking her throat so she couldn't make any noise. Her eyelids also wouldn't respond. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What exactly was going on? How did this suddenly happen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did it have something to do with that ant bite? Was Bai Feiyun the one that did this to her? Why did he do that? Could it be that he actually hated her this much?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hated her to the point that he wouldn't let off even an innocent child?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the thought that she might lose the child occurred to her, that last bit of relunctance to hurt Bai Feiyun disappeared from her heart. Since he's already decided to become so ruthless towards her, she would no longer hold onto that past friendship either or the times that he had treated her well. The next time they met again, there would be nothing left but hatred!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Child…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her thoughts came back to this point and she felt uncontrollable fear. Her heart clenched in unspeakable pain.</span></p>
