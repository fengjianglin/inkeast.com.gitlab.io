 <p><b>Chapter 224.2: The Corpse is Poisonous</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Beautiful Big Sister..." There was the sound of footsteps. Before she even looked up, she heard Yuner's voice. "You shouldn't blame Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, he didn't keep it from Beautiful Big Sister on purpose."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether it was on purpose or not, what was done had been done. What was the point of talking about it further?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally she thought that he understood her, but expectedly when they met again this time, he had done things to infuriate her time and time again. She almost couldn't stop herself from questioning whether she and Baili Yu were truly mutually in love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, every time she encountered danger or felt helpless, when she closed her eyes, the only image that would appear was him. When she was happy she would think of him, when she was sad she'd still think of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could this still not be like, not be love?</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the first time, she felt emotionally exhausted. So love was also such a tiring thing ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner saw that she wasn't in a very good mood and scratched his head, not sure how to comfort her. All he could do was stand guard at her side silently while keeping a vigilant watch on the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He indeed did not know martial arts, but Jun Xin had taught him something else that was effective as self-defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small boat was still rocking, but it wasn't as violent as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu was also no longer at the bow of the ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yuner, do you know how to row a boat?" Tang Doudou had thought for a while and felt like going to look for Jun Xin might be the best choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had a faint feeling that this matter was related to the Seven Great Saint Tribes. However, how did it end up occurring so coincidentally, right after Su Yi left Cloud City?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the way Feng Wu had rushed back to Mist City also seemed way too coincidental.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't help but link these matters together. Her gaze suddenly swept across the boatman's corpse. Should she check his body for anything that would identify him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Mu Ye almost died, she had come to fear corpses less. Moreover, this was someone that had tried to kill them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stood up and walked to the corpse, then slowly crouched down. The moment her hand made contact with the corpse, a stabbing pain hit her eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made her even more astonished was that a strange feeling came over her. It felt like something was awakening in her consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tss, ouch!" She cried softly as she covered her eyes and turned around to look for Yuner only to find that her vision was completely blurry. "Yuner, why can't I see anymore..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after she called for Yuner, she heard his flustered voice. "Oh no, this corpse has poison!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"N-no way right?" But she had a physique that was immune to a hundred poisons! How could she get poisoned so easily?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, her gradually blurring vision told her that she had really been poisoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She crouched on the ground, seeming to be in pain, which caused Yuner to panic. However, Yuner didn't dare touch that corpse. It was still alright if only one of them was poisoned. If both of them ended up poisoned, things would really get troublesome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou didn't hear any reaction from Yuner, she guessed that he had been scared out of his wits and said hastily, "You should go call Big Brother Yu and the others and see if they have time to come help!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two boats weren't very far apart so Yu Fenger and the others probably noticed the situation over here. However, they still haven't come over even now. Could it be that something had happened to them as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of whether it was to call them for help or to ascertain whether they were alright, all Yuner needed to do was go out and take a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yuner didn't move. He looked at Tang Doudou, who seemed to be increasingly pained, with hesitation in his eyes. Then, he reached out and pressed his hand on Tang Doudou's shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yuner, what are you doing?" The moment he put his hand on her, Tang Doudou felt her blood boil and surge as if it wanted to rush out of her body from the place where he was pressing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reality reflected this feeling. There was no injury at the place Yuner had touched, but a bead of blood emerged from that location. The shock instantly sent Tang Doudou's soul flying. Was this still Yuner?</span></p>
