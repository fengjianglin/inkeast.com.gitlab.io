 <p><b>Chapter 203.2: He is the Senior Brother</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at Nangong Yan who was currently looking at her with a provoking and contempt-filled gaze and nodded firmly. “I’m willing to do anything in exchange to find out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to make it that severe. You can find out this information by casually asking around outside.” Su Yi’s smile was still filled with delight at the oncoming disaster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop smiling ah! Who exactly is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guess ah. Nangong Yan’s unbridled way of doing things, whose manner is it similar to? That person who she learned it from is her Senior Brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbridled?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou tilted her head and thought about it. Suddenly, an unbelievable name appeared in her head. It became increasingly clear and seemed to match perfectly. Her eyes widened as she looked towards Su Yi. “You’re saying, you’re saying, h-her, her Senior Brother is Baili Yu!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi smiled. There was no doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What the f*ck ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was actually Baili Yu’s Junior Sister! No wonder Jun Xin’s expression turned so strange after hearing her name. So it turns out…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, she had grown up with Baili Yu and counts green plums and hobby-horses, innocent playmates… Then you showed up and snatched the person’s Senior Brother away. It would be strange if she didn’t come to stab you!” said Su Yi with that same schadenfreude-filled smile on his face. He didn’t feel sympathy for the bitter experience Tang Doudou encountered at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it weren’t for the fact that he had carefully looked after her while she was injured, Tang Doudou would’ve thrown her shoe at him and smacked his loathsome smiling face until it was beyond recognition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the fudge?! This woman’s brain is definitely abnormal. It was clearly Baili Yu who came to seduce this lady, this lady didn’t have a fart to do with it! Don’t think that this lady cherishes Baili Yu, that damned fox. The hell, this lady hasn’t even done that with him, and yet already got stabbed. If I really married him, wouldn’t I be killed and buried!?” After Tang Doudou found out that Nangong Yan was Baili Yu’s Junior Sister, the anger in her heart started swirling like magma. It was unbearable to keep contained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, girl, could it be that you don’t suspect Baili Yu of orchestrating this entire thing?” Su Yi suddenly asked this question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was immediately met with Tang Doudou’s disdain. “Do you feel like someone as smart as Baili Yu would do something as dumb as this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t they say that ‘a clever person may become the victim of his own ingenuity’?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you try falling victim first for me to see?” Although this was what Tang Doudou said, a knot still appeared in her heart. What if this really was the case?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi gave a profound smile when he saw the fluctuation of emotion in her eyes. He didn’t continue this topic and looked towards the stage instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As of now, there were only about a dozen people left. Within the group, there were tall people, short ones, fat ones, and skinny ones. All the things that should be there were there…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi knitted his brows as he looked below the stage at those motionless figures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What were they still waiting for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin, who was below the stage, looked up at the stage with flickering eyes. He tilted his head and said to Yuner, “When I go up later, make sure to stay here. Don’t run around, got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Jun Xin, don’t go up yet!” Unexpectedly, Yuner shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was surprised. “Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Yuner’s intuition. If Big Brother Jun Xin wants to marry Beautiful Big Sister, then don’t go up right now!” Yuner blinked his large clear eyes, looking very innocent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after he said that and turned to watch the stage again, the manager stopped the competition. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, congratulations, gentlemen, on successfully advancing. Please go back and have a nice rest as you wait for the notification to participate in the second advancement round.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfff</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou once again spurted out blood. It couldn’t be that Su Yi had also transmigrated over?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this a sports draft?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And to even have a second advancement round…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just Tang Doudou who found it ridiculous, those dozen or so people were unhappy as well. What was with this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rules weren’t explained clearly before the competition, and now a second advancement round was suddenly announced. Didn’t that mean all the effort they put in earlier was a waste?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ladies and gentlemen, please calm down. Think about it, this is the greatest event in our Young City Lord’s life, how could we decide on it so easily? Without overcoming 9981 difficulties, how could you let our Young City Lord see your sincerity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge? The more Tang Doudou listened, the more she felt that something was off. How come it seemed like Su Yi was using her as a shield as he secretly laid some strange hidden plot?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced at Su Yi with suspicion. She couldn’t figure out what this old brat wanted at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, these words did successfully calm down those people. They glanced towards the guards at the sides of the stage and swallowed their objections back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, today’s advancement round hasn’t ended yet. Friends who want to participate in the second advancement round can come up now to challenge these eleven friends!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But even after some time passed, no one walked up. Those that had the ability to go up had already gone up earlier. All that were left were people that didn’t know martial arts, or knew martial arts but were very rational.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who were a little smarter all guessed that Su Yi was doing this with other meanings, but no one voiced it. No one dared to voice it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This situation continued for a little while. Just when Tang Doudou almost couldn’t sit still anymore, she saw Nangong Yan move. The only reason why she had been able to notice it so quickly was because her line of sight hadn’t shifted away from Nangong Yan this entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw Nangong Yan smile towards her; it was a smile filled with taunts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she turned and spoke to the man before her. That man also looked towards Tang Doudou with a slightly cold gaze. Then, he placed his hand on the sword at his waist and leapt onto the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, just come at me all at once!” After he got onto the stage, he declared this arrogantly while looking at the people on the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This only seemed arrogant to outsiders. Tang Doudou, however, knew that this person’s martial arts was pretty good, so she said to Su Yi, “If this person wins, then help me find a really amazing person to go up and destroy his freaking tool!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Su Yi immediately started laughing. “Heh, as expected of my disciple, not bad, not bad…”</span></p>
