 <p><b>Chapter 301.2: Want the Alliance Head Command Tablet</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Early the next morning, Bai Feiyun came to pay a visit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin had a servant lead him over. He then proceeded to wring out a handkerchief and wiped Tang Doudou's face, her hands... He gently coaxed her into opening her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's body had self-awareness. Last night, he had also coaxed her into going to sleep the same way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Bai Feiyun arrived, Jun Xin was already feeding her porridge. One small spoonful at a time, he gently coaxed her into opening her mouth and eating the food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was shocked by this scene. "She's awake?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin turned around and made a shush motion towards him before continuing to feed Tang Doudou porridge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun understood what he meant and stood outside in the courtyard to wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Jun Xin came out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Master Jun..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"She seems to still retain some consciousness. When I talk to her about simple things, she can understand and she can also do basic movements." Jun Xin told Bai Feiyun about everything he had observed while taking care of Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn't trust Bai Feiyun, but Tang Doudou still needed Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was silent for a while before he replied with his usual gentle smile, "It seems like Alliance Head's situation isn't as bad as we thought."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Jun Xin's face lit up with joy. He had thought the same thing as he was coaxing Tang Doudou to sleep yesterday, but he had been worried that he was being too optimistic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he got a confirmation from Bai Feiyun, he felt much more relieved and asked, "Then what do we do next? Do we still need to find something that can stimulate her?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun nodded. "We'll definitely need. Although the situation looks promising, over time, her condition will get worse. If she stays in this state too long, it'd be difficult for her to wake up even if she wanted to."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then that means the sooner she can recover, the better?" Jun Xin furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En. I looked through the ancient records yesterday. Does Young Master Jun have any subordinates who are skilled in the technique of vocal mimicry?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I do!" Jun Xin looked at Bai Feiyun. "You've figured out a way?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En. If possible, Young Master Jun, please invite the person over."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright." Jun Xin nodded and had walked a few steps away when he suddenly turned back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun asked softly, "Does Young Master Jun still have questions?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> won't spread the news about Baili Yu," said Jun Xin in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun chuckled. "Don't worry, Young Master Jun. Feiyun isn't someone that can't tell the severity of situations."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin nodded. If this matter wasn't related to Tang Doudou, Bai Feiyun's promise to stay silent couldn't be completely trusted. However, since this matter was related to Tang Doudou, Jun Xin was pretty certain that he wouldn't spread this incident around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since this matter is linked to the fact of Baili Yu's death, I'm afraid I can't call the person skilled in mimicry over," said Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun's smile faded. "It was my negligence."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How about this? I'll go learn how to mimicry, then Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> can just tell me what to do."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You'll go learn?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, it's just mimicking voices. How could something like that stump me?" said Jun Xin with a confident laugh. Following that, he took off the jade tablet that was attached to his waist and placed it in Bai Feiyun's hand. "I'll have to trouble Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> to look after Doudou for a while. I'll return by nightfall!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As of now, what else could he say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun naturally agreed. As he watched Jun Xin leave with large strides, his gaze gradually dimmed and he murmured, "Half a day? That's enough."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then walked into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling who had come to visit Tang Doudou had hidden in the nearby shrubs when she saw Bai Feiyun and Jun Xin talking. After Bai Feiyun went inside, she slowly got up from her hiding spot. Setting Jun Xin aside for now, this Bai Feiyun...</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was he up to?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling decided to see what he was doing and with a light leap, she landed on the roof. She then carefully lifted a roof tile to look inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was currently checking Tang Doudou's pulse. His relaxed and gentle features were extremely elegant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone like this probably wasn't a bad person, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling wondered if she had overthought things. After all, Bai Feiyun was her sister-in-law's subordinate and a trusted aid of City Lord Su, so he probably wouldn't do anything to Sister-in-Law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite having these thoughts, she continued watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin had already been sent away with an excuse, so Bai Feiyun thought he was completely alone. He had no idea that there was now another person in Plum Garden that liked spying on people from the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin didn't like noise or being watched by people, so even the hidden guards had been arranged to be far away from this place. That was why Bai Feiyun thought that with Jun Xin gone, he was alone with Tang Doudou in this courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head?" Bai Feiyun lifted Tang Doudou and pulled her into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling was shocked. Could this Bai Feiyun be a beast in disguise?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's body was currently completely weak and limp. When she was lifted up, her head drooped to the side. She looked like a soulless puppet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun lifted his hand,pulling out the long slender needle stuck below her armpit and threw it aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had inserted this needle yesterday after getting Jun Xin to leave. Originally, he had wanted to ask his questions yesterday, but he was still worried about Jun Xin overhearing his questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he took out the needle, Tang Doudou abruptly opened her eyes, before starting to cough violently. "</span><i><span style>Cough cough</span></i><span style>..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head, can you hear me?" Bai Feiyun asked in a lowered voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Cough cough</span></i><span style>, Xiao? Xiao Bai?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's me. Alliance Head, I used a secret method to stimulate your consciousness. For the time being, you'll be awake for fifteen minutes." Bai Feiyun pulled her back into his arms as he explained softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's eyelids felt very heavy. She wanted to open them, but couldn't lift them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, I'll do all I can to allow you to wake up as soon as possible!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I, I don't want, to wake up. Just let me go, please." Tang Doudou's thoughts were evidently very alert right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun furrowed his brows. It seemed that she was resolute in not waking up. He shook his head helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head, there's not much time. Feiyun has one very important question."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A... ask..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun hesitated for a second, then asked slowly, "Alliance Head, where did you put the Alliance Head Command Tablet?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Alliance Head... Command Tablet?" Tang Doudou furrowed her brows in thought. "I-I... I put it... where?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Bai Feiyun heard that she didn't know either, his gentle expression became a bit flustered. "The City Lord needs the tablet. Alliance Head, please try your best to recall where you put it."</span><span style>"I-I can't remember." Tang Doudou lifted her hand to try and push Bai Feiyun away. "Y-you, you guys, don't try to save me anymore. I-I..."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thud</span></i><span style>!</span><span style>Tang Doudou fell back onto the bed. Her eyes were still open, but they were once again dull and lifeless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun sighed, then gently shifted her into a more comfortable position and covered her with the blanket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then checked her pulse again. When he saw that everything was normal, he stood up and walked out of the room with his hands folded behind his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he left, Baili Yiling jumped off the roof as well to land on the other side of the courtyard. She narrowed her eyes. What did Su Yi want the Alliance Head Command Tablet for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was digesting what she had just heard, a neutral but still very charming voice came from behind her. "This subordinate greets Eldest Miss."</span></p>
