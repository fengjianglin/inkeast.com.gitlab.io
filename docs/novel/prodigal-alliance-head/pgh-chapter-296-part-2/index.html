 <p><b>Chapter 296.2: Huai City, Plum Garden</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Su, you came by this small boat?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uh..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ha, you shouldn't underestimate it just because it looks small, it's really useful. Alright, hurry and get on!" Su Yi seemed to have heard something because he stopped talking and directly lifted them by their collars and got onto the boat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, he sent a palm strike towards the surface of the water and an enormous wave immediately sent the boat flying out towards the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people inside almost fell out as well. However, countless wooden stakes appeared on the boat and kept them firmly secured in the center of the boat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Su Yi! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Tang Doudou was about to ask Su Yi what was going on, she saw Lan Jia appear near the shore. His long black hair was whirling in the wind madly as he glared in this direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia's insane appearance gave the two girls a huge shock. "What happened to him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He's gone into qi deviation!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, he can't chase after us! Demonic energy will startle the two beasts in the water. At that time, it'd be the perfect opportunity to get away!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As of now, they had no choice but to listen to Su Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yi wasn't lying this time. Just as Lan Jia pounced over, the sea surged with violent waves and an enormous head emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was that sea dragon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go!" As soon as Lan Jia started fighting with the sea dragon, Su Yi sent multiple palm strikes towards the water and the boat shot forward like a released arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia's angry roars could still be heard faintly. When Tang Doudou looked over, she could still see that the sea over there was very turbulent. However, since they were too far away, she couldn't make out who had the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, even that area disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving that crazy place, Tang Doudou stared at the blue rippling ocean surface that the boat traveled across. Suddenly, she cried out in alarm and jumped into the sea to swim towards Cerulean Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn't know how to swim, so after a few splashes, her lungs filled with water and her limbs started to feel heavy like there were iron weights shackled to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law!" Baili Yiling immediately reacted and jumped down to save her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, by the time she pulled her out of the water, Tang Doudou was already unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It had only been a few moments! How is this possible?" Baili Yiling wiped the water off her forehead in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi just gave a long sigh. He hadn't stopped Tang Doudou earlier and had just watched solemnly. Baili Yiling really couldn't understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Su..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"When we get to shore, get her to the Alliance Head Residence of Huai City as quickly as possible. I still have business to take care of, so I'll have to leave her in your hands."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Baili Yiling was smart, she still couldn't figure out what Su Yi was thinking. He was leaving Tang Doudou in her hands and going off on his own during this time when Tang Doudou needed a familiar companion the most?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was probably related to that item. It seemed that Su Yi's visit to Cerulean Mountain wasn't simply for the purpose of saving Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling gazed at the distant line which was all that was left in sight of Cerulean Mountain. Big Brother, are you alive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several days later, Baili Yiling parted ways with Su Yi and they went their separate ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi was worried that Tang Doudou would kick up a fuss on the road, so he sealed her senses and told Baili Yiling that a person called Bai Feiyun in Huai City would be able to undo the seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling had never left Cerulean Mountain before. However, she was very clever and had enjoyed learning about the outside world back when she was in Cerulean Mountain. Thus, she ask people for directions as she traveled and finally reached Huai City after a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did as Su Yi instructed and went to Plum Garden first instead of the Alliance Head Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Plum Garden, Jun Xin was lying on top of the stone lion at the entrance as he chewed a tanghulu in boredom. He squinted as he looked towards the sky. Woman ah, woman, are you doing well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"May I ask if this is Baili Yu, Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>''s Plum Garden?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Jun Xin had sunk into thought, he heard a pleasant female voice come from below him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glanced over and saw that it was a young woman whose appearance was very ragged and dirty. However, her eyes were remarkably familiar. That woman was currently carrying a person on her back and looking towards him with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her face was too unnaturally pale, so this bright smile wasn't very beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin's face darkened as he said, "Where did you come from? This isn't a place for beggars, hurry up and get out of my sight!"</span></p>
