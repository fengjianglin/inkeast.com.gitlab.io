 <p><b>Chapter 347.1: A Black Inn</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It only took a short while for the inn to empty out. Most of the doors inside were left open, so two people sneakily went inside the room that Tang Doudou had been staying in and started rummaging through the room. Finally, they found a bit of shredded skin on the ground at a very inconspicuous corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Boss, it seems that the woman earlier was wearing a human skin mask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I heard from the waiter that she was traveling with a man."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go, we must inform Yun </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hadn't even managed to get off the flooded road before enormous splashing sounds started coming from behind her. Fearful that it was some sort of water monster, she hastily looked back, only to find that it was a large crowd of people carrying things on wooden boards that were making their way through the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smiled slightly. It seemed that these people weren't stupid. At the very least, they knew how to handle things in bad situations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt relieved to see that there were people that heeded her advice and were escaping, thus her steps also felt lighter. She soon walked out from the flooded street and stopped below a slightly protruding eave to wring some of the water out of her clothes. The rain was still going strong, it seemed that she had to find a new inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn't that guard at the Green Maple City branch say that there was an inn opposite the branch?" Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. That location had higher elevation, so it should be safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had better hurry over. Since so many people had to escape from this side, the inns over there would definitely become very crowded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was thinking this, she had already started rushing over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She went first to the branch, then turned towards the opposite street to look for the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, despite her quick thinking, the inn doors were already completely crowded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't help but sigh. From the looks of it, it was full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to turn and leave when she noticed that there was actually not a single person inside the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was being kept outside as they clamored for the innkeeper to hurry and let them in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were carrying large amounts of luggage and drenched from the rain, so it would seriously be troublesome if they couldn't find a place to stay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also strange that no one from Green Maple City's government had shown up although it was flooding so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Green Maple City was the Steadfast Prince's territory, so logically, he should've already sent people to deal with the turmoil in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forget it, there was no point in her worrying about these things. What she had to do was hurry and find a place to change out of these clothes before she caught a chill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was just about to go find another inn when she discovered that her umbrella had broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was raining so hard that having an umbrella pretty much did nothing, it at least kept her line of vision somewhat clear. It seemed that she couldn't continue travelling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even if she did, the other inns were probably already full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou turned back and clapped a person on his shoulder to ask, "What's with this inn? Why aren't they allowing us in?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That conscience-less jerk, obviously it's because he wants money! He's saying that there are too many people and that there aren't enough rooms for him to let everyone in, so he's saying that he can only let the people who bid the highest in first. He says that if there's seriously no other choice later, then he'll let the poor wait in the hall! Aiy! It's enough that the Heavens are being a bully to people, but now people are bullying people too!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou immediately understood after hearing that. Since ancient times, there have been people who took advantage of calamities to make a fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She squeezed her way through the crowd to the front, then asked the shopkeeper. "How much for a room?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The innkeeper was a short, fact, and bad man. He looked around forty years old and the beady eyes on his fat face were filled with craftiness. He looked Tang Doudou up and down, then touched his abacus for a moment before saying with a disdain-filled expression, "Fifty taels for a day."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. A tael a day already counted as expensive in normal inns. He was demanding fifty taels a day? He might as well steal it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the innkeeper saw her expression, he immediately started shooing her off. "If you can't afford it, then scram! Don't get in the way of this master making a fortune!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person was seriously!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was speechless. Even if he wanted to take advantage of this calamity to make money, shouldn't he still tone it down a little?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if there was a flood, it wouldn't last forever. Once the water receded and the imperial court send down disaster relief funds to rebuild those old houses, these people would move back into their own houses. At that time, would this inn still be able to stay in business after this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Innkeeper, you're being too unreasonable!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right! Fifty taels for a day!? It doesn't even cost that much to stay in a house made of gold!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Forget it. Guys, let's not stay at his inn. We can't let him steal the money we earned through sweat and tears! Let's find a new place!"</span><span style>"That's right, that's right! There's an old temple over there! Although it's a little broken down, it can still keep out the wind and rain without problem!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go! Let's go! Let's never come back to this black shop again!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>That price of fifty taels a day instantly caused everyone to explode. For some families, it was impossible for them to gather up fifty taels even if they saved up for a lifetime. To state this price was clearly humiliating them!</span></p>
