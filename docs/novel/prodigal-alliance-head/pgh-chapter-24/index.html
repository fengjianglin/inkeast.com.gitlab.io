 <p><b>Chapter 24: Enchantingly Beautiful Man</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than the Alliance Head Command Tablet, Tang Doudou really couldn't think of anything else she dropped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recalling the shape of the object inside the box again, it was consistent with the appearance of the so-called command tablets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would Baili Yu be so kindhearted as to send her the Alliance Head Command Tablet?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or was it that Li Xueyi and Baili Yu also had friendly relations?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not knowing the facts, Tang Doudou thought until her brain was worn out but still couldn't think of a reason why.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hundred thoughts rolled around inside her mind. The Alliance Head Command Tablet must be kept, but it can't be kept this way!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou closed the box. When her fingers slid across the sapphire she used all her strength to dig it out, but that jewel didn't budge in the least. She could only give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Retrieving her hand reluctantly, Tang Doudou approached the palanquin and handed the box to the flute playing maid: "This gift is truly too precious. This Alliance Head does not deserve it and must ask Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>to take it back!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She actually didn't want it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu chuckled, the low magnetic voice carried a hint of a smile as he asked: "Alliance Head Li has truly decided?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man is so long-winded!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes: "That's right, this Alliance Head has already decided!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So be it. Hope Alliance Head Li will not regret. Qing Yin, let us go."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words fell and the petals covering the ground once again rose up. It was vast and magnificently gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then that palanquin in the middle of all the maids slowly rose and was about to float away again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Tang Doudou recall that she still hasn't handed the box in her hand to that maid called Qing Yin. Seeing Qing Yin was about to leave, she couldn't worry too much about other stuff and hastily reached out to grab the gauze shawl floating behind Qing Yin's body, urgently calling: "Lady Qing Yin!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Qing Yin have predicted that Tang Doudou would suddenly make such a move? The gauze shawl on her body started to fall, looking at it, it was almost about to expose her body. Qing Yin could only hurriedly pull it back. Her figure swayed and almost fell from midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, her neigong* was profound and she was able to soon stabilize herself. Her clear pupils swept over and saw that Tang Doudou was dragged up by her and currently hanging in midair.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Neigong practice is normally associated with the so-called "soft style", "internal" or neijia 內家 Chinese martial arts, as opposed to the category known as waigong 外功 or "external skill" which is historically associated with shaolinquan or the so-called "hard style", "external" or wàijiā 外家 Chinese martial arts.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't fall, don't fall ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou tightly hung onto the gauze in her hand. Looking at the ground gradually getting further away, her palms and forehead became covered with cold sweat. Silently, she prayed that the quality of this gauze of Qing Yin's must definitely pass the test ah! Otherwise, falling from this height, breaking a few bones will be the least of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incident happened so suddenly that by the time everyone was able to react, Tang Doudou had already been towed flying quite a distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one's expression changed more than Bai Feiyun's. He knew at this time that Tang Doudou's body had Tendons Softening Powder and that she had lost her martial arts. If that gauze really tore, a fall was definite.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Falling was a small matter, but for everyone to find out that Tang Doudou didn't have martial arts would be a big matter!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was just hesitating whether or not to catch Tang Doudou before the gauze tore, when a 'vvvrrirrp' sounded next to his ear. The gauze ripped!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was scared stiff. The ripping area was not far from her. The gauze slipped further and further away from her, she felt a never experienced before weightlessness. Tang Doudou was scared out of her wits. The rapid wind screamed next to her ear and she subconsciously squeezed shut her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meowoo, this time she's really going to become a beancake!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing a person fall from mid air, there was actually no one that moved forward to catch Tang Doudou!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was just about to move up when a figure flashed past the corner of his eye. He paused the step he was about to take, a trace of suspicion flashing through his ink jade-like pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That figure effortlessly and gracefully moved past everyone's eyes. As far as the eye could see petals danced. A dark violet chang pao floated elegantly, unadorned black hair that was styled in a half up and half down style could be seen. Lightly swaying in the wind, that tall elegant figure was like a god that had descended to earth. Jade-skin glowed beneath the moonlight, a pair of peach blossom eyes glittered brightly with a river of stars. In it, the radiance of a thousand types of glass flickered. His appearance was like those of characters in paintings, even ten-thousand words would find it difficult to portray the unique charm he gave off from his very being.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the moonlight he treaded upon the endless flower sea, like an immortal, like a yao*. In a moment he approached and with a stretch of his arms, the falling Tang Doudou fell into his broad arms.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">In general, if you're not involved with material matters and is like above it all and always calm, you have the temperament of an immortal. If you smile a lot and is seductive plus mischievous, you have the temperament of a yao. Both live longer than humans but most people cultivate to be a immortal. If you fall prey to your inner demons you become a yao that usually has to rely on other things to extend lifespan. In some stories, some people are born as yao as well.</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 204, 255)">General looks as well:</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>An exotic fragrance entered Tang Doudou's nose, her delicate nose tip slightly moved. Opening her clear glossy eyes, they met directly with a pair of smiling peach blossom eyes. The whirlpool of stars in those pupils almost completely engulfed her. Just this pair of eyes was already beautiful to the point of causing suffocation, how stunning must their owner be?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stared in rapture, muttering: "So there actually exists such an otherworldly ethereal person on earth!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Otherworldly ethereal?" Those pupils continued to carry a faintly discernable trace of a smile, as a languid deep voice softly transmitted over: "Alliance Head Li has great talent <span style="color: #99ccff;">(in literature)</span>."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this familiar voice, Tang Doudou finally found her senses again. Recalling the thrilling situation just now, her small face was painted white. She quivered as she closed her eyes again and asked: "How many of my bones broke?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never thought that someone would come and catch her. Right now, she thought that she had fallen too hard and had gone into shock from the pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let this one count. This mmm, top and bottom, left and right, inside and outside......"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop! Don't say anymore!" Suddenly opening her eyes, Tang Doudou painfully pleaded: "Hurry and find me a medical practitioner! I don't want to be cut off in my prime!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Medical practitioner?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's what you call doctors!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh......" Baili Yu's languid voice stretched the sound out. Finally he changed the topic: "Why do you need to find a doctor?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>All along, that magnetic voice contained a degree of a smile. Matched with his slightly upturned peach blossom eyes, it was extremely like a seductive yao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Is this still a human?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou who was filled with worry about her little life, was once again dazzled by Baili Yu's smile and for a while couldn't quite identify north, south, east and west. Gaping and closing her mouth, she thought, could this be the so-called dying beneath peony flowers, even becoming a ghost would be outstanding?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at Tang Doudou's dazed sparkling pupils, it was absent-minded and extremely pitiable. In mid air, Baili Yu's faint dark-red lips slightly hooked, his chang pao flew upwards as he spun and landed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu retrieved his gaze and looked towards the crowd where Bai Feiyun was: "Is there a doctor? Your Alliance Head</span><i><span style> da ren </span></i><span style>wants a doctor."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>More scared than hurt, looking at the safe and unscathed Tang Doudou in Baili Yu's embrace, Bai Feiyun released a breath of relief. Returning to his tranquil and mild attitude, he stepped forward after hearing those words and cupped his fist: "Afraid a doctor won't be able to be found for a little while. This Bai knows a thing or two about medical treatment, allow me take a look."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Wind Manor's status was not ordinary. Other than the reason that it does business throughout the entire Jianghu, it would be because of Bai Feiyun's medical expertise.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Obviously, Baili Yu also recognized Bai Feiyun and knew about his extraordinary medical expertise. When he saw Bai Feiyun step out, he smiled with a rather unclear meaning but did not say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Must trouble Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>to help this one put down the Alliance Head, so I can help check the condition of his injuries."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Baili Yu could even react, the Tang Doudou in his embrace came to her senses again. She supported herself up with one hand pressed against Baili Yu's broad chest while her watery pupils swept over the surroundings. Then she waved her hands, kicked her feet, completely in good health. An expression of being pleasantly surprised appeared on her face: "I'm fine? This is great!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hahaha!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>There will definitely be good fortune after escaping from calamity. She was fine even after falling from such a high place, isn't this clearly showing that she, Tang Doudou, in the future will strike it rich!?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smugly smiled for a while before feeling several strange gazes sweep over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>What's going on?</span></p>

 <p><span style>Reacting several beats slower, Tang Doudou finally felt that something was not right. What was that firm with a touch of softness thing beneath her hand?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly lifted her head, once again seeing that pair of seductive yao-like pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lowering her head again, she deliberated for quite a while. When she lifted her head again, Tang Doudou finally realized the extremely serious situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was actually being carried in Baili Yu's arms, and was even being held in the princess carry position!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the distance between the two was close to the point that they could feel the faint breathing of the other. Her hand was even exceedingly vulgarly pressed against the other's chest......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the most critical point is, she's currently in the identity of a man ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu had his eyes lowered. Tang Doudou's marvelous expressions flashed through his eyes and he couldn't help but feel like teasing: "Alliance Head Li, is the feel nice?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh?" Tang Doudou met that pair of eyes and felt as if there was a magical force. Unable to recall that feeling, her hand, as if demons and gods were at work, kneaded it a couple times before she truthfully replied: "The feel's very good!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following these words, Baili Yu started loudly laughing with 'haha's.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stirred up unruly laughter vibrated against Tang Doudou to the point her heart shook. Recalling what she just did, her thick-skinned face turned completely red. Inside, she sobbed, this irritating seductive yao, I'll get you on the bed sooner or later!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Tang Doudou and Baili Yu joke around as if there was no one else present, Elder Yu was the first to be unable to bear it anymore and stepped out: "Since Alliance Head is fine, please continue to preside over the convention!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could not help but worry ah. That Baili Yu actually had a contending status of equal footing with the Lord of Cloud City. In the past they had never had dealings, why would he suddenly appear here?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two unrivaled men in this world both treated Li Xueyi favorably, what in the world is going on!?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>One Lord of Cloud City was already difficult enough, now there's an additional Baili Yu. Wouldn't it be that if his Alliance Head decided to stick in some wings, he would be able to fly!?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu's rough voice was particularly ear-piercing: "Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was helpless. It seemed after Li Xueyi lost his memories, he became particularly infatuated with charm. Regarding this, he was also speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aiyou! My waist feels broken! Tsssk...... This is hurting this Alliance Head to death!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Elder Yu called Bai Feiyun over, Tang Doudou also suddenly started screeching. With one hand kneading her waist area, she beckoned Bai Feiyun with her other hand: "Xiao Bai ah! Hurry and save me! It feels like my waist is going to snap off!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's going on?" Bai Feiyun approached and came to Baili Yu's front. His dignified gaze was currently examining Tang Doudou. Just from the few winks she sent him, he immediately understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know either. My waist just suddenly started hurting, like it got crushed by a boulder!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do not worry for now, let me take a look first!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he looked towards Baili Yu: "Baili</span><i><span style> gongzi</span></i><span style>, please set the Alliance Head down."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You can't take a look like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The injury is at the waist area, like this it's a bit inconvenient to examine."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is that so......" Baili Yu's brows lifted, a trace of reluctance appeared in his long and narrow peach blossom eyes: "Then I'll set him down!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though he said so, he did not move. Just as Bai Feiyun wanted to open his mouth to ask once again, Baili Yu suddenly gave a wave of his hand. That group of beautiful maids carried the palanquin and flew over, steadily landing on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu lifted his gown, then flung his sleeves. His movements were completed smoothly in a single breath and he flew into the palanquin carrying Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang! The palanquin door opened then closed in an instant, happening so fast that no one was able to clearly see what just happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gust of rather cold air sounded. Bai Feiyun's eyes darkened, he didn't understand Baili Yu's intentions at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was puzzling over it, Baili Yu's languid voice floated out from within the palanquin: "Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, I must trouble you to enter the palanquin to examine."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun did not reply as he deliberated whether or not to approach.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hesitated. Who in the Jianghu did not know that from a young age Baili Yu already possessed property and wealth equivalent to that of an entire nation. The person himself even had martial arts that had reached perfection. He did not enter the Imperial scene and did not like the Jianghu. His conduct has always been unexplained and outrageous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin was the result of the world's most skilled craftsman, Gui Yun, using up all the most valuable treasures in this realm and a full five years, as he exhausted all his heart's blood to built.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the palanquin was completed, when he brought it to Baili Yu, Baili Yu only gave a slightly satisfied 'good'. From then on, other than him <span style="color: #99ccff;">(GY I think)</span>, everything that approached the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin didn't meet a good end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This matter could be known just by looking at the currently dumbstruck Sangfroid Prince Xi Qiuyue.</span></p>
