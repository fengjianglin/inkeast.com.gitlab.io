 <p><b>Chapter 250.1: A Story Full of Holes</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin shrugged, expressing that he didn't know what happened either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou could only head into the residence with him and walk towards the direction of Bai Lianhua's crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn't have much reaction but Jun Xin was very surprised. Who would have expected that Bai Lianhua was this fast?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And her skin sure was thick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Lianhua was of course crying in her room. However, she was crying so loudly that though her room was in the innermost part of the residence, her crying could still be heard. They hadn't been able to hear what she was wailing when they were far away, but when they got close the words became clear. She was talking about some 'da hai ah,' almost dying ah, someone get her justice ah... type of thing. <span style="color: #3366ff">(Da hai is the sea)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who's Da Hai?" Tang Doudou looked up and asked Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'How would I know' was still written on Jun Xin's face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she stepped into the house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she stepped in, a figure ran up and threw herself at her. As Bai Lianhua wiped her snot on Tang Doudou, she said, "Doudou, I really really didn't do it on purpose!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What wasn't on purpose?" asked Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Lianhua glanced at Jun Xin who was next to Tang Doudou and her lips moved soundlessly for a moment before tears of grievances spilled out again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou also followed her gaze and looked towards Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin pointed at himself innocently for a moment, then spread out his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meaning was clear. He was saying it had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou turned her gaze back to Bai Lianhua's face once again. She saw that her makeup was ruined and her eyes were extremely swollen. Tang Doudou found it strange. No matter how she looked, Bai Lianhua's appearance seemed as if she had just been abandoned by someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she thought about this, she glanced at Jun Xin again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the fire was coming towards him again, Jun Xin rolled his eyes, then flung his sleeves back and walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lianhua, why do you look soaked?" Tang Doudou recalled what this reminded her of. Bai Lianhua's current appearance was similar to the corpses thrown in rivers. Basically, she was completely swollen up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't just her eyes. Tang Doudou looked closely and found that her face, hands, and even her neck were swollen. It was a swelling caused by water, which made her skin look faintly white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't it precisely that she got soaked in water? Bai Lianhua's lips flattened with grievances and tears started dropping from her eyes again</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why don't you tell me what happened?" Tang Doudou saw that she was starting to cry again and hastily grabbed Bai Lianhua's sleeve to wipe her face. "Aiyoh, if you keep crying your eyes will become light bulbs!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Lianhua didn't know what a light bulb was and confusion briefly flashed through her eyes. Then she continued sobbing as she started quietly talking about the incident she encountered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, it turned out to be very simple. She was thrown into the sea and only woke up after soaking for an entire night. When she woke up, she was so shocked her soul almost went flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apparently she had been washed up onto the shore but there have been legends passed down since ancient times of strange beasts in the ocean of Ocean City. Bai Lianhua wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry at the fact that she had been able to make it out unharmed. Then she ran back as best as she could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she came back, she didn't do anything and just stayed in the room. The more she had thought about it, the more hurt she felt. She didn't know who she had offended for them to mess with her this way!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's first thought was of course Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of all the people traveling with them, he was the only one that was bored enough to mess with Bai Lianhua.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Jun Xin hadn't gone back to the residence last night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn't even want to touch Bai Lianhua, so that was even less likely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly recalled the way Bai Lianhua shouted when she was coming in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had it been on purpose? When she recalled some of the things Bai Lianhua did yesterday, she couldn't help but become indignant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman was probably trying to become friends with her while still harboring the intention of snatching her man!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When her thoughts reached this point, she gave a cough and tactfully pushed Bai Lianhua away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Lianhua looked at her, seeming to understand what this signified. She once again made that expression as if she was suffering a grievance as she said apologetically, "Doudou, it's all my fault. I shouldn't have been envious of you and Big Brother Baili getting along."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huh? Tang Doudou was rather surprised to hear her confess this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Bai Lianhua continued, "Even though I've always been restraining my feelings towards Big Brother Baili..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou recalled the incident in which she bathed in Baili Yu's Wind Building back when they were in Plum Garden and nodded. Indeed, she had restrained herself a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But Doudou, you know better than anyone how a person like Big Brother Baili is... to woman..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Extremely attractive, yes." Tang Doudou finished it for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Lianhua immediately blushed and started wringing her handkerchief. "A few days ago, someone came to me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Bai Lianhua spoke, she glanced up at Tang Doudou. When she saw that Tang Doudou was expressionless, she continued, "It was a woman that I didn't know. She was covered in black so I couldn't see her face. However, based on her voice, she probably isn't that old and her tone was very haughty."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"After she saw me, she exposed the thoughts in my heart and said that she could help me obtain Big Brother Baili."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said 'oh.' So it turned out to be such a melodramatic story!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But to obtain Big Brother Baili, I have to ruin the relationship between you two. At that time, I had refused to."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But she forced me to take a poisonous pill and said that if I didn't help her, my body would start to rot until I eventually died. I was terribly frightened and agreed before I even thought about it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no need for Bai Lianhua to narrate the rest of it. Tang Doudou could fill it in herself pretty accurately, so she just asked, "Then has your poison been cured?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Lianhua started crying again with a 'wah.' "Doudou, please save me ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou comforted Bai Lianhua a little despite not knowing whether she was acting or not, then headed out to look for Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason was because if she looked for Baili Yu, the response she would get was probably that he wasn't here.</span></p>
