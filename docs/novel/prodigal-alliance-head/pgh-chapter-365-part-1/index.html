 <p><b>Chapter 365.1: Emotional Barrier</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou choked on her spit and coughed to the point she teared up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Cough cough cough</span></i><span style>… What did you say?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye continued looking straight at her as he repeated, "I want to take you away."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou responded helplessly, "Mu Ye, I can't go with you. I've already told you this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you don't come with me, you'll die." He pressed his lips together. He didn't want to continue hiding things from her, but he was also worried about whether she would be able to take the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his opinion, Tang Doudou wasn't very weak and she was Jun Yuner's child, so she should probably be able to handle it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, she should've found out about this matter a long time ago. It was just that Baili Yu had insisted on keeping it from her. If Baili Yu had told her, she could just make the decision for herself and everything would be resolved. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they had gotten married and now had a child, they were still two separate people. It wasn't right for Baili Yu to decide and control everything. Shouldn't he also listen to Tang Doudou's opinion?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Mu Ye thought about it, the more convinced he became that he should tell Tang Doudou about her pregnancy so that she could decide for herself whether to keep that child. That poison had inhibited the development of the fetus so the fetus was still small. If she didn't want the child, it was still possible to get rid of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, doing so would still have an adverse effect on her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this big ice block said that, he started spacing out again. Tang Doudou had never seen him like this, so she started muttering as she pondered his earlier words and current attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they didn't cure her Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, of course she'd be doomed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it still doesn't explain what he meant by she'd die if she didn't go with him? In addition, she didn't feel much of the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance's influence. It was actually this strange belly pain that puzzled her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Cang Baicao was the reknown godly doctor. There existed no one in this world with better medical expertise. If Cang Baicao couldn't cure her, what hope did she have?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since her fate seemed to be the same either way, she'd prefer to spend whatever time she had left with Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she reached this conclusion, she glanced towards Mu Ye and saw that he was still spacing out. She shrugged helplessly. This guy was seriously too strange. She should just let him think things through on his own. Once he figured things out, he'll definitely look for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she got up and leapt off the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She happened to land right in front of Cang Baicao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Girl, you weren't sleeping?" Cang Baicao feigned surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou laughed as she said, "I've slept the entire day. The more I slept, the sleepier I got, so I decided to take a walk around and get some fresh air instead."</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, something occurred to her and she walked forward to grab Cang Baicao's arm. "Grandpa Cang ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Whatever it is, just say it! The way you're talking is giving me goosebumps!" Cang Baicao shuddered and hastily pushed her arms away. He had long been exposed to this girl's ability to act like a spoiled child. It would be like he was fed water of oblivion, before he knew it, she would weasel all his secrets out of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's talk while walking?" However, Tang Doudou wasn't deterred and walked over to grab his arm again while saying this affectionately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao was completely helpless. He couldn't very well push her again after all since she was pregnant. If something happened to her or the child, there was no way he could take the consequences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I give, I give already. Whatever it is, just say it. There's no need to try and pour so many bowls of water of oblivion down my throat."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou giggled as she walked forward while hugging his arm. As she walked, she thought about where to start. Mu Ye had noticed the moment she had gotten up. However, he just watched as she left with Cang Baicao without following.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had thought about a lot, he still couldn't make the decision to tell Tang Doudou the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Cang, I want to ask if you checked the state of Baili Yu's Hoarfrost Poison while you were restoring his memories?" After walking for quite a while, Tang Doudou finally started asking her questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao nodded. "I took a look at it. Since your relationship suddenly advanced, the Hoarfrost Poison which was supposed to fully flare up in a few months has already been forced back to its original state. From the looks of things currently, it'll probably be a long time before it flares up again."</span><span style>Tang Doudou exclaimed in shock, "You're saying!? The reason his poison didn't flare up i-is… is because…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because they consummated their marriage? Why hadn't she known!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao nodded thoughtfully. "It seems that Baili </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> hasn't ever told you about this."</span><span style>"That's right! How could he keep this from me?" If she had known that this would work, she wouldn't have had to waste so much time worrying and trying to come up with a method to cure his poison. That wasn't right! Tang Doudou's eyes lit up again. "This method can't completely cure the poison, right?"</span><span style>"Naturally. If the Hoarfrost Poison was that easy to cure, it wouldn’t have stumped me for such a long time." Senior Cang then said, "When I gave you that method before, I was thinking that the poison in both of your bodies could counteract and neutralize each other to cure both the Hoarfrost Poison and the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance. Now that I think about it, I was too naive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There was no way the method to curing those two poisons would be so simple. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"However, your mother, Jun Yuner, seemed to have a way to cure the poison." When Cang Baicao suddenly brought this up, Tang Doudou frowned in surprise. However, since Mu Ye was also currently in Azure Water Valley, it wouldn't be strange if he had told Cang Baicao about this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mother planted something called a Swayflower. Mu Ye told me that the flower could cure the poison, but..." This was also something she had been puzzled the entire time about. "For some reason, although he has the method, he hadn't volunteered to cure my poison. It's really strange."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao had already guessed that Swayflower had something to do with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance when Mu Ye had shown it to him earlier, but this confirmed it for sure. His expression changed drastically, because he suddenly realized why Mu Ye wanted Jun Yuner's corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Doudou, I'm afraid we'll have to take a trip back to Cloud City in order to cure your poison!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was he bringing up Cloud City all of a sudden?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was confused, so she asked, "Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Cang Baicao didn't answer her and just told her that she was free to walk around as long as she didn't leave the valley. He exhorted for her to call her if she noticed anything strange, then rushed off.</span></p>
