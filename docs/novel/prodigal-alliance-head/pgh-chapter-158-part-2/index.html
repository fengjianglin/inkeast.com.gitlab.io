 <p><b>Chapter 158.2: The Heart of the Black Demonic Nightcrawler</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin noticed her confused expression and looked down to ask, “What are you looking at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou instantly returned to her senses and gave a dry cough. “I’m not looking at anything. You should put me down. From the looks of it, it’s close to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin’s eyes narrowed but he still loosened his grip and put Tang Doudou on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two looked towards the twisting Black Demonic Nightcrawler again. As of now, it had already exhausted its strength. This was the Achilles heel of large lifeforms. Although they had great combat power, it also took a lot of energy for them to move their enormous physiques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin saw that it was about time and advanced again. He nimbly evaded the enormous flying rocks and the Black Demonic Nightcrawler’s body. In a few moments, he had reached the dagger and he abruptly pulled it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red mixed with sparkling green blood gushed out from that wound, lighting up the entire ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin turned around and returned to the mouth of the bug. Harsh blue light suddenly shone from his palm and the appearance of the Black Demonic Nightcrawler was lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All it had on its chubby black head was an enormous mouth and a strangely-shaped ear. It didn’t have eyes or a nose and it didn’t look scary. On the contrary, it gave off a dumb and cute feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the fact that it was terrifyingly big, Tang Doudou’s youthful lady heart would have been melted by its moe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jun Xin didn’t have any intention to appreciate that right now. The dagger in his hand danced again. With a few slashes, it cut open the Black Demonic Nightcrawler’s front body and revealed an enormous red and green heart. It was still thumping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou who was watching this from far away was very shocked. However, she was more concerned with the fact that the heart was even bigger than her skull. How the hell was she supposed to eat it raw?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was also a bit stunned upon seeing the heart. The ancient texts didn’t record that the Black Demonic Nightcrawler’s heart would be this big, nor did it describe the heart as being this beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t matter though. The item was right in front of him, there was no way he could give up just because it was too big.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His thoughts having gotten to this point, Jun Xin quickly reached out with both hands and grabbed that enormous heart. Then he pulled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pain from having its heart pulled was much greater than the pain from that dagger. The Black Demonic Nightcrawler once again went crazy. Sand and rocks were sent flying. From some unknown place, numerous antennas appeared and flew towards Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin’s gaze sharpened. Letting go of the heart, he pointed towards those antennas and said softly, “Burst!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a magical thing happened. Those antennas actually ignited just like that, then exploded like fireworks. It was a strangely beautiful sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The bug heart is about to come out, get ready!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin shouted towards Tang Doudou, then used all his strength to pull backward. The Black Demonic Nightcrawler lifted its head and roared. It itched to fling off this hateful human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou’s mood was currently very complicated. If that bug heart was a couple dozen times smaller, she would definitely swallow it without hesitation. But now… She was very seriously considering whether to steam it in broth or simmer-fry it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin soon pulled out the bug heart. The Black Demonic Nightcrawler was already at its last breath. All the green glowing specks in its body was rapidly rushing towards the heart. A scene like that of a legend occurred. The bug’s heart that Jun Xin pulled out was like a shining crystal ball. Strange radiant lights were constantly swirling around within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That light illuminated Jun Xin’s face. His expression was a little gloomy and cold. With his current detached expression added in, Tang Doudou was slightly stunned for a moment. She felt like the current Jun Xin was very unfamiliar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was blanking out, Jun Xin threw the bug’s heart in his hand at her.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Chiyomira's Corner]</span><span style="color: #3366ff;">The first time I read through this chapter, I was like, lmao, Tang Doudou’s reaction to eating the heart. The second time as I translated this chapter, I was like, TT_TT, poor little moe nightcrawler... <span style="color: #0000ff;">This feels like an anime is my reaction. :S</span></span></p>
