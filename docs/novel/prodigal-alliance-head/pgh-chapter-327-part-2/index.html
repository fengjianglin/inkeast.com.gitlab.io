 <p><b>Chapter 327.2: Come Up With a Way to Leave</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>?" Gu Xun looked at Tang Doudou with surprise. "Why is Alliance Head Li looking for Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After asking that, he worried that Tang Doudou would misunderstand him, so he explained, "In Wind Cherishing House, Jin Yi is the only one that knows about my plan, so dragging Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> into it is..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou shook her head. "Boss Gu, I understand your worries, but I really do need Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> for this. Don't worry, it's definitely not related to this matter. I just need to ask him some private questions."</span></p>
 <p><span style>This explanation didn't quite match up. Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was just a courtesan, what was there about him that could've caught Tang Doudou's eye?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was very petty and had a dirty mouth, yet he always liked to act very delicate and sweet. Although the guests liked him, none of the people in this brothel liked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun had a faint recollection of this courtesan because he had almost driven him out of Wind Cherishing House for being audacious and refusing to follow orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't understand what exactly Tang Doudou liked about Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>. Jin Yi had also informed him that Tang Doudou had asked for Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> in the afternoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, because she was asleep, they didn't actually see each other and a strange person had kicked Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> down the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That's right, who was that person?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun looked around, then his gaze stopped on the screen. Was he in there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was probably Jun Xin. There was no one else he knew of that would follow Tang Doudou so closely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Boss Gu? What are you looking at?" asked Tang Doudou curiously when she saw that his attention was focused on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun retrieved his gaze. "Ahem, it's nothing."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled and didn't press him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since Alliance Head Li insists on heading out, I won't stop you. Time is tight so I'll go call Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> up for you right now, and then I'll help you two leave Wind Cherishing House quietly." As Gu Xun got up, he glanced towards the screen again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said, "Then I'll be troubling you, Boss Gu."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No need to be so polite, Alliance Head Li. It's just an exchange. I just hope that Alliance Head Li won't forget what you've promised me." Gu Xun walked past the screen and glanced behind it, but he didn't see anyone there. He furrowed his brows in confusion. He had clearly sensed someone behind the screen earlier, so why was there no one there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, Boss Gu, as long as I get to Huai City safely, I'll naturally fulfill the promise." It was a different story if there was no way to get back safely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun nodded with a smile, then left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou watched him leave, then silently sunk into thought for a while. She walked behind the screen and saw that Jun Xin was sprawled out there sleeping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't Jun Xin right here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did Gu Xun look as if he hadn't seen him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It looks like your guess was wrong." Baili Yu sat up and leaned against the head of the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded, then shook her head. "No, my feeling's definitely right. Gu Xun can't be trusted."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The stinkin' woman is right for once. It's best not to trust these Bai family siblings. Gu Xun isn't a good person, and Bai Feiyun is no better." Jun Xin walked out from behind the screen. "There's no way you guys will be able to get back by relying on Gu Xun, so I'm going to head out to arrange things. You guys should be careful, especially you. Why are you heading out for no reason?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I need to look for Lin Shuxuan," said Tang Doudou in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lin Shuxuan? Who's that?" Jun Xin didn't know about the things that had happened recently so he didn't know who Lin Shuxuan is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said, "He's a rich kid that I met here in Hibiscus Garrison. He has quite some influence here."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How much influence could someone from a tiny place like this have?" Jun Xin showed his disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You shouldn't look down on him. He'll come in very useful in helping us leave." Tang Doudou giggled without explaining further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin curled his lips disdainfully. "Alright, then look after yourself, I'm leaving!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after Jun Xin left, Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> came upstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li." After Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> walked in, he glanced at Tang Doudou timidly. "Does Alliance Head Li have instructions for Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and glanced behind her. When Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> walked in, Baili Yu had lay back down. From the even breathing sounds, it seemed he had fallen asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> ah! You said that you had grown up in Wind Cherishing House, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> didn't know why she asked this, but he replied in the usual way, "En, most of the courtesans here had grown up in Wind Cherishing House."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then what about the courtesans that were here while you guys were still children? Where did they go? Why haven't I seen any of them?" asked Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> froze. Tang Doudou explained, "I heard someone say that Wind Cherishing House has been here for twenty years already, but you guys look only fourteen at most. So who worked here while you guys were still children? It couldn't be that Wind Cherishing House waited until you guys grew up to start taking customers, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, Alliance Head Li, why are you asking about this?" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> exclaimed in surprise, seeming stunned by Tang Doudou's question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm just asking casually. Just answer me honestly. If you answer well, this Alliance Head has a big reward for you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li, you're clearly making things hard for this servant on purpose! I was so little back then, how could I possibly remember?" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> pouted unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou brushed back her head and said apologetically, "It was my neglectance."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> glanced over at Baili Yu out of the corner of his eye. When he saw that Baili Yu was asleep, he slowly moved closer to Tang Doudou and asked sweetly, "Could it be that Alliance Head Li called this servant over only to ask these boring questions?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't push him away so he fell into her arms. "Alliance Head Li, this night is so quiet and boring. Why not allow Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> to dance for you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dance?" Tang Doudou shook her head. "No, I have another task for you, but Lian </span><i><span style>er, </span></i><span style>will you be able to bear this responsibility?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er'</span></i><span style>s brows furrowed slightly. This was the martial arts alliance head, how could a courtesan like him help her with anything?</span></p>
