 <p><b>Chapter 152.2: Demanding Her Life</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dead-as-a-doornail die ah?” repeated Bai Feiyun. Then he asked with his eyebrows raised, “What you said earlier were all lies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course ah. I just came back, I don’t even know what’s going on, how could I have a countermeasure?” Tang Doudou grabbed Bai Feiyun’s hand. “Xiao Bai ah…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should go find Mu Ye.” Bai Feiyun moved his hand out of her grasp and walked forward a couple steps before stopping and saying this with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s the only one that can resolve this matter. I’ve already tried all the other methods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou became even more distressed. Go find Mu Ye. Where was she supposed to go to find Mu Ye? The last time they meet was when he saved her from the God Firmament Hall’s ambush while passing by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But would Mu Ye agree to stop it? I heard that over half of Jianghu’s sects have already surrendered to them. They only need to put in a little more effort to overthrow our Alliance Head Residence and proclaim themselves rulers of the Jianghu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun swept a glance at her, very confused with the difference in her manner of speech in front of others and in private. “This matter isn’t something Mu Ye started. He tried to salvage the situation before but it was no use. It’s likely that something has happened to the Demonic Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way? Mu Ye seems so powerful, how could he not even be in control of the matters within his sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He seems to have been looking for something. Due to this, the Protectors and Elders in the sect have started to clash. He hasn’t even been back to the Demonic Sect lately, so they’re like a bunch of dragons without a leader. Currently, the Demonic Sect is also messy as a pot of porridge and not doing much better than us.” Bai Feiyun calmly explained to Tang Doudou. As the two spoke, they walked along the small alley and returned to the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou saw that the stores in Huai City seemed very gloomy. In addition, quite a lot of people hastily moved out of the way upon seeing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? Is my appearance very scary?” Tang Doudou couldn’t help but reach to touch her face upon seeing this strange reaction. Could it be that a flower was growing on her face?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun ignored her and continued talking about the Demonic Sect. “I’ve also been looking for Mu Ye for quite a while but couldn’t get hold of his exact location. I heard that during the Plum Garden Gathering, he went to find you on his own?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eh? That time, she and Mu Ye were the only ones present. How did other people find out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Baili Yu has informants everywhere in Plum Garden. Your every move is within his view. This information, due to certain reasons, tends to be spread out. What I know is that not only did Mu Ye look for you on his own, that night Jun Xin crazily destroyed almost a hundred plum trees outside the wooden rooms, and even shattered Bloodthirster. After that, Jun Xin left Plum Garden and never returned.” Bai Feiyun’s warm eyes looked towards Tang Doudou with a probing gaze as if he couldn’t see through her thoughts. “The moment you arrived in Huai City today, he returned as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Tang Doudou was shocked by everything Bai Feiyun said. She had no idea that something like that had happened after she got drunk. It was likely that Jun Xin found out Baili Yu and she did dat, and so after going crazy from heartbreak, he left downheartedly…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pei</span></i><span style>! What was with that? It’s completely wrong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was back again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This didn’t correspond with the storyline. Why did he go berserk and leave home? And why did he only just come back?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s just talk about Mu Ye first!” Tang Doudou decided not to worry about Jun Xin’s matter. That brat looked like a purely tsundere kid, but in reality, he was really irascible and temperamental. Just from the sound of his name, ‘Blood Fiend Jun Xin,’ one could tell how brutal of a guy he actually was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had no intention of provoking such a frightening guy as if she had nothing else to do. Although Mu Ye was also very frightening, Tang Doudou stopped being afraid of him ever since he smiled towards her last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mu Ye… If you look for him, you’ll probably find him easily.” Bai Feiyun retrieved his probing gaze and spoke after a brief pause.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would it be easy for me to find him? It’s not like I know him very well.” They had only met about three times and probably hadn’t even exchanged a total of ten sentences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Bai Feiyun’s smile turned a little strange to the point it made Tang Doudou’s hair rise on end. Finally, he spoke and said, “Because he’s also looking for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Never would have thought it ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She actually found Mu Ye this easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After silently staring at each other for a long while, Tang Doudou finally sighed and broke the silence. She asked curiously, “Why were you looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To make a deal.” Mu Ye coldly glanced at her, then spat out these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was truly cold to the point that it made people shiver beneath the scorching sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deal he was talking about, it was probably the one he mentioned back in Plum Garden?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last time she had thoroughly disgusted Mu Ye ah. As Tang Doudou thought to here, she asked with an unnatural expression, “What deal could the two of us possibly make?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big brother ah, let’s not be so miserly with our words so much when speaking, alright? It’s not like I charge you per word!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou silently criticized as she rubbed her nose. Recalling what Bai Feiyun told her earlier, her heart calmed down and she asked, “Then what you’re saying is that what you’re looking for is with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye’s cold gaze swept over, sharp as a knife. “Correct!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jesus ah! The Mu Ye she encountered last time was an imposter, was it? Moreover, she daydreamed that he smiled towards her. This right now was practically a slap to the face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in front of her right now was probably the true Mu Ye, just his gaze was enough to make her calves tremble. Tang Doudou gulped and moved to the side to avoid that knife-like gaze. “Ahem, what is it? There’s no harm in saying it. I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she even finished speaking, Mu Ye’s cold eyes appeared right in front of her again. Words jumped out one by one from those thin lips. “Your life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, ha, w-what are you joking about? I-it’s not funny at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually wanted her life! Then what did he save her for last time? Was he mentally ill!?</span><span style>Mu Ye’s gaze was cold and seemed completely inhuman. His eyes were deep and seemed to engulf her like a whirlpool without leaving a trace! Tang Doudou was so scared that she was stammering. Panicking, she leaned back against the tree and tried to find a safe place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My holy yoyo ah! Didn’t they agree that there wouldn’t be any life-threatening danger?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bai ah, Xiao Bai! You’ll troll me to death at this rate!</span></p>
