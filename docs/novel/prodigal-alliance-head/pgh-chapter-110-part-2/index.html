 <p><b>Chapter 110.2: Who’s the Real Demon?</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person was truly too strange. Even when the person walked out from the forest and entered the sunlight, his face still couldn’t be made out. It was like a black abyss; all light was dissolved within and nothing could be seen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Yunhuan was about to break down. His brain went blank as the aura of death leaned over and enveloped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, an extremely sharp and cold tip was pressed against his face. That object gradually swiped down. He could feel blood emerge and drip down from the places the object swept past but he couldn’t feel even the slightest pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numb. Completely numb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His entire body was numb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, just as he felt that he was about to die, that person spoke. His voice seemed to have come from the ninth hell, it was distant and bone-piercingly cold. “Remember this lesson. If there’s a next time, it won’t be as simple as just cutting apart the skin on your face… Hehe, hehehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he started laughing. As the eerie laughter gradually faded into the distance, the imposing aura receded as well like the tide. At the same time, Feng Yunhuan’s taut muscles loosened and he slid slowly towards the ground like a dead dog. Fresh blood streamed down his face and the areas where his skin was cut off revealed red and white flesh; it was a terrifying sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Feng Yunhuan could no longer feel any pain. His eyes stared lifelessly ahead, the haunting image of that face was the only thing in his head. That was the smile of a demon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord of Cloud City!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had come for revenge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Revenge for destroying Azure Water Valley!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was that really the case?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Feng Yunhuan couldn’t think much about anything. The person that had been in front of him had already disappeared as noiselessly as he had arrived. He couldn’t even tell if what he saw at that last moment was an illusion or reality…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protector Feng, what has happened to you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had laid there lifelessly for an unknown amount of time until his subordinate returned from passing on the news. When the subordinate discovered Feng Yunhuan on the ground, he hastily ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately helped Feng Yunhuan up. However, when he got a clear look at that visage, he was so terrified that he reflexively flung Feng Yunhuan away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What the hell is that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The subordinate was so scared that he was shuddering. That’s crazy, is this person Protector Feng?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t been gone for very long. How did Protector Feng end up like that!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protector Feng, is that you?” The subordinate glanced at the scorching sun above him, then gathered up his nerves to walk towards Feng Yunhuan again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart leapt like a beating drum with every step he took. It took him quite a while to finally reach Feng Yunhuan. He slowly crouched down and was just about to reach out when Feng Yunhuan abruptly sat up. Due to Feng Yunhuan’s movements, his scraped off skin slid down in one mass. Feng Yunhuan’s eyes were filled with strange red light as he looked at his subordinate resentfully.</span><span style>“Aaah! It’s a ghost!” That subordinate couldn’t take the fright. He kicked Feng Yunhuan away and scrambled frantically into the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the cries of ‘ghost’ disappeared. Only then did Feng Yunhuan retrieve his gaze dully and slowly reach up to touch his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he felt was something that was moist and sticky. Trembling, he moved his hand into his line of sight. Other than blood, there was only more blood…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He frantically wiped his face with both hands. However, when he looked at them, they were still covered with blood. The scarlet red filled his vision and caused his mental state to collapse entirely. He jumped up from the ground and screamed insanely as he ran into the forest.</span><span style>Above the rock wall Feng Yunhuan had leaned on, Su Yi had been chomping on a wild grass stalk as he watched the development below with interest. When he couldn’t see Feng Yunhuan’s figure anymore, he shrugged and muttered ‘boring’, then fell backwards to lie on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sunlight was intense as it shone straight down, flowing together with Su Yi’s wide-open eyes. However, it seemed like he didn’t feel that the light was harsh at all. Rather, it seemed as if he was challenging the sunlight in order to see who exactly was the brightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ultimately, not even that bright scorching sunlight could melt the deep darkness in his pupils and it vanished within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi started giggling. The more he laughed, the more rampantly he laughed, and the louder he laughed. It startled the birds and caused them to fly into the sky. The entire world seemed to echo with his laughter.</span><span style>The laughter was very foolish, very flamboyant, yet it contained a hard-to-describe loneliness as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A century’s loneliness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would understand?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corners of his eyes seemed a bit moist. Su Yi reached upwards with one hand. Above his head, in the misty darkness between the light and the shadow, a melodious and clear voice arose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yi, why do you like laughing so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yi, I like hearing you laugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yi, promise me that you’ll laugh more in the future, alright?”</span></p>
