 <p><b>Chapter 44: Qing Yin was Very Angry</b></p>
 <p><span style>But then Tang Doudou recalled Qing Yin’s aggrieved tone earlier and the hand she extended out immediately withdrew back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I must find a time to clear things up with her, Tang Doudou thought. But, right now, the top priority was to resolve this current matter as fast as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Xin heard what Qing Yin said, her graceful brows slightly knitted, “Qing Yin, what nonsense are you saying!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what the Masters do, it’s not their place as servants to guess their intentions. Other than consoling, it’s best for them not to be too talkative. If they provoked the Masters and caused them to be unhappy, the ones that must bear the punishment would be them, the servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These things were all things Qing Yin had said to them sisters. In the past, it was also Qing Yin who handled matters the best; that was why Baili Yu would often bring Qing Yin along when he headed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But why is it that right now, she would choose to ignore the customs?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes shifted again and her gaze landed on Tang Doudou. It must be because of Li Xueyi. It was only ever since Qing Yin started serving Li Xueyi that she became so strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Bai, this servant has something to boldly ask. Why was Miss in Snow Building?” Qing Yin ignored Qing Xin’s words and looked directly at Miss Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin was one of the most competent maids that served Baili</span><i><span style> gege</span></i><span style>. Even though her own status wasn’t normal, she still couldn’t casually offend Qing Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she immediately started weeping with soft sobs, “I-I also, it’s because I also heard that Baili </span><i><span style>gege </span></i><span style>wasn’t in Snow Building and my entire body was so dirty it felt uncomfortable, that’s why I had Qing Xin bring me over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin’s expression was unsympathetic. She had been serving Master the longest and she had long since seen so much of these kinds of schemes that she had gotten tired of them. For Qing Xin not to know was very normal; at the start she had also been muddled, she only began to slowly see through it after being exposed to it for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, the one she was worried about was Tang Doudou. Would he be deceived by this Miss Bai’s outwardly innocent appearance?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she thought about it, she glanced at Tang Doudou and saw the latter looking at Miss Bai with both eyes emitting light. It was like when a starving dog saw feces; those eyes were filled with the desire to pounce over and smack kisses until satisfied!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eh, too disgusting. Qing Yin hurriedly retrieved her thoughts. After this thought, when she looked at that Miss Bai again, she felt more and more disgusted by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she aimed her faintly angry gaze at Tang Doudou for a moment. Looks like as long as it’s a man, they wouldn’t be able to escape Miss Bai’s bewitchment ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master has never liked anyone coming to Snow Building, could it be that Miss Bai didn’t know?” She couldn’t bear to scold Tang Doudou so she could only direct her criticism towards Miss Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Bai also felt pretty depressed. In the past, no matter how much Qing Yin disliked her, she still wouldn’t directly expose her with pointed words like this. How come she insists on repeatedly pressing her today?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unless… Miss Bai’s gaze also moved towards Tang Doudou just in time to bump into Tang Doudou’s eyes which were emitting light. The frank<span style="color: #99ccff;">(explicit of sex)</span> gaze frightened her and she immediately retrieved her gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man is too frightening!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring him, Miss Bai slightly bit her cherry lips whilst her eyes turned faintly red, “I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Qing Xin couldn’t watch on anymore, “Qing Yin, I was the one who brought Miss Bai over. This morning Master said he was going to the Wind Building. And since all the other buildings were already closed by Master’s order, I could only bring Miss Bai over here to Snow Building.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s so many guest houses in the garden, all of which are ready for guests at any time. Why did you have to bring her, of all places, to Snow Building? And to even let her bathe inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…” Qing Xin couldn’t reply. Back then, she had also suggested going to a guest room but Miss Bai refused. Miss Bai had wanted to go to Snow Building, saying that there was no one inside and bathing wouldn’t take long anyways. Qing Xin thought it wouldn’t be of much importance so she agreed and brought Miss Bai over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at Qing Xin’s expression, Qing Yin was already able to surmise pretty much the whole situation. She said to Qing Xin: “As long as Miss Bai doesn’t spread this matter, I will naturally help you hide this matter and keep Master from finding out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking to here, everything was already made as clear as it could be. The only thing left was to see what Miss Bai and Qing Xin chose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one present desired for this matter to be known. Thus, when they heard Qing Yin’s suggestion they immediately went silent as they considered the pros and the cons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Bai was the very first to react. She still had on that delicate and fragile act as Qing Xin helped her up. Tightening the clothes around her body, she said: “When Li</span><i><span style> gongzi</span></i><span style> burst in I had already finished bathing. He, he didn’t see anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking, she even lowered her eyes. Her long eyelashes faintly trembled, giving off the impression that she was holding back her tears after suffering a great wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded like a chick pecking rice grains and hurriedly added, “Yes yes yes! Miss Bai is right, I didn’t see anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Qing Yin furrowed her brows and pulled Tang Doudou over, “Since it’s like that, then let’s just leave it at this. Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, don’t you still need to see Master regarding a matter? Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being reminded by Qing Yin like this, Tang Doudou immediately recalled her proper business. But when her gaze swept over Miss Bai, she paused again. From their conversation just now, it seems she had misunderstood. This Miss Bai wasn’t Baili Yu’s little pampered darling at all but actually just one of Baili Yu’s admirers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cough, then just now, weren’t her expressions of goodwill a waste of energy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just thinking about it caused her to feel upset. In the end, the best option was to traverse the honest and straight route. For now, let’s just go look for Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. Since Miss Bai is so highly principled, I also won’t act unreasonable either. While green hills change not, clear water flows long*. Let us meet again someday!” Tang Doudou grinned at Miss Bai. Even though this wasn’t Baili Yu’s pampered little darling, but she’s still full of potential ah. Perhaps one day she’ll rise up to occupy the position! </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">While the green hills remain, the fresh water will continue to flow without changing, which can signify that hatred or feelings of friendship also won’t ever change. It can also signify eternity, the world will go on for a long time so there will always be the chance to meet again. In this case, it was probably the latter meeting as she does end with a Chinese saying that’s pretty much, we’ll meet again.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>This relationship ah, has to be built well! Perhaps one day it’ll come in useful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin found the scene unpleasant to watch, so she pulled Tang Doudou and headed outside. When they got to the door, Qing Xin suddenly called out to her, “Qing Yin, Miss Bai is also looking for Master for a matter. I have to clean up here, so can I trouble you to bring Miss Bai over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin decisively wanted to refuse. To want her to go find Master together with Miss Bai? She’d rather go die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But before this sentence could even come out of her mouth, Tang Doudou, who was completely ignorant of the situation, immediately replied refreshingly: “Okay! Let’s just go together, no problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin turned furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she really had no way out. Shaking her head, she didn’t look at Tang Doudou anymore and angrily rushed downstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin, not knowing which door of moodiness Qing Yin was heading towards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Women ah, their moods are seriously hard to guess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll have to trouble Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> to wait outside for a moment. Once I finish tidying up I’ll come out to look for </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>.” Miss Bai curtsied. Her movements were graceful, warming the heart and delighting the eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before a woman heads out she does have to tidy up her appearance a bit. Tang Doudou had a rather deep understanding of this from experience, “Alright, then I’ll wait outside for you. Ahem, time’s a bit tight so remember to hurry up a little!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking, she even winked towards the person before laughing loudly with ‘haha’s and swaggering off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the room. How is this behavior like a normal man?! Tang Doudou's vulgar appearance and behavior caused Qing Xin to feel extreme disdain and despise towards him. Furthermore, she didn't know what happened to Qing Yin</span><i><span style> jie</span></i><span style>, for her to protect Tang Doudou so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Retrieving her gaze, she glanced at Miss Bai’s pitiful appearance and all the anger rose up at once, “Miss Bai, we’ve caused you to suffer grievances.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Xin, Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> is Baili </span><i><span style>gege</span></i><span style>’s guest. I’m also just doing this for Baili </span><i><span style>gege</span></i><span style>’s sake. I’m alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En.” Qing Xin supported her as she helped take off her coat and brush her hair, “Miss Bai, Qing Xin has something she doesn’t know whether she should say straight out or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Bai lowered her eyes, “Qing Xin, if there’s anything, you can just say it directly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ever since Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>came to the garden, Master has treated Li</span><i><span style> gongzi </span></i><span style>very specially. Now even Qing Yin</span><i><span style> jie</span></i><span style> is partial towards him so Miss Bai must be careful and be on guard against him!” Qing Xin repeated all the rumors in the garden, then continued, “He also seems to have a lot of tricks. Even Young Master Jun has spoken up multiple times for his sake and there’s even a rumor that Young Master Jun would go to his room every night…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Hearing this, Miss Bai couldn’t remain unperturbed anymore. The expression on her face twisted slightly, “You said Young Master Jun goes to his room every day? What does he go there to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Xin said: “What else could he do if not that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you hear this from!? How could Young Master Jun be that type of person!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s why ah, that’s why I said that Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>was especially abnormal.” Qing Xin clicked her tongue, “It is said that Qing Yin</span><i><span style> jie </span></i><span style>even walked in on the two while they were being intimate. But we also don’t know how it was handled because Young Master Jun actually spared Qing Yin </span><i><span style>jie</span></i><span style> and didn’t make her take punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, enough. These are just winds from an empty cave and not very founded on facts so you should speak of them less.” Even though Miss Bai said this, she was very envious. Back then she invested so much effort in pursuing Jun Xin, yet that guy was simply like a wooden block: insensitive to the point of blindness. He even teased her time and time again, angering her to the point her heart hurt until finally, she saw Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet now, Jun Xin actually fell in love with a man, and it’s even a man like this. Thinking to here, Miss Bai’s mood was extremely tangled. How laughable. He was the man she had fought over with so many young ladies, yet the one she had to be jealous of now was actually a man! What kind of situation was this!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she retrieved her thoughts, Qing Xin had also just finished combing her hair, “I’ll head over first. I’ll have to trouble you regarding this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Bai, don’t mention it. Hurry and go find Master. Tidying up and these kinds of matters are all duties that Qing Xin is supposed to do.” Qing Xin replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the door, Tang Doudou was looking around the area as she leaned against the railing of the building. From the corners of her eyes, she glanced at Qing Yin who was downstairs. How exactly should she explain it to Qing Yin?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Miss Bai came out, she was right in time to see the corners of Tang Doudou’s mouth tilted up and her gaze fixed frivolously towards something below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that line of sight, Miss Bai only saw Qing Yin whose appearance was as lithe and graceful as a willow tree next to the river, nothing more beautiful could be imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>has waited long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou turned around and her eyes immediately lit up. Sighing with emotion, she thought, truly a great ‘softly blooming lotus’<sup>G</sup> ah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half the hair was pulled up into coils while a large expanse of fine black hair was left to drape down from the back of her head. Wearing a pink brocade skirt, the fringes adorned with lotus leaves lightly floated with her movements and complemented her soft delicate little face. At her waist hanged a jade accessory which swayed left and right with her every movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, not long, not long. Are you done squandering time? Do you need to put on some more rouge, draw an eyebrow or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, Li </span><i><span style>gongzi.</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since it’s like this, then let’s go find your Baili </span><i><span style>gege</span></i><span style>!” Tang Doudou lifted her brow and bowed as she swept out her hand, “Miss Bai, this way please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Bai nodded and leisurely walked downstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou walked behind her. Watching Miss Bai’s little movements with her lotus steps and the way her body appeared soft like a slender willow branch in the wind, Tang Doudou couldn’t help but start to imitate her; a small step swaying one sway, a large step swaying three sways. After imitating for a while, she got way too tired. Tang Doudou wondered if Miss Bai would also feel tired from always walking this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin had good martial arts skills so her hearing was keen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had already heard the sound of the two heading down the stairs long ago, but noticing that Tang Doudou’s steps were slightly strange, she curiously looked over. That scene of Tang Doudou imitating Miss<sup>T/N</sup> Bai’s way of walking almost made her burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She helplessly retracted her gaze. Sometimes Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>truly resembled a little girl, way too naughty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Yin, let’s go!” Finally got down! Tang Doudou exhaled a breath. Da fudge, following behind Miss Bai made it so that she couldn’t even walk naturally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She dashed like a little bird to Qing Yin, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three set off together and soon reached the so-called Wind Building they talked about. Tang Doudou looked around. This place wasn’t much different from Snow Building ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She completely couldn’t understand Baili Yu’s preferences.</span></p>
