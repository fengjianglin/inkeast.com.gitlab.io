 <p><strong>Chapter 476: Split Into Three Forces</strong></p> 
 <p>Six months ago, Bai Feiyun had found him and said that he wanted to work with him to find the real Li Xueyi.</p> 
 <p>At first he hadn't agreed, but when Bai Feiyun took out a medicinal ingredient that he had been searching for for years, he agreed to the collaboration. Following that, he used Yun Hai, who he had placed at Baili Yu's side for many years and took advantage of the time that Baili Yu lost his memories to make the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce break up. Then he had his disciple, Fu Yunliu, help find young men to provide blood for the soul-devouring bugs.</p> 
 <p>Not long later, Baili Feng found him to join him in this cause. Following his orders, he acted as the mysterious person and killed all the young experts on the Jianghu to cause the martial arts community to fall into turmoil. Later, he had been planning to kill all of these people in one go in Azure Water Valley, but then something had happened on the island that caused delayed the plan. By the time he finished dealing with those matters and got back, Baili Feng had gotten caught so he had no choice but to personally show up to lure Jun Xin to North Hara City. He had planned to use Jun Xin's blood in the blood sacrifice to increase his martial arts, but Baili Yiling suddenly appeared and rescued Jun Xin so his martial arts only increased by a half.</p> 
 <p>After that, no matter what he did, for some reason he would be interrupted. Before he thought it was just bad timing, but now that he thought about it, it was probably related to Bai Feiyun. He had actually been tricked by Bai Feiyun!</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun was the only one that he had told about the weakness of the soul-devouring bugs. There was no way anyone other than Bai Feiyun could’ve been able to drive away the soul-devouring bugs! </p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun! Bai Feiyun! Bai Feiyun!</p> 
 <p>Lan Jia cursed Bai Feiyun's name with vehement hatred. When it occurred to him that if it hadn't been for Bai Feiyun's interference, he may have already united the martial arts community, that he would've already achieved his dream of creating an immortality pill from using the saint blood of the Seven Great Saint Tribes, he become furious.</p> 
 <p>It was all Bai Feiyun's fault!</p> 
 <p>He angrily smashed several more walls, then with a flash, he headed outside North Hara City.</p> 
 <p>Only a short while had passed, so the people couldn't have gone far. He'd be able to catch up with them soon, then…</p> 
 <p>Lan Jia's guess was correct. If it had just been the four large clans and the people of the martial arts alliance, they would've already gotten very far away. However, in front of them was the citizens of an entire city. With several thousand people in front of them, the speed would obviously be slow.</p> 
 <p>Bai Luoqing revealed her anxiousness. "Going on like this isn't a solution. We have to split off from these citizens!"</p> 
 <p>"That's right. If things keep dragging on like this, none of us will be able to leave!" said Stronghold Master Lin.</p> 
 <p>Everyone understood this, but how could it possibly be easy to shake off these citizens?</p> 
 <p>Ever since these citizens found out that they were the ones that saved them from the soul-devouring bugs, they started following them closely like they were gripping on the last rope of hope. No matter what they said, the citizens weren't willing to leave.</p> 
 <p>At this time, City Lord Xu walked over with an anxious expression. He was also worried over this question. However, what he was thinking was that if the martial artists left, Lan Jia would definitely go follow them first and wouldn't trouble the citizens, so they might even be able to head back to the city.</p> 
 <p>"Sirs and heros, this official believes that going on like this won't be a solution. It's best if we split up so that Lan Jia can't go after everyone. That way more people will be able to escape!"</p> 
 <p>"City Lord Xu, we were thinking the same thing, but…" Bai Luoqing looked towards the unending line of humans and sighed. "I'm afraid they won't agree!"</p> 
 <p>Although they were ordinary people without martial arts, there were a lot of them. If they got violent, their small group wouldn't be able to fend them off!</p> 
 <p>When City Lord Xu saw that they also shared the intention of leaving separately, he was internally overjoyed. However, he didn't let it show and just vowed, "Don't worry, I'll definitely persuade them!"</p> 
 <p>Bai Luoqing smiled without saying anything else and headed over to find Elder Yu.</p> 
 <p>Both sides happened to have the same idea and decided to go off separately so that Lan Jia couldn't go after all of them. </p> 
 <p>Everything was quickly settled. The four large clans would head south and return to their clans while the martial arts alliance would head southwest to Huai City in order to discuss who would become the next martial arts alliance head.</p> 
 <p>The news that Tang Doudou had fallen off a cliff caused a gloomy air to hang around the people of the martial arts alliance. They didn't know who the next alliance head would be. Would it be someone sent by Cloud City or someone that they chose themselves?</p> 
 <p>However, who could successfully lead the martial arts alliance as of now with the situation so dire?</p> 
 <p>The group split into two as planned, but they ended up both bumping into people.</p> 
 <p>When Elder Yu, who was leading the way on horseback for the group that was heading southwest through the winding mountain roads saw Lan Jia, he almost fell off his horse from shock.</p> 
 <p>The other group ran into the chrysanthemum glass jade palanquin that had already been waiting ahead for them for a long time. The family heads never expected for Baili Yu to be waiting here for them. After discussing things, the family heads went to rest so that Xiao Siyuan and Baili Yu could discuss things.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Siyuan was a little unwilling, but he couldn't take Xiao Qian's gaze that was full of expectation. He finally cupped his fist towards the seniors, then went with Xiao Yi who had just woken up recently to walk towards the chrysanthemum glass jade palanquin.</p> 
 <p>When Lin Shuxuan saw this, his eyes whirled and he looked towards his dad. Although Stronghold Master Lin wasn't looking at him, he knew what Lin Shuxuan was thinking based on his fervent gaze. "You can head over too. If there's something you can help with, help out!"</p> 
 <p>Lin Shuxuan agreed excitedly and squeezed his way out of the crowd to follow them.</p> 
 <p>When he got over there, Xiao Siyuan was already talking with Baili Yu.</p> 
 <p>"We still have to ask Grandpa about this." When Lin Shuxuan got close, it was just in time to heard Xiao Siyuan say this gravely.</p> 
 <p>He was confused what matter would still require Xiao Qian's permission. The family heads had clearly given Xiao Siyuan the power to make decisions for them earlier.</p> 
 <p>After a moment, Baili Yu's laughter drifted out from the palanquin. "Xiao <em>gongzi</em> can't even make the decisions for your own matters?"</p> 
 <p>"Siyuan can make the decision for most matters, but this matter must be discussed with Grandpa," replied Xiao Siyuan unhurriedly.</p> 
 <p>His calm voice contained an unquestionable firmness.</p> 
 <p>Baili Yu didn't react much and just smiled. "Then I'll wait for Xiao <em>gongzi</em>'s reply."</p> 
 <p>Xiao Siyuan smiled faintly, then changed the topic. "May I ask what Baili <em>gongzi</em> thinks about the matter regarding Alliance Head?"<br> Perhaps it was because Baili Yu hadn't expected this question because he was silent for a while before he said with a smile, "If Xiao <em>gongzi</em> is this worried about Doudou, why not just come with me to search for her?"</p> 
 <p>"Baili <em>gongzi</em> is misunderstanding. That's not what Siyuan means. It's just that Siyuan heard Elder Yu say earlier that the alliance head command tablet could be used against Lan Jia, so I wanted to ask which cliff Alliance Head fell off of and whether it was possible to search the area for the alliance head command tablet." Although Baili Yu's tone was unreadable as always, no man would want another man to be thinking of his woman, so Xiao Siyuan hastily explained himself.</p> 
 <p>Baili Yu just continued smiling. "I've personally checked the bottom of the cliff. There were no traces of Doudou but I did find the alliance head command tablet. It's just that…"</p> 
 <p>He paused slightly. "The alliance head command tablet has already shattered. I'm afraid it can't be used anymore."</p> 
 <p>"It shattered?" Xiao Siyuan was stunned, then he sighed with regret and bowed towards Baili Yu. "If there's nothing else, Siyuan will withdraw first!"</p> 
 <p>After saying that, he turned around and left. He didn't even greet Xiao Yi or Lin Shuxuan and headed straight towards the four large clans' procession to arrange for the disciples to start traveling again. Since they had been concerned about the family heads' injuries, he had arranged for a couple carriages before leaving the city. Once the procession started moving again and passed by Baili Yu's chrysanthemum glass jade palanquin, Xiao Siyuan who was now sitting on the Xiao family's carriage said, "Grandpa, as expected, Baili Yu wanted to recruit me."</p> 
 <p>He spoke extremely quietly so that only Xiao Qian who was sitting across from him could hear.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Qian didn't open his eyes and just nodded. After a long while, he asked, "Siyuan, what do you think?"</p> 
 <p>"This grandson wants to accept this offer." Xiao Siyuan got straight to the point. He glanced outside the window whose curtain had been lifted by the wind at the yellow withered leaves outside as a trace of cold light flashed through his gentle eyes.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Qian nodded. "Since you've already decided, then just do as you wish."</p> 
 <p>"Grandpa…"</p> 
 <p>"I've gotten old." Xiao Qian opened his eyes and heaved a sigh. His muddy old eyes looked towards Xiao Siyuan with affection. "From now on, the Xiao family will be relying on you and Xiao Yi."</p> 
 <p>Xiao Siyuan felt sad seeing how tired and fragile Grandpa seemed. He glanced outside again and his throat moved several times silent before he finally forced out this question. "Back then, the person that killed my parents, was it really Baili Yu?"</p> 
 <p>Xiao Qian's expression of affection immediately changed when he heard this, but almost instantly it was replaced by an expression of sorrow. "Siyuan ah, you still can't let go of that hatred?"</p> 
 <p>Xiao Siyuan was silent for a while, but his eyes were resolute when he looked back up. "Having killed my father, we are enemies that cannot live under the same sky!"</p> 
 <p>As this hatred-filled statement left Xiao Siyuan's mouth, there was no trace of his usual gentleness. On the contrary, his voice was extremely cold.</p> 
 <p>A trace of cold light also flashed through Xiao Qian's eyes when he saw Xiao Siyuan's hatred-filled expression. He sighed. "If I knew earlier that you would become like this due to hatred, I wouldn't have told you about this back then."</p> 
 <p>Xiao Siyuan didn't speak and just sat there silently for a while before saying, "Grandpa, I'm going to look for Baili Yu now. For the rest of the way, have Xiao Yi accompany you!"</p> 
 <p>"Siyuan." Xiao Qian seemed to want to dissuade him.</p> 
 <p>However, Xiao Siyuan smiled towards him in his usual manner. "Grandpa, Siyuan has already grown up and knows what should and should not be done. Siyuan won't make any rash moves, so don't worry!"</p> 
 <p>After saying that, he said warmly, "Grandpa, take care of yourself!"</p> 
 <p>"Haa, go. I'll take care of this old batch of bones and wait for you to come back to help Ah Yi manage the Xiao family." Xiao Qian sighed again and waved weakly like he couldn't do anything about Xiao Siyuan.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Siyuan smiled, then turned and jumped off the carriage.</p> 
 <p>The moment he left the carriage, Xiao Qian's expression changed completely. It became cold and grim. His voice also lowered. "You still haven't found that brat?"</p> 
 <p>He was clearly the only one in the carriage, so who was he asking?</p> 
 <p>Right after he said that, a vexed voice came from below the carriage. "Originally I wanted to kill that guy, but Nangong Yan, that wretch had actually put soul-dispersing powder on that kid so I couldn't approach."</p>
