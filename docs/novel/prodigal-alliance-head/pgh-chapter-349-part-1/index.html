 <p><b>Chapter 349.1: Scheme to Lure the Tiger Away From its Den</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou arrived at the foot of Dream Mountain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She gazed up at the white mist that concealed the top of Dream Mountain. It was so foggy that the path up was vague, just like her past journey had been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The inn at the foot of the mountain was now uninhabited. Tang Doudou tied the horse up near the inn and started heading up Dream Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She went by what she could remember of the path that Mu Ye had led her on and soon got to the bamboo forest. The peach tree was still there like before, the tombs were also undisturbed. Everything was just as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She frowned. For some reason, the stillness of this place felt off. What exactly was going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she wondered this, she started heading towards the bamboo house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as she had expected. There was no trace of Mu Ye. She searched through the entire house and found that the large chest with the Swayflower was also gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that there was some unexpected change in circumstance which forced Mu Ye to take the chest with him and leave?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Nan Maner didn't find Mu Ye on Dream Mountain, why didn't she go back to Green Maple City to tell her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And what did Yun Hai tell her to come to Dream Mountain for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much she thought about these things, she couldn't figure out any answers. She was also completely lost as to what to do next. She couldn't help but laugh self-mockingly. Perhaps Yun Hai was just joking with her and left that message to make her take a pointless trip to Dream Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wait!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her facial expression changed drastically. As if Yun Hai would waste time messing around with her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had clearly been using the tactic of luring a tiger away from its domain in the mountains!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was not good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When this possibility occured to Tang Doudou, she hastily rushed back to the foot of the mountain, but the horse that she had tied up near the inn was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Crap!" Tang Doudou covered her face and stomped in helpless irritation. She started running towards Green Maple City, but after a while, suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was definitely too late now to get back to Green Maple City, and she might even fall into a trap Yun Hai set up for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced in the opposite direction, in the direction of Huai City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze turned resolved and she started heading towards Huai City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was too late to go back to Green Maple City, it would be better to head to Huai City to discuss further plans with Jun Xin. The more people, the more power. It would be harder for her to deal with Yun Hai on her own, and she would eventually have to go back to Huai City anyways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this trip didn't go that smoothly. First, black-robed men almost saw through her human skin mask, then she encountered Elder Yu. However, at that time, he seemed troubled and distracted. It was probably because Bai Feiyun had gained influence in the Alliance Head Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite it all, she managed to make it safely to Huai City. However, the city gates were filled with a long line of people since every person had to be inspected meticulously before they were allowed to enter the city. Even young girls that had not been married were not spared the inspection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw this from a distance, she didn't dare to walk up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stopped beneath a tree to think about her options, then decided to come back and check the situation at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just a pity that she had given the bamboo flute to Nan Maner. Otherwise, she probably could've called Jun Xin out by playing the flute! Oh, she forgot. One, she didn't know how to play a flute and two, even if she knew, Jun Xin might not hear it and if he did, he wouldn't know it was her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, Tang Doudou became even more depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she looked towards the seemingly endless line in front of the Huai City entrance, she became even more depressed. She couldn't help but wonder if Yun Hai's goal had been to force her back to Huai City from the start.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After resting for a while more, she looked around Huai City and found an old temple to rest in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she got to the temple, she felt pain from her stomach and attributed it to the fact that she had used inner strength to travel. She pressed softly on her stomach as she entered the temple. The temple was damp, so she pulled the red sash off the Buddha statue and placed it on the straw before sitting down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Maner had taught her a couple lines of a chant to revolve her inner strength when her stomach hurt to ease the pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After revolving her inner strength in that way a couple times, her pain did ease quite a lot. Then she started making preparations for sneaking into Huai City.</span></p>
