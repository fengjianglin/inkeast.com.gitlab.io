 <p><b>Chapter 131.2: Is Your Mouth Still Ok?</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Doudou. This is the place where prisoners are kept.” Xiao Dao’s voice interrupted Tang Doudou’s train of thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very dark. Tang Doudou couldn’t even see where Xiao Dao was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you give me some light?” Tang Doudou really wanted to knuckle rap Xiao Dao again. Was this kid a natural airhead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Dao gave a dejected ‘oh,’ then took out a rolled torch to light the lamps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire room gradually became illuminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huh? There actually wasn’t much to be scared of!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weren’t those just the torture instruments often shown in TV dramas? There was nothing particularly grotesque or novel, what a disappointment ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Dao? What about the people imprisoned here?” Tang Doudou looked around and discovered that there was not a single person here. Where was Skinny?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Dao replied, “Master has never placed much importance on this branch so these have never been used.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This branch isn’t valued?” Mist City was a nightless city and it was flourishing even better than Huai City. As an authentic businessman, how could Baili Yu not value this piece of fat meat?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made no sense!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, Xiao Dao, have you always been in Mist City?” She recalled that when Baili Yu was heading over, Ye Chuan had only arranged for those maids to go with him. She didn’t know if he had arranged for any guards to go in secret as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Dao nodded. “That’s right. Back then, I was sent here to be the person in charge at this branch. It has probably been about five years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five years. That doesn’t count as short.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Dao didn’t look older than eighteen. If it had been five years, then back then wouldn’t he have been around twelve or thirteen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>To become the person in charge of such a large branch at that age, Baili Yu was exploiting child labor ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this meant that Xiao Dao probably had a lot of skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So why did he become a hidden guard?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Doudou, if there are no other matters, then we should head out. It’s not good for girls to look at these things.” Xiao Dao couldn’t stop himself from saying this when he saw Tang Doudou lost in thought as she leaned next to the torture instruments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Tang Doudou wasn’t afraid of these things, being underground was a little stifling. Hence, she nodded in agreement. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right as they stepped out of the basement, a figure ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Xiao Dao, I’ve finally found you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, Master is looking for you!” The person who had arrived was the hidden guard that usually stayed by Baili Yu’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu? Before Xiao Dao could even reply, Tang Doudou interjected, “It was Baili Yu that send you to find Xiao Dao? Did he call for me to go over there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did the hidden guard notice her presence. He hastily bowed and said, “Greetings, Lady Doudou.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough wasting words. Did Baili Yu ask for me to go over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hidden guard displayed a troubled expression. “Master only called for Boss Xiao Dao to head over, he didn’t say to find Lady Doudou.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then where is he right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“City Lord Residence!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so, Xiao Dao was brought away just like this and Tang Doudou was left by herself in the large courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So he’s gone to the City Lord Residence. No wonder he brought so many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt relieved now that she found out Baili Yu was off dealing with business and was not in danger. Since she had nothing else to do, she decided to take out the things Cang Baicao gave her for curing the Hoarfrost Poison and look through them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was afflicted with an incurable poison. Despite the fact that the poison had never flared up, she still lost sleep due to worrying about it. Baili Yu’s poison often flared up so it was definitely even more unpleasant for him. If she could help cure his poison sooner, she’d feel more relieved and perhaps he might even help cure her poison once he got better. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou could understand why Baili Yu kept putting off the matter of helping cure her poison. It was likely because her poison wasn’t easy to cure and on top of that, Baili Yu didn’t have medical expertise. It’s said that when he cured himself of the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance back then, it was completely due to good luck. Even so, it was a very narrow escape. Hence, it probably wasn’t that he didn’t want to help her cure the poison but more that he wasn’t completely confident he could do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at the things inside the box. The most eye-catching item was an old, faint yellow booklet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alright, this was probably the manual?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou took out the booklet and carefully put the other things back inside before flipping open the booklet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After flipping through a few pages, black lines appeared over Tang Doudou’s forehead. Da fudge, what was all this!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this a troll!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did that old thing, Cang Baicao, give her the wrong thing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da f*ck? What exactly was with this ‘little yellow rabbit’-like booklet? &nbsp;<span style="color: #3366ff">(yellow = porn. Tu4 = rabbit. Tu2 = drawing. Semi-homophone of graphic porn)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Speechless, she threw it to the side. Tang Doudou felt an incomparable headache coming on. Truly, not a single person from Cloud City could be relied on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon afterwards, she began worrying again. Where was she supposed to go to find Cang Baicao so that he would teach her the real method to cure the poison?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Doudou, are you here?” Right at this moment, the sound of Qing He knocking came from outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stuffed the ‘little yellow rabbit’ into her chest and jumped off the bed. “I’m here. What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this familiar yet loathsome voice, Qing He’s eyes darkened for a moment before returning to normal. She then continued, “Lady Doudou, a </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> called Su Yi came to the Chamber of Commerce and said he was looking for you due to a very important matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speak of the devil ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi and Cang Baicao were both people from Cloud City. If she couldn’t find Cang Baicao, finding Su Yi was good enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rushed over and opened the door happily. Instantly noticing that Qing He’s arm was wrapped with white bandages, she asked, “You got injured?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Doudou had better hurry and go. That </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> seemed to be very worried.” Qing He avoided Tang Doudou’s worried gaze and replied mildly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be that Qing He was holding a grudge against her, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. Forget it. From the looks of it, the injury had already been treated so it’d probably be fine. She had better go find Su Yi first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I’m going now!” After waving to Qing He, Tang Doudou headed towards the anteroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after she walked in, she saw Su Yi sitting at the entrance of the Chamber of Commerce, his appearance completely wretched as he panted heavily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something’s not right ah. He looks terrible. It couldn’t be that he was here to ask her for help?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking about it a moment, Tang Doudou straightened out her clothes, then slowly walked towards Su Yi. “No wonder I heard magpies calling outside the window this morning, so it turns out that a honored guest has come to visit ah! Brother Su, long time no see, is your mouth still ok?”</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">[Chiyomira's Corner]</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">Hehe, I'm grateful to all the people in my life and I feel extremely blessed to have such a supportive family and to have encountered so many kind people in my life. I'm also grateful to all my editors and proofreaders who help me out despite the crazy deadlines I give. And of course, I'm super grateful to you readers who have supported me all this way. I literally have a 'eeek!! This part is so great!! But, I have to translate 5 chps to get to this... 20 hours... urgh..." relationship with PAH and if it weren't for Dray's 'nudging' and all your support, I definitely wouldn't be able to keep going at such a steady pace. I also want to thank the readers of all the series I put on hiatus. I was completely prepared for negative comments but instead, all I received were considerate and encouraging comments. Having such a kind audience really does motivate me to keep staying in the translating community so I'm very very grateful!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff"> Happy Thanksgiving!!&nbsp;☆*･゜ﾟ･*(^O^)/*･゜ﾟ･*☆</span></p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">Speaking of which, volare has an especially awesome and considerate audience! And also speaking of which, volareversary is on the 15th! Originally I was thinking of doing a multiple choice event for Christmas but I'm thinking of switching to a different event (still very easy) for celebrating volare's anniversary... I have the basic idea already, I just need to finalize the details so keep an eye out for the first post on Mon with the details! Of course, the link also be posted at the end of the chapter like usual.</span></p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">Back to end of chapter comments, in regards to, “is your mouth still ok?” I don’t know what it means either. When I searched it up though, the first results that popped up is ‘your mouth is still very pin2’ which means the person being addressed likes to talk a lot about useless stuff/crack jokes. I don’t know if it’s related, but I’m putting it here since the first time Su Yi showed up, he was kinda a goof.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #0000ff">D: I'd agree, he probably talks too much.</span></p>
