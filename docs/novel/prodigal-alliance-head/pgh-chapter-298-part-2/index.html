 <p><b>Chapter 298.2: Big Brother was Dead</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was certain Jun Xin wouldn't try to spy again this time, so he bent over and spoke softly into Tang Doudou's ear. "Alliance Head, can you hear me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no response visible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun inserted a few more needles. Tang Doudou's brows furrowed from pain, but her eyes remained dull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head?" Only then did Bai Feiyun realize that something was wrong. He had lied to Jun Xin earlier, he had already undid the seal. It was just that he needed to ask Tang Doudou something, that's why he lied to get Jun Xin away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, although Tang Doudou had opened her eyes, she was still unconscious. The way she looked was as if she had lost her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lost her soul?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun's expression turned serious. He tapped a few more of her pressure points, then collected the needles and left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jun Xin saw him come out, he hastily ran over. "Is she awake?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun shook his head. Jun Xin's heart started pounding anxiously when he saw the grave expression on Bai Feiyun's face. "She's not awake? Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I've undone her seal and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her body, it seems like she's the one who's unwilling to wake up." As he spoke, he glanced at Jun Xin. "Young Master Jun, has the Alliance Head encountered something traumatizing?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't know." Jun Xin had a bad premonition that was getting stronger. "But someone else does!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said that, he ran off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun had no choice but to return to the room. He looked Tang Doudou over again. Her body was fine, it was clearly a mental problem. Although her body was alert, she was still unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin soon returned with a cursing lady in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Baili Yiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Damned brat! Let go of me! I'll bite you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're hurting me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up!" Jun Xin's expression was completely dark. He was extremely worried and vexed since Tang Doudou wasn't waking up. If it hadn't been for the fact that Baili Yiling was the only one who knew what happened to her, he would have already killed this annoying and noisy woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Master Jun, this is?" Bai Feiyun looked at Baili Yiling who was still dressed in ragged clothing. However, when he saw her eyes, he had an inkling of who she was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Baili Yiling, Baili Yu's younger sister!" Jun Xin gave a simple explanation, then pulled Baili Yiling to Tang Doudou's bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up already and take a look for yourself!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling flung off Jun Xin's hand and turned to glance at Tang Doudou. When she saw Tang Doudou's lifeless eyes, she cried out in shock, "Sister-in-Law! What's wrong?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she saw Bai Feiyun who was standing by the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw that he was dressed in white with handsome and gentle features, she asked, "You're Bai Feiyun?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun nodded. "Yes."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"City Lord Su told me that you would be able to wake Sister-in-Law up."</span><span style>"I've already done all I can, it's the Alliance Head that's not willing to wake up," said Bai Feiyun as he looked towards Baili Yiling. "That's why I wanted to find out what exactly Alliance Head had encountered, to cause her to be unwilling to wake up. The reason must be found before we can start coming up with ideas to convince her to wake up."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Master Jun is simply too worried about Alliance Head, that's why he was a little rough with you. I hope Lady won't blame him too much and will tell us about what happened to you and Alliance Head during this past period."</span><span style>Baili Yiling glanced at Jun Xin. She had known that something was wrong with Sister-in-Law when she saw how impatient he was, but she hadn't expected it to be so severe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course she knew why Sister-in-Law wasn't willing to wake up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was definitely that Brother's death caused her to lose the will to live. Since she had no will to live, she naturally wouldn't wake up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person as gentle and considerate as Bai Feiyun was much more pleasing to the eye than Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A lot of things had happened. I think Sister-in-Law isn't willing to wake up because Big Brother's death had dealt her too large of a blow..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stinkin' girl! What nonsense are you saying!" Before she could even finish her sentence, Jun Xin started shouting.</span></p>
