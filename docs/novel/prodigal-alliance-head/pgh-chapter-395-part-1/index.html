 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 395.1: Was There Any Use? </strong></u></span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did she mean by revival pill? What did she mean by that Jun Xin would die for sure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Jun Xin himself had said, he looked perfectly fine. How could he possibly die?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this was what Tang Doudou was thinking, she still didn't dare to feed the pill to Little Gray because what if?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if Grandma Shen's words were true? Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grandma, can you explain? I don't really understand." She put away the pill and asked Grandma Shen to clear things up despite Jun Xin's urging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn't understand the Grandma Shen of the past. Although she still didn't understand Grandma Shen now, her intuition told her that Grandma Shen was telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she needed to know the details.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jun Xin saw that she planned to get to the bottom of this, he immediately became flustered. "Stinkin' woman, who exactly do you trust?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course I trust you!" Tang Doudou had no hesitation, but then she continued, "However, I'm also willing to believe Grandma's words because I can't let Little Gray die, but even more so, I can't let anything happen to you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was stunned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She said that she couldn't let anything happen to him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her stubborn little face was currently lifted and those pure sparkling eyes that had always captivated him so were currently looking right at him. Even if he knew that she had no romantic feelings towards him and only cared about him as a friend, he was still so touched that he was a mess. The reluctance to leave her became stronger. When he thought of the fact that he would never be able to see her again after he died, it tormented him way more then the thought of dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tell the truth!" When Tang Doudou saw the flickering light in Jun Xin's eyes, she understood that Grandma Shen had been telling the truth. There was something wrong with Jun Xin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin looked down. "I… What do you want me to say? It's true, I don't have much time left. There's only an hour… after an hour, I'll die. There's only one revival pill. Between Little Gray and I, who are you going to choose?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>His tone was soft, calm, and indifferent. The way he simply stated his end caused Tang Doudou's eyes to dim. How was she supposed to choose?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she had said earlier, she couldn't just stand by and watch as Jun Xin died. It was the same for Little Gray. If she had to choose, then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The revival pill can revive someone after death. If he's fed the revival pill immediately a few moments after his death, he'll be revived. Meanwhile, this monkey is near death. Although eating the revival pill can extend its life, it won't heal the injury. There is still a need to treat the injury, so you should leave this pill for that kid!" Just as Tang Doudou was struggling with these thoughts, Grandma Shen spoke and revealed the effect of the revival pill so that Tang Doudou could make the best decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing this, Tang Doudou placed the pill back into the vial and put it away carefully in her chest before turning towards Grandma Shen earnestly. "Grandma, will you still help me cure Little Gray?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're the only one that can save him. This grandma is just supplying you with a method. My words are the same as before, after you've thought things through, give me an answer. Essence blood and life source are very important things. It may directly affect your health and life span."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou bit her lips, then asked, "Those things aren't important. What I want to know is, will losing my essence blood and sharing my life source affect the child in my body?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandma Shen was shocked. "You're pregnant?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En!" Tang Doudou looked at her nervously. "Will there be an issue?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There will be, there's a huge issue!" Grandma Shen sighed. "This poor little thing. It seems that the Heavens just won't allow it to live!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grandma!" Tang Doudou walked up anxiously and grabbed Grandma Shen's sleeve. "Isn't there any other way?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let me think." Grandma Shen pushed away her hand and leaned on the clutch as she paced around the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin had wandered over to Tang Doudou's side and now he asked, "Stinkin' woman, will you be sad if I died?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What the heck are you saying? Isn't there a revival pill here?" Tang Doudou glowered at him. But when she saw those unbridled lackadaisical eyes, her heart suddenly filled with panic and fear to the point she could barely breathe. If he didn't have the revival pill, then an hour later… He would really die?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She abruptly grabbed Jun Xin's hands. "I'm warning you, you can't die, got it!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin lifted his eyes to meet her worried gaze. All those little events of the past seemed to flash through his eyes. The deer meat that he had been waiting for half the day had gone all into her stomach. Later, she made spicy strips for him as an apology, but he ended up being beaten by Meng Ru when he got distracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She got her hand injured while defending Qing Yin and fell into the pond due to his words. Then Baili Yu rescued her and she puked water all over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the room, her upper body was unclothed and like that of a male's as she teased him, then they fell over each other and he found out that she was a woman. Afterwards, he got into the habit of guarding her every night until she fell asleep and these emotions gradually filled his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later, she got involved with Baili Yu and even spent a night with him in Plum Garden, which tore his heart apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The later events also emerged in his mind. It was only now that Jun Xin realized that the time from since he met her to until he fully fell in love with her had been only a year. It was a short year, but it actually made him feel like it had been forever. As if many years ago, he had already fallen in love with her, that he had never forgotten her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lingering passion that abruptly appeared in Jun Xin's eyes made Tang Doudou flustered and she hastily looked away. "You're my best friend. If anything happened to you because of me, I'll be really hurt."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Friend? Best friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he had always known that this would be her answer, he still couldn't help but feel disappointed. He turned to look outside the window at the setting sun. When he looked back, his eyes were unconcerned as always and he laughed lightly. "Scourges cause calamity for a thousand years! Don't worry, this little master wouldn't die that easily!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, he jumped onto the balcony and leaned back with his arms pillowing his head. He even pulled out a tanghulu from somewhere and started munching on it.</span></p>
