 <p><b>Chapter 321.1: Self-directed Act</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, alright, I'll start right away, right away..." Qing Cheng was worried that Tang Longbiao would make another scene so he hastily returned to the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even while Tang Doudou was acting angry, she kept her gaze on Baili Yu. At this time, she winked at him smugly as if asking for praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Baili Yu possibly maintain that cool and aloof manner when she was acting so cute? His eyes softened and he curled his lips in an indulgent smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those outstanding looks of his were captivating enough on their own, but when he smiled and released such a indolent seductive aura, it instantly sucked away the audiences' souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Qing Cheng was stunned. Escort Xue had been in Wind Cherishing House for almost three months, but he had never seen him smile. However, the owner had once warned him that Escort Xue was a seductive devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had guessed that Escort Xue would be captivating if he smiled, but he had never expected it to be this captivating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw the people around her fall into a daze, she instantly realized that she had done something stupid again. Why the heck had she winked at Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't like she had glaucoma or cataracts! </span></p>
 <p><span style>She covered her forehead as she tried to think of a solution. Then she shouted, "Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, are you going to start the auction or not!? If you're not, I'm leaving now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice resounded loudly in the hall and jolted Qing Cheng back to his senses. He glanced apologetically at the audience only to find that most of them were still in a daze. Thus, he shot a look towards the courtesans behind the stage. As lively music rang out, the main hall revived again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng said a few more words to stroke the atmosphere, then proclaimed the start of the auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rule of brothels was that the one who paid the highest price ultimately got the courtesan, thus the hall filled with people shouting prices the moment the auction started. Due to Baili Yu's earlier smile, the prices were abnormally high. Every time Qing Cheng heard another person top the going price, his smile would deepen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wanted to shout a price, so she kicked Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s butt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was currently stunned by the prices that were being shouted. He had never seen a courtesan go for so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's sudden kick made his eyes well up with tears of pain. He looked to her in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shout a price!" Tang Doudou glowered at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> immediately understood. When he heard someone call five hundred taels, he didn't know how much to call so he turned around to ask Tang Doudou. However, the moment he turned around, he was glared at. Thus, he thought that since Tang Longbiao was rich, it'd be better to shout out a large increase rather than waste time increasing the price bit by bit. He opened his mouth to shout the price he had come up with. "E-e-eight..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> in surprise. Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> glanced towards her as well, but still couldn't understand what she was trying to say. Thus, he shouted, "Eight thousand taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire hall fell silent to the point the sound of the wind could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's face turned pitch black. Why did she end up with an idiot helping her call out the price?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wouldn't be able to get this much money even if she sold herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took quite a while for Qing Cheng to recover from his astonishment. "Lian, Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, stop messing around."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> glanced towards Tang Doudou, feeling wronged. "Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, I'm not messing around. It's Master Tang that told me to help him call out a price."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng's gaze then shifted towards Tang Doudou. Even Master Wang looked over with schadenfreude. He could barely stop himself from shouting, if you don't have money, then scram!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Tang Doudou looked towards Baili Yu as she smoothed her hair. Use eight thousand taels to bring home an evil spirit...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was worth it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, this price is my intention." Inwardly, Tang Doudou's heart was bleeding. She wasn't even in the mood to look at Baili Yu anymore. She was trying to figure out how to hurry up and escape with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahem, Tang </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>'s bid is eight thousand taels. If there's no one willing to pay a higher price, Escort Xue will go to Tang </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Wang, who had been hoping to catch a good show, unhappily retrieved his gaze. Then he peeked at Tang Doudou again. Who exactly was this person? That was eight thousand taels ah! But he didn't even blink when spending it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Wang had no idea that Tang Doudou's heart was currently dripping blood as she restrained her urge to send Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> flying with a kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir, did I make a mistake?" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> looked towards Tang Doudou timidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was she supposed to say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she had already decided to give up on paying and just run away with Baili Yu, the price didn't matter. The important point was that after this price was called, there was no more competition!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So now that she thought about it, it had been a pretty good move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eight thousand taels were enough to buy Escort Xue in his entirety with money left over, to spend this one just a courtesan's first night was unthinkable. Thus, after this price was called, no one else in the hall made a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng repeated his previous statement two more times, but still, no one said anything. Tang Doudou relaxed and nudged Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> who was kneeling next to her. She whispered, "It was right, nicely done."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er </span></i><span style>blushed happily. "Many thanks for Sir's praise. In the future, I'll do even better!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inwardly, he was very excited. His guess had been right! This guest was definitely super wealthy. That was eight thousand taels after all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had second guessed his decision countless times before he had shouted that price. Luckily he had made the right bet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There would be a future? Tang Doudou glanced mildly at Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> as she rubbed her chin. Although this courtesan looked naive and pitiful, it turned out that he was actually quite crafty and greedy... This could be exploited.</span></p>
