 <p><b>Chapter 22: Unusually High Acting Skill</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But who is Tang Doudou?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just beaten Elder Yu, what does she have to fear from these little fishes that can't even compare to Elder Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, then your meaning is that you want to have a long intimate talk with all our knees pressed closed?" Tang Doudou found a seat and sat down. Glancing at that shattered plate of snacks on the floor, she didn't know how long Bai Feiyun could obstruct Xiao Yiyun. She must resolve this in the shortest time possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>From far away, Elder Yu heard this and the color of his pupils darkened. This crowd of matters-wrecking rubbish!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet he also couldn't really turn the conversation over. The current Li Xueyi was like a mad dog, whoever he caught he would bite. Currently, it was still not the time to completely shed all pretense of cordiality with him. This plan did not succeed, he almost must return to properly redeliberate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Xiao Yiyun still hasn't returned after a long while and recalling Bai Feiyun's strange skill, Elder Yu guessed that Xiao Yiyun had already been obstructed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu had been angered a lot, but calmed down quite a bit. Even though the great power before his eyes was lost, in reality it wasn't a huge loss to him. On the contrary, because of this incident, the secret chess pieces that he had arranged would be even steadier. He just had to wait for the right opportunity, then he could thoroughly take control of Cloud City...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He blew away the tea suds floating in the water. As for Li Xueyi, he’s just a little energetic clown. What harm was there in letting him play around a little longer?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>At most it'd just be a bit irksome.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head empathizes with everyone, everyone must also empathize with Alliance Head ah! Fighting hand to hand with that devil isn't easy ah. Although the Alliance Head described it as breezily as a feather, that was just so that everyone wouldn't worry. How can you guys be so insensible, forcing the Alliance Head to talk so much. If you guys really cause the Alliance Head to become exhausted, I'd like to see how you guys plan to explain it to the City Lord!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this suddenly come from Elder Yu, everyone froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did this Elder Yu go crazy from being angered by the Alliance Head? He's actually thinking of the Alliance Head and putting himself in his shoes?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeming to know what they were thinking in their hearts, Elder Yu candidly laughed heartily. Walking over, he said: "As everyone knows, I, this Yu, has straightforward intestines. Before when I made things hard for the Alliance Head, it was simply because my brain was stupid and believed the rumors in the Jianghu and thought that the Alliance Head's character was not good so he was not suitable to sit in this position. But from the looks of it, Alliance Head, you're a very straightforward person that speaks in a refreshingly straightforward manner. Your devotion to righteousness inspires admiration as a youngster with ambition... What part of you is as intolerable as the rumors say ah?! Sure enough, rumors cannot be trusted, yet this elm wood brain of mine only came to understand this now! There is no one more suitable than you, Xueyi, to sit in this Alliance Head position!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope Alliance Head you, as a great person would be magnanimous and won't keep this Yu's former enmity in mind and devote your all together with this Yu to these Martial Arts Circles!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This stream of words was presented in such a way that Tang Doudou was shocked beyond shocked. Da fudge, she, Tang Doudou has gained knowledge and experience again!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This darn old SOB a pei<span style="color: #99ccff;">(spit sound)</span>!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few words towards her stomping and trampling was enough, yet he still had to be so cruel to himself and diminish himself. At the end of it he even asked her not to hold on to past enmities as if he was highly principled, and even asked to join hands in advancing forward for the sake of benefiting the Martial Arts Circles!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really wanted to swing a palm over and slap this shameless thing flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>His, Elder Yu's straightforward intestines with nine bends and eighteen twists was spoken of as if it was really straightforward ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Is he treating everyone present as fools?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou indignantly thought, there was no helping it. The other side had already taken the initiative to make peace, if she keeps poking and haggling over every ounce, all the effort she put in earlier would go to waste. At that time, the victim will become the persecution target, even if she wanted to make a comeback it wouldn't be easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plus, there really was a fool that was helping Elder Yu speak. With just a glance she recognized him, wasn't it precisely that person who had jumped out first to stop her from ending the convention?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Elder Yu labored and performed many meritorious services for the sake of the Martial Arts Circles. He has rushed about for half a lifetime so he is a bit excessively cautious, but this is human nature, it's only natural."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come to think of it, Alliance Head </span><i><span style>da ren</span></i><span style>'s breadth of mind is wide, he won't bother over so much. Elder Yu can just relax and be at ease!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We should probably head back first. We believe Alliance Head will definitely give us a satisfactory explanation!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The subject of the conversation became more and more harmonious, in the end it even came to the point that they were exhorting Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely that Mother Mo Yun. She was currently sitting solemnly upright, giving off the arrogant air of a senior as she spoke meaningfully to Tang Doudou: "Xueyi, you've only just taken the position, there are many things you must learn. Elder Yu had assisted many Alliance Heads before, he has an abundance of experience that we cannot even compare to. You must set down your attitude and properly learn from Elder Yu."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge! Hearing this, Tang Doudou only felt as if several thousand grass mud horses<span style="color: #99ccff;">(f your mom)</span> were wildly rampaging through.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before, she had even quite liked this Mother Mo Yun, feeling that her three views were very upright. Who knew that before this sentence even warmed up, she was ruthlessly slapped in the face?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell, in the past the one that opposed her the most, wasn't it Mo Yun?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vigorously rising up to admonish Xiao Yiyun and tell him that he was not allowed to say bad things about Cloud City's Lord, wasn't that also Mo Yun?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now not having any good things to say to her and also helping speak in favor of Elder Yu, was it still her, Mo Wan?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was slammed by weights in broad daylight!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>How many intentions does she have, Tang Doudou just can't figure it out?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Things having reached this stage, if she still doesn't say anything, she doesn't know what other kind of things this crowd of people will end up saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the surface Tang Doudou was very calm, yet inside, her balls felt like they were breaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mother Mo Yun is right, Xueyi understands!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She's finished, finished! She won't be struck by lightning for saying false words, right? Tang Doudou was very anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En." Seeing that she took advice very well, Mother Mo Yun felt exceptionally satisfied and came up to pat Tang Doudou's shoulder: "Properly do it<span style="color: #99ccff;">(work hard)</span>!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alright, she definitely will properly, very properly, do it<span style="color: #99ccff;">(f***)</span>!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Not 100% sure if the second 干(do sth) is supposed to be a swear word, but it is emphasized so Tang Doudou is either planning something or cursing, or both.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After Tang Doudou replied with a bright fake smile, she immediately turned around and said to everyone: "Since no one has anymore objections, then everyone should head back home to sleep!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really wanted to immediately beat it!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, things just can't go as one wants. Or perhaps the two words 'to sleep' that she spoke were just too alluring, to the extent that the dear friend that had been sleeping from the start until now stood up with a 'whoosh' and yawned: "Can finally go home to sleep!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh? Why is no one leaving?" That person swayed as he walked over, his hair was a complete mess and blocked his line of sight. He lifted his hand to push aside his hair. Unexpectedly, the moment he revealed his face, the sound of sucking in cool air simultaneously filled the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Causing Tang Doudou to be completely baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sangfroid Prince!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Xi Qiuyue!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is he here?!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that was one exclamation of alarm after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nearly all of the people that could sit here were from famous schools on the Jiangu. They had already arrived in Rutaceae Pavilion a day earlier. The ones of circles like the Hall Master He and Syndicate Leader Liu that Tang Doudou saw earlier could only run around outside to rush over here.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">As in, I think the inferior schools are given later notice.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The ones that came tonight were of Hall Master He's circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the servant called out Xi Qiuyue's name earlier, though quite a few people heard, they were all people that were not worth mentioning. In addition, the servant said there was a problem with the invitation, and Bai Feiyun showed up to handle this matter so no one worried about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>They never expected that this Sangfroid Prince would actually be asleep here in the hall and witnessed the entire ins and outs of the convention.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even more surprising was the fact that though the servant had clearly said that there was something wrong with the invitation, at this moment there was actually someone that recognized this person as the Sangfroid Prince, Xi Qiuyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>What's real what's fake, it seriously was a nice puzzling question ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Qiuyue? Tang Doudou knitted her brows, a trace of waves rippled through her eyes. A person from the Imperial Household?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>According what Bai Feiyun said before, earlier he was even making a racket to find her?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then this will be troublesome ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether it was regarding her or regarding the Alliance Head Command Tablet, these were all matters of the Jianghu. The things put into the pan to stir-fry were all her own family's vegetables.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But since ancient times, the relationship between the Imperial Household and the Martial Arts Circles has been as incompatible as fire and water. Neither motherfunker* could deal with the other. Couldn't swallow it down but also couldn't puke it out, both looked at each other with disgust. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Tang Doudou uses a lot of less offensive versions of swear words. When it comes that she outright goes completely profane, I will use the most equivalent term.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, as far as one could see, everyone's eyes were blazing with flames. Their expressions showed that with just one inciting remark they would get rid of Xi Qiuyue's genitals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only one that was different was Elder Yu. His pair of triangular eyes* were already emitting fresh light. Looking at the Sangfroid Prince Xi Qiuyue, his thick beard covered mouth crooked, almost unable hold back a smile.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Triangular eyes</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Tang Doudou bit her lower lip. Her black agate-like pupils turned towards the unintelligible Xi Qiuyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The latter seemed to have sensed something and was just about to turn his head to look over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enormous sound of impact sounded out. The Sangfroid Prince turned his head, stupefied: "Who hit..... </span><i><span style>ben</span></i><span style>...... </span><i><span style>ben wang</span></i><span style>*......"</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">本王 - "ben wang" way for speaker to refer to himself in third person. Aka, something like 'this king' or 'this imperial son'</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>His pupils didn't even make it to Tang Doudou before with a 'thump' he fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou took back the wooden stick in her hands and under the stunned gazes of the crowd patted off her hands: "The martial arts convention was first infiltrated by people of the Demonic Sect, now it's been infiltrated by someone from the Imperial Household. It looks like the defenses of Rutaceae Pavilion need to be strengthened!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, taking advantage of the time before Elder Yu was able to react, she stomped a foot on the Sangfroid Prince's face: "Someone come! Drag this guy down for this Alliance Head. When I have time I'll properly investigate what exactly this Imperial Household is planning!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She waited for half a day, yet not a single person came up. Even Elder Yu was silent as a turtle, his shifty eyes filled with the expression of schadenfreude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere was currently subtly changing when suddenly the sound of a flute came from outside. It was melodious and filled the spacious air, traveling over from far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following it, countless fluttering petals made their way in from outside the window, momentarily causing the entire hall to be filled with a sweet fragrance as if meeting spring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fluttering petal sea was outside the window in the endless darkness. Suddenly, a faint light shone. Just as they focused their eyes, they discovered with amazement that it was an extremely beautiful and exquisite palanquin chair. Looking a little closer it would be seen that the ones carrying the chair were four beautiful young girls with gauze veils covering their faces. On either side of the palanquin there were even eight more separate young ladies in the same attire, each holding a musical instrument. That melodious flute music was played precisely by that young girl in the lead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The even more amazing thing was that this procession of people had a ton of petals opening their road and they arrived stepping through the air. It exceedingly resembled the legend of the immortal fairy descending to the world of mortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's eyes even turned dazed from looking!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jesus! The acting ability needed to appear on scene like this is too, way too high!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her curious heart was also almost about to fly past the sky. Who in the world was sitting in that palanquin?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden appearance of a procession of people caused quite a few people in the hall to be shocked dumb. The first to come back to his senses and react was actually the Sangfroid Prince Xi Qiuyue. At some unknown time he had come to stand at Tang Doudou's side. Giving an extremely at odds with the scene belch, he then said: "</span><i><span style>Ben wang</span></i><span style> has seen quite a few prodigal spendthrifts, but still hasn't seen someone this crazy. To actually use this many stunning women to carry a palanquin!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her astonishment, Tang Doudou didn't notice that the one talking to her was the one she had struck unconscious with a smack of a wooden stick. She nodded approvingly: "True. No need to mention those stunning women, just based on the fact they tossed so many flower petals in the dead of winter is already a huge spending of money, isn't it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tsk*, what does this bit count for? Look at that palanquin,</span><i><span style> that's</span></i><span style> the most extravagant squander of money!" Xi Qiuyue shot Tang Doudou a look of disdain, his tone was filled with the connotation that he was very dissatisfied with Tang Doudou's knowledge and experience.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Tsk - sound of clicking the tongue, can be for both admiration or disgust</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Palanquin? I can't see anything special about it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ignorant and inexperienced!" Xi Qiuyue sneered: "Come come, let </span><i><span style>ben wang</span></i><span style> expand your knowledge!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou followed him and leaned over. Xi Qiuyue pointed at the jade-colored dome on top of the palanquin: "See that? That was made by polishing an entire piece of top-notch jadeite! It's extremely rare! Using it to make the roof of a palanquin like this with no other purpose, it's clearly just showing off wealth! And </span><i><span style>ben wang </span></i><span style>dares to guarantee that beneath that palanquin's roof is definitely a layer of warm jade that costs even more than this jadeite! Sitting inside there on this cold winter day that feeling... tsk..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Look at the body of that palanquin, white shine completely penetrates it. Under the moonlight it presents a hazy radiance, do you know what this is?" Xi Qiuyue cast a sidelong glance towards Tang Doudou, particularly smug.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at Tang Doudou again, she was currently crouching down drawing circles on the floor with exceptional bitterness: "That's too much, way too much..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
