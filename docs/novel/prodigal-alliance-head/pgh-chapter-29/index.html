 <p><b>Chapter 29: Butt-Aged Little Brat</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! What are you looking for? Hurry up and come help!” When Tang Doudou lifted her eyes she discovered Jun Xin was currently looking at her with an odd expression and she immediately called him over to help. These ancient styled clothing are just a bother, it’s not convenient at all to move about in. Just kneading some dough caused her entire body to be covered with flour.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin rolled his eyes and humphed: “Wasn’t it you that told me to keep watch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you keep watch just cause I told you to keep watch, if I told you to go eat shit will you just go and do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You go eat shit!” Jun Xin angrily said. The dagger in his hand flashed with cold light and brushed past the side of Tang Doudou’s face, stabbing into the cupboard behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he coldly warned: “Work faster. Any more words and I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This violent butt-aged little brat!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, I’m just making a comparison. Don’t mind it too much……” Tang Doudou waved her hand. Not daring to call him again, she went to work busily herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Work a bit faster. Once it hits the next hour Meng Yu will come!” After a while, Jun Xin started to urge again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dagger was still stabbed into the cupboard. Tang Doudou didn’t dare to infuriate him again and could only say with an annoyed tone: “What do you keep repeating for? I am hurrying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Making something this hurriedly and hastily, is it possible for it to taste good?” Jun Xin saw that she had bustled around half the day yet she still hadn’t made a fire and started to doubt Tang Doudou’s cooking skills again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou cursed him silently in her heart but her mouth replied: “Just watch your door properly, it’ll be ready in a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin gave a humph and ignored her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damned tsundere!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour went by.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it ready or not?!” Jun Xin stood up, unable to wait any longer: “Meng Yu is almost here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s almost ready, almost ready!” Tang Doudou fished out the thing in the pot and rolled it in the seasoning tray. A fragrant scent immediately filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smelling this Jun Xin’s heart tickled with a hard to endure itch. Where did he have the mind to still care about watching the door? He ran over, reached out, grabbed that strip and popped it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ssss! So hot, so spicy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fragrant spicy taste exploded inside his mouth, a hundred flavors occurring at the same time! But it was really way too spicy, Jun Xin didn’t have the time to reflect on the taste. After swallowing it down in one bite, he stuck out his tongue and fanned it as if his life depended on it: “Why did you put chili! Don’t tell me you don’t know I don’t eat chili!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huai City is a region in South Province and they don’t like eating chili. Jun Xin, this locally born and bred Huai City citizen was even less able to stand this spicy taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt wrongly accused: “You never said that you didn’t eat it ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou moved closer and asked: “How is it? How’s the taste?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin paused for a moment, reflecting on the taste in his mouth: “The taste is actually not bad, it’s just a bit too spicy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though it’s a bit spicy, the taste really was not bad. There was a sort of still wanting to eat more impulse after eating. </span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Helplessly Jun Xin swept a glance at the chili oil filled tray. If it was just a little bit less spicy it’d be perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his thoughts, Tang Doudou laughed ‘hehe’ and said: “Wait a sec.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin looked at her, not understanding. Tang Doudou lifted her brows and blended some less spicy ones and handed it to him: “Here, eat. Don’t worry, it’s not spicy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Jun Xin unhurriedly pick up the chopsticks and clip a piece. Hesitantly putting it into his mouth, his expression froze. Immediately, happiness rose to the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though it was still a bit spicy, it was within a tolerable range.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>And precisely because it wasn’t too spicy, that savory spice became even more rich. This time when he started eating he couldn’t stop anymore. One piece after another was thrown into his mouth. During an idle time he didn’t forget to ask Tang Doudou: “What’s this thing called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spicy strips!” Tang Doudou chuckled ‘hehe’ as she picked up that extremely spicy plate and put it into a food box.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Spicy strips</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Jun Xin asked again: “You’re leaving?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My stomach is full, the tasty thing is also made. If I don’t leave then do I wait here for you to ask me out to eat?” Tang Doudou patted the food box. Walking to the window, she looked outside, then put the food box on the windowsill, about to climb out the window and leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a good door right here for you to walk through, what are you going out the window for?” Jun Xin knitted his brows, seeing her climb several times but still unable to climb out. He couldn’t help but roll his eyes, how could there be someone this stupid in the world?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When have you ever seen someone steal something then walk out the front door?” Tang Doudou disdainfully humphed. With a push she jumped out. Picking up the food box, she waved her hand at Jun Xin: “Butt-aged little brat, I’m leaving first! Byebye~”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing those words, Jun Xin’s face instantly turned black. With a move of his hand, the dagger returned to his grasp.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, how could Tang Doudou still hang around and wait for him to make a move against her. Bending down at her waist, she felt along the wall and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Butt-aged little brat, don’t blame</span><i><span style> jiejie</span></i><span style> for being hard-hearted towards you. Without selling you out, </span><i><span style>jiejie </span></i><span style>wouldn’t be able to walk out ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giggling ‘hehe’, she heard a loud ‘bang’ sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately following that was the sound of Jun Xin’s miserable shriek mixed with an angry howl as if the lioness from Hedong was roaring: “Jun Xin you little son of a bitch! You’re here to steal food again! Bastard! Do you know who sent that deer meat!? I’m, I’m gonna beat you to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! Don’t hit the face!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moving along the wall to the door, she peeked in. A devastated miserable shriek came through. Tang Doudou’s guts shook and she hurriedly moved far away from the kitchen and walked back to the original road.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>!” </span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she walked out of the courtyard she heard Qing Yin’s surprised call.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she even had the time to stand steadily, the pretty figure appeared in front of her: “Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, I’ve finally found you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Yin, you came just in time. Hurry and bring me to Baili Yu!” She was just fretting that she couldn’t find someone to bring her to find Baili Yu, this Qing Yin really came just at the right time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin wiped the sweat on her forehead and replied: “Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, Master isn’t here in the garden right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not here?” Tang Doudou looked at the food box in her hand, disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following her gaze and looking over, seeing the box Qing Yin curiously asked: “What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s something good!” Tang Doudou reached out and was just about to open the lid of the box when she suddenly froze: “Qing Yin, can I ask a favor of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no harm in </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>stating it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I made some food, can you help me send it to Baili Yu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’s saying, the stuff in this food box was made by him? Qing Yin was quite surprised and asked: “</span><i><span style>Gongzi </span></i><span style>disappeared for half the day without a trace, it was to go make something to eat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou handed the box over to her: “Don’t worry about so much. Just help me send it to Baili Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin’s expression was troubled and didn’t take the food box: “This, Meng Yu </span><i><span style>jiejie</span></i><span style> has always been in charge of Master’s food. This servant doesn’t dare make a decision without permission. If you want to gift it, it’s best if </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> goes yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say he wasn’t in the garden? If he’s not in the garden, how am I supposed to gift it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This……”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damned little bastard, you still dare to run! When I catch you, see how I’ll sort you out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, a black figure flashed over the wall and dropped down in front of the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jun Xin, why are you here?” </span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the person that dropped down wasn’t the Jun Xin Tang Doudou left behind in the kitchen to distract Meng Yu, who else could it be? By this time, he had long lost his earlier arrogance. When he heard Qing Yin’s voice, he immediately rolled over here: “Qing Yin, hurry and save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha……” Seeing his pathetic appearance, Tang Doudou couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin helplessly asked Jun Xin: “Jun Xin, did you steal food again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t, the one that stole food was him! I’m being framed!” Jun Xin heard Tang Doudou’s laugh and recalling how she abandoned him in the kitchen while running off alone got angry to the point he couldn’t breath properly. Pointing at Tang Doudou he said: “Baili Yu’s pot of deer meat was all eaten by him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re talking about that deer the Chamber of Commerce sent over this morning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What other one is there?” Jun Xin covered his face. Everytime, she<span style="color: #99ccff;">(Meng Ru)</span> always hits his face, too hateful!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Yin, you’re also here?” Sounds of ‘thump thump thump’s transmitted over. Tang Doudou looked over and only saw a five larges three coarses<sup>G</sup> woman panting as she ran out from the courtyard. From the looks of it she was probably around thirty. The two enormous lumps in front of her chest bounced back and forth with her running motions. Every step roused a giant amount of dust, yet her speed was still very fast. In a blink she got to them, gasping so heavily for air that Tang Doudou couldn’t even open her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to imagine that Meng Yu was actually such a heavyweight lady.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meng Yu</span><i><span style> jiejie</span></i><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help, help me catch that brat! Master, Master’s deer meat was secretly eaten by him! Too hateful! I already told Master not to let him in yet Master just refuses to listen every single time! Now it’s just great, he steals food every single day! Seriously infuriating me to death!” Meng Yu ferociously put her hands on her hips as she rained curses.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin poked his head out from behind Qing Yin’s back. Rubbing his eyes, he said: “Meng Yu, don’t frame the innocent. Your deer meat was secretly eaten by this brat, it has nothing to do with me at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pei! When I entered the kitchen I saw you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s cause he sneaked away first!” Jun Xin furiously glared at Tang Doudou: “Stinky little brat, you dare to eat but you don’t dare to admit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This dumb little brat, selling her out just like this. She wasted so many of her spicy strips bribing him! Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. Seeing Meng Yu also glare over, she immediately exposed an extremely innocent expression: “What deer meat? What are you guys talking about? I can’t understand any of it? Hey, that guy whoever you are, we’re total strangers, don’t randomly try to accuse me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This string of words were spoken exceedingly bold and confidently with the sound of justice on her side. Jun Xin’s eyes flipped over, almost fainting from the anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young. Fellow. Jun!” Meng Yu fumed with rage between gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Yin!” Seeing that Meng Yu had already decided it was him, Jun Xin immediately grabbed Qing Yin’s sleeve and pitifully pleaded: “Help me, it really wasn’t me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Jun Xin was beaten by Meng Yu to an inch of his life, but his identity wasn’t simple at all. Of all the people at Baili Yu’s side, there was only Meng Yu that dared to yell and beat him like this. And it’s just because Meng Yu’s culinary skill was seriously good and Jun Xin was also a gluttonous guy. Yet he just wouldn’t eat at the proper place and insists on running to the kitchen to steal food and even has to choose the food Meng Yu specially prepared for Master. Over time, every time Jun Xin came here to steal food it would be noisy to the point chickens fly and dogs leap.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time of this, everyone got used to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But yet this time Li Xueyi also got mixed up in it. Meng Yu didn’t know but she knew. The food box in Tang Doudou’s hand was precisely the one that Meng Yu often uses to carry the Master’s meals in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Jun Xin liked to pilfer food, he would admit it every time he was caught. So for this incident to not be related to Li Xueyi, she, Qing Yin didn’t believe it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meng Yu </span><i><span style>jiejie</span></i><span style>, I think we should just let this go.” </span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let it go?” Meng Yu’s voice got even louder, thundering to the point that everyone present had to cover their ears: “You’re telling me to just let it go! Then Master’s blame, who will bear it for me! And that’s an extremely rare nine color deer, it’s an ingredient I might never have a second chance to work with in this lifetime!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she spoke to the end, her loud voice started sobbing. Her shaking as she sobbed frightened Tang Doudou to the point her heart trembled and trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuuuwwuu…… Do you guys get it?! Do you get it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Yu cried pitifully, in the end she collapsed to a sit onto the floor. Jun Xin scratched his head, particularly uncomfortable. He shot another glare at Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou actually did quite understand Meng Yu’s feelings. When a good cook encounters a rare ingredient, it’s like when an old Buddhist monk who hadn’t seen any females for a few dozen years sees a drop dead beautiful lady; they can’t stop themselves.</span></p>
