 <p><b>Chapter 251.2: Grant a Song</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right ah! Singing!" She plopped down to sit next to Baili Yu, then hooked her finger in his direction. "You want to hear?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu lifted his brows. "If Wife is willing to grant a song, this husband will naturally listen attentively."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahem!" Tang Doudou cleared her throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu waited curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, I'm starting!" Tang Doudou stood up and faced the azure ocean. Her eyes grew deep and reflective as she opened her mouth. "Ah! Large ocean, such vast waters..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu's face twitched and he almost fell into the ocean. Could he take back what he said earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Tang Doudou was already completely absorbed in the beauty of her own song. "Ah! Beautiful ladies, such great legs..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu's smile stiffened on his face. The expression in his eyes could no longer be made out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Baili Yu didn't say anything, Tang Doudou turned around and asked, "It doesn't sound good?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's still alright."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still alright? Then that meant it didn't sound good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was a little depressed. However, she had already boasted about it she couldn't very well accept defeat like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then why don't I switch for a different song?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright." That large ocean, legs, also counted as a song?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu thought about it, then said, "Wife can choose a gentler song."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gentle? Tang Doudou's eyes lit up. Then how about this one?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Over there by the mountains, over there by the sea; is a group of little blue sprites..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How about this time?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Very good."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then listen to this one!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was enjoying herself singing. After singing all three hundred nursery rhymes, she started humming some strange tunes. In any case, she didn't let Baili Yu's ears rest for even a second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the start, Baili Yu felt like these songs were unbearable to listen to, but after listening for a long time, he started feeling like there was some flavor to it. In the end, he started humming along with Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice was very quiet and soft so it was impossible to hear if one didn't listen carefully. However, his low and magnetic voice was very distinct in this quiet ocean environment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That's why, the moment he started humming, Tang Doudou was captivated. She shut up and looked over there only to see that he had at some time closed his eyes. His scarlet lips were slightly parted as a devastatingly beautiful tune drifted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she recalled how she sung earlier, she felt like crawling into a barrel!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as Tang Doudou listened, her expression slowly turned strange and she looked towards Baili Yu nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't help but wonder if she really hummed 'Old Driver' earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And why did Baili Yu choose to sing this song out of all the songs?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. Could it be it was because it was catchy? But she didn't dare to ask because she was afraid Baili Yu would ask her about the name of this song and the lyrics!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily she had only hummed a part of it earlier and didn't actually sing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, if Baili Yu found out about what an inappropriate song he was humming, he'd probably kicked her right off the boat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the start, sailing in the boat was rather a novelty, but after looking at this vast blue water for a long time, Tang Doudou started feeling dizzy and a bit like vomiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Based on our current speed, it'll probably take another half a day for us to arrive. Wife should rest for a while first. I'll wake you up later."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yu saw that Tang Doudou's face was pale, he took off his outer coat and wrapped it around Tang Doudou, then pulled her into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou yawned even as she tried to keep her eyes open. When she heard this, she murmured a reply, then closed her eyes and fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she fell asleep, the smile on Baili Yu's face gradually faded. He gazed towards the calm ocean surface as he thought about something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the sun set, the bright moon rose from the surface of the sea. As the clear cold light spilled onto the sea, the temperature got cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou subconsciously snuggled into Baili Yu's chest but was woken up by the feeling of something hard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What did you put in your chest?" The place it hit was Tang Doudou's face, so she reached out to grab it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't move!" Right as she was reaching over, Baili Yu caught her hand and his low voice transmitted over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou, who was still only half-awake, was puzzled. Why couldn't she grab it? Could it be that hard thing was...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pei</span></i><span style>! Who in the world has that growing on their chest!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou slapped away these unrealistic thoughts and looked up to check Baili Yu's expression. However, all she saw was a sharp chin that seemed to glow beneath the moonlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeming to sense her gaze, Baili Yu looked down and pressed his jade-like finger against his lips as he softly made a shush sound. Following that, he lifted his head again and gazed towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou caught his meaning and also looked in that direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw what was over there, she gulped, then glanced around the boat, seeming to be trying to gauge the safety level of this boat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this moment, Baili Yu roughly shoved her head into his chest and a large force flooded out from his body. A strong gale arose around them and lifted the waves to form a barrier of water around the boat.</span></p>
