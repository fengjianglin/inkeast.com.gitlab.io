 <p><b>Chapter 329.1: Goal Achieved</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou patted Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s face. "Be good and just do as you're told. Asking too much isn't good for you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> immediately stopped crying. After a brief moment, he started crying with even more energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, I knew you were smart." Tang Doudou nodded in satisfaction, then pinched Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s face before getting up. "I'm heading out to handle a few matters, I'll be back soon. No matter what, don't stop before I get back, got it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> hastily nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, good boy. After this is over, I'll help buy your freedom and arrange a place for you to live the rest of your life." After Tang Doudou said that, she took off her pink outer garment, then took off Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s clothes and threw them towards the foot of the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, she jumped out of the window and headed towards the room she had stayed in before. When she saw that there was no one around, she quietly pushed open the window and walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although a lot of events had occurred, barely any time had elapsed since Tang Doudou entered the inn and left the room. Jin Yi had waited outside Yuelai Inn for a while before giving his subordinates the instructions to wait around discreet areas of the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, he quietly landed on the roof and leaned down to listen. After a short while, his face flushed and his expression turned strange. Li Xueyi had actually brought Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> out to do... that!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was preposterous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it wasn't that strange. Li Xueyi has always been infamous. Even if she had returned to her female identity, it was still hard for her to change her vulgar habits. Baili Yu was the one that should be pitied. He had money, influence, and incomparable looks, yet he fell in love with this kind of woman despite all the women available to choose from. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi ordered his subordinates to continue watching the inn, then headed back to Wind Cherishing House.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's no wonder she insisted on bringing Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> out of all those courtesans!" After hearing Jin Yi's report, Gu Xun's facial color turned dark. If she had wanted to do something with Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, she could've just brought him back to Huai City with her. How could she have the mood to play even in such an important moment...</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn't right. Gu Xun furrowed his brows and asked, "Tell me everything she did after she headed out. Don't leave even a single detail out!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"She didn't do anything special. She just strolled around the streets with Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> several times, then headed to the garrison entrance before turning back to head to Yuelai Inn."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stroll? Which street was it on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The street on the east side of Yuelai Inn," replied Jin Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun's expression immediately changed. "Isn't that where Lin Shuxuan is staying? She went to look for Lin Shuxuan!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Yi was confused. "That's impossible, right? She hasn't left Yuelai Inn since going in, and this subordinate personally went to eavesdrop on them..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's something fishy, so be vigilant. Head back and just keep a watch on her for now. Once the time comes, remind her to hurry back. This cannot be delayed, otherwise we'll all be in trouble."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, why go through so much trouble?" Jin Yi couldn't understand why Gu Xun was going to such lengths. Baili Yu and Tang Doudou were currently in their hands, so his master could easily decide those two's fates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun smiled coldly. "What would you know?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"i want to openly become the martial arts alliance head. I'm not aiming to get it with threats and tricks!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This subordinate understands. This subordinate will go right away!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou took that box down from its concealed location above the beam of the roof. After making sure that everything inside was still in order, she jumped back to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a person in the room that had been watching her this whole time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she came down, that person asked quietly, "Alliance Head Li, why were you looking for me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou put away the box, then smiled widely. "Brother Lin, you've been aware of my identity this whole time?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li is overestimating me." Lin Shuxuan laughed politely. "All that I guessed was that Alliance Head Li was female. I had no idea that you were actually the alliance head."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled. "It was that time when we were drinking on the boat, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Brother Lin, to tell the truth, I'm still suspicious of you..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Suspicious of me?" Lin Shuxuan burst out laughing. "What does Alliance Head Li need to be suspicious of me for?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't explain and just continued, "Brother Lin, I indeed have something to request of you. Will you be able to help me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan could tell that it was an urgent matter since she was being so straightforward about it. After considering it a moment, he nodded. "As long as it's something I can help with, I'll definitely help."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, Brother Lin, this is something you'll definitely be able to help with!" Tang Doudou pulled him over. "It's like this, my situation is a bit troublesome right now. I'm being held captive in Wind Cherishing House."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh?" Lin Shuxuan was surprised. "But you're the martial arts alliance head. That Wind Cherishing House..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's because of the owner of Wind Cherishing House. We have a bit of history, and now I've fallen into his hands. That's why I spent so much time strolling on the streets. I had no choice but to use the methods you told me about a few days ago to contact you instead of looking for you directly. Right now, this inn is also surrounded by his men."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want me to help you escape from Wind Cherishing House?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No! To leave Hibiscus Garrison."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This..." An unreadable expression flashed through the depths of Lin Shuxuan's eyes. "Alright. Then Alliance Head Li, please tell me how I can help you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled mysteriously, then leaned closer to his ear and whispered into it.</span></p>
