 <p><b>Chapter 319.2: Do You Mind It?</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Baili Yu's expression became a bit hurt and he asked softly, "Do you mind it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Uh, could she say that she minded?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that wasn't the important part!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked at him worriedly. "It's not a question of whether I mind or not, but whether you've been..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavens ah, this was a male brothel! With Baili Yu's city-toppling looks and currently defenseless situation, it was incomparably dangerous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You mind it?" Baili Yu asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's heart was filled with conflicting emotions. She couldn't say that she didn't mind, because she really did mind a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She cared about Baili Yu's safety and purity. However, regardless of whether he had been taken or not, he was still her husband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how was she supposed to tell Baili Yu about this? Losing their chastity was probably a very severe matter to straight men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, he already had a wife. She came from a future world in which science and technology exposed her to many more strange things, thus she was able to open-mindedly accept a lot of matters. However, Baili Yu was someone of the ancient era. Would he fall into despair because she minded and end up turning homosexual?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was a fujoshi, there was no way she could accept her man turning gay!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger rushed to her head and she pulled Baili Yu up. "Let's go! I'll help you get justice!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu immediately understood what she was thinking when he heard this, and he wrapped his arms around her tightly. "It's fine as long as you don't mind."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It doesn't matter whether I mind or not! What matters is you!" Tang Doudou looked at Baili Yu, worried that he wouldn't be able to get over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu laughed lightly. "If you don't mind, then what does it matter?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh?" What exactly did he mean by this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu didn't gave her a chance to ask about it. He lifted her chin with a slender finger and slowly lowered his head. When Tang Doudou felt his hot breath, she blushed and nervously gripped his clothes. Was... was this a good time?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang bang bang</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the two were about to kiss, deafening knocks came from the door. There was a shrill shout that sounded like an eunuch's voice. "Escort Xue! Are you ready yet!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou turned her head away in a fluster and pushed Baili Yu towards the room. "Y-you should hurry and go out!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she said that, she felt like her words sounded off. "Don't worry, I'll definitely get you out of here. Trust me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En." As Baili Yu gazed at her blushing face, for the first time, he felt like his heart, which had always felt empty, was filled. It was a very comfortable sensation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knocking and shouting still hadn't stopped. Tang Doudou stood outside the window for a moment, then she reached out, wrapped her arms around Baili Yu's neck, and pressed her lips against his quickly before turning and running away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu hastily reached out to pull her back, but it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thud</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aaah!!!! My buns!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu covered his eyes but still couldn't suppress the urge to take a look. Tang Doudou had landed splat on her front and was shrieking miserably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm... I'm fine..." Tang Doudou reached lifted a hand and waved. "You, should hurry and go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, I'll wait for you." After saying this, Baili Yu left the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stayed there for a while until the pain dulled before finally getting off the ground. She rubbed her buns as she inwardly remarked that it was a good thing she had stuffed a lot of cotton clothes in front for her disguise. Otherwise, her buns would have been squished flat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu was sure heartless. He really believed her when she said she was fine and didn't stay around to comfort her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou walked into the building with a lot of silent grudges. Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, who hadn't seen her leave, was stunned when he saw her again. "S-s-s-sir T-t-tang... W-why are you..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes at him. "Why're you stuttering so much? T-t-tang what? This master doesn't have any candy for you, move out of the way already!" <span style="color: #3366ff">(Tang = candy)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>She was angry and a little resentful. Upon hearing her irritated tone, Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> hastily moved aside to let her in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou made sure to glance around the hall first before walking in. She didn't see Lin Shuxuan and the other guys that were usually with him, so they were probably in a private room. Since they were in the private room, she'll just stay here. In any case, there were a lot of people here and everyone would be focused on the stage, so she probably wouldn't be noticed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She found a place in the corner to sit down and called Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> over. "My throat isn't feeling well, so in a bit, help me shout the price!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't this guest's throat perfectly fine?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He recalled the deafening shout from earlier and was very speechless. However, he was trained well so he said with a professional smile, "Understood."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded in satisfaction. "If you serve me well, there'll be a big reward."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s eyes lit up. This guest had a bad temper, but he was very generous. Escort Xue had only chatted with him for a while but he got so many benefits. If he was able to get this guest to take a fancy to him and successfully get onto this guest's bed, wouldn't he get even more rewards?</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">C: Lmao, it feels like they've gone on completely different trails of thought. Baili Yu may have touched other people, but Tang Doudou thought he was penetrated by other people.</span></p>
