 <p><b>Chapter 358.2: Meteorite</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking for a while, Tang Doudou saw that there was an enormous room in front of them. In the center of that room was an enormous glowing black rock that was full of tiny potholes. She almost instantly identified it. Wasn't that a meteorite?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would there be a meteorite below a sinkhole? And it was even in a karst cave. This was extremely unusual. Based on how large this meteorite was, it wasn't possible for it to have been carried here by people. It had probably fallen in here somehow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you know what this is?" Ninth Uncle instructed for her to stop walking, then questioned her coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Tang Doudou didn't want to answer, but on a whim she answered, "It's a meteorite ah!"</span><span style>"A meteorite?" Ninth Uncle seemed to be puzzled by this term. "What meteorite?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was speechless. Could it be that he seriously didn't know what this and was serious in asking her? How unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want to know? Humph, I won't tell you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Ninth Uncle didn't get angry this time and just walked forward to stroke the meteorite with an infatuated expression. "I had discovered this by chance. I call it Saint Stone, you know why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't want to answer him. Since he didn't seem to be planning to leave, she found a place to sit down in order to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninth Uncle's temperament seemed to completely change. When Tang Doudou didn't pay attention to him, he didn't seem annoyed and just continued on his own, "Because I discovered that it had a very mysterious ability, it's a discovery that will change the era! I've been studying it these past years in order to use it to create the thing I want."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. What mysterious ability could a meteorite have? It just contained a lot of metal, how could it possibly change the era? She really couldn't understand the world of a psycho!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninth Uncle was still there mumbling something, but Tang Doudou's head felt very heavy and she couldn't hear him clearly. She moved her hands behind her in preparation to shift towards a more comfortable sleeping position, but she suddenly felt something smooth and cold. It felt like a dead person's hand! Her drowsiness was immediately shocked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's fearfully shifted her gaze towards her hand. It was truly that it'd be fine if you didn't look, but that you'd be scared to death the moment you looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately jumped backward like a frightened rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared in alarm at the place she was sitting. It turned out that it wasn't flat ground but a pile of rotting corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could faintly see that the conditions of the corpses weren't the same. Some had rotted so much that there was pretty much only bone left while others were just in livor mortis…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou only had a quick look, but her stomach churned and she started vomiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frick! No wonder she felt like there was a strange smell, so it was due to these corpses!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that she was going to end up like this too?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't dare to think any further along these lines. She threw up everything in her stomach. Once there was finally nothing left to throw up, she lifted her head and leaned against the meteorite behind her and gasped to catch her breath. There was no way she'd let herself die in this sort of place and rot!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meteorite was not that large. Ninth Uncle walked around it several times before finally stopping in front of Tang Doudou again. "You're probably honored to become my experimental subject. You should thank me. This will wash away your crimes and you'll become a stepping stone on my tribe's path to glory!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pei</span></i><span style>! Who would feel honored to become a stepping stone! You can have this honor, she had no interest in it, replied Tang Doudou silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was originally going to just kill you in order to prevent any unexpected occurrences, but I've changed my mind. Killing you outright is such a bore, it'd be much better to torment you until you wished to die. If I didn't do that, I'd be wasting the wonderful chance that the Heavens gave me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Heavens will punish you sooner or later for your sins!"</span><span style>"Humph! Even so, you won't live to see that day!" Ninth Uncle laughed coldly, then walked up to drag Tang Doudou again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Tang Doudou had recovered some strength, it was still far from enough to escape, so she couldn't do anything as Ninth Uncle dragged her towards the top of the meteorite. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The meteorite was round, but due to its size, the top still seemed like flat ground. There was a large hole in the meteorite that was pitch black and gave off a cold air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn't seem very similar to the small holes at the side. It seemed to have been chiseled out by someone, there were dig marks near the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, meteorites had high metallic content. There was no way it could be dug into that easily. This Ninth Uncle sure was strong, to have been able to dug out such a large hole. However, the main question was, what did he make such a large hole for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed that she would find out soon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninth Uncle laughed strangely. "You must be wondering what this hole is for?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Nope!" Even if she was, there was no way she'd tell him! Tang Doudou rolled her eyes, but before she even finished the motion, she felt the tug of gravity. She looked down in surprise and her soul got scared flying.</span></p>
