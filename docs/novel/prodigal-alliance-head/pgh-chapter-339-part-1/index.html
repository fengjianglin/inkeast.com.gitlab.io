 <p><b>Chapter 339.1: Nan Maner and Xiao Ziyu</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, that young master waved dismissively. "Who wants a private room? This place is nice and spacious, why go through that trouble? Quit wasting time and prepare the food!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter saw that he was determined, so he just shook his head and withdrew. </span></p>
 <p><span style>That young master dusted off his clothes, then smiled towards the lingering guests. "What are you all standing for? Sit down and eat. It's fine, it's just a young couple fighting. Fighting at the head of the bed and making up at the end of it is nothing out of the ordinary!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, he sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of the guests that were about to head up saw that the group had stopped arguing, so after thinking a little, several people sat back down. This naturally included Baili Yu and Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after they sat down, Nangong Yan abruptly started throwing things again and some things flew towards Liu Zhiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It actually ended up hitting a woman that was behind Liu Zhiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked over and saw that a woman was slowly getting up from the ground while holding her forehead. They were stunned since they hadn't noticed a woman being there earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou also looked over. She found that face familiar at first glance. Wasn't that Nan Maner?</span><span style>Why was she here as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she could think about it, the young man got up, pointed at Nangong Yan, then started shouting, "Nangong Yan, you shouldn't think that you can do whatever you want just because you're the Eldest Miss of Wind Cloud Island! Hurry up and apologize to that lady, otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou burst out laughing. These two actually knew each other?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nangong Yan had always been unbridled. She turned around and just started jeering at him, "I was wondering who it was, so it was Xiao </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>! What? Could it be that you know her? That's nothing strange, the entire world knows of Xiao </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>'s flirtatious habits. You probably know more ladies then there are people in the Jianghu. Your desire to protect flowers is understandable."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Maner's head was bleeding heavily from that hit so her round black eyes were filled with grievances. When she heard something about a Xiao </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, she glanced over and instantly flushed. Why would it be him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Ziyu curved his lips slightly to give her a flirtatious smile, causing Nan Maner's face to flush even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Nangong Yan saw the two throwing each other looks, she became even angrier. Why was it that others could be together with the person they liked but she had ended up with a damned slave…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more she thought about it, the angrier she became and every sentence contained mockery as she spoke, "Oh! So you do know each other? Should it be said that Xiao </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> truly is good at socializing? Any casual person this miss throws something at ends up being an old friend of yours. Ha… Manor Master Xiao, I think you should take a better look. This is someone of the Seven Great Saint Tribes. If you want to be with her, your grandfather will probably break your legs!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Ziyu was stunned for a moment and looked towards Nan Maner in surprise. He didn't seem to have been aware of her identity. However, his gaze soon became resolved again. "Heaven and Earth stand witness to my feelings for Maner, so Grandfather will probably also understand and allow us to be together!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nangong Yan laughed coldly. "You say it easily, but there's no need for me to bring up the turbulent relationship between the Xiao family and the Seven Great Saint Tribes. Nan Maner isn't just someone of the Seven Great Saint Tribes, she's the Saint Maiden! Do you really think your grandfather would allow you to be together with the Saint Maiden of the Saint Tribes? Keep dreaming!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Xiao Ziyu and Nan Maner's faces turned pale. Every single word had hit their sore spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou who was just watching the show chewed on her chopsticks as she inwardly laughed. After a while of not seeing her, Nangong Yan's ability to talk had really improved. If it weren't for the fact that she had to keep her identity a secret, she definitely would've taught Nangong Yan a good lesson on Nan Maner's behalf. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she could only watch right now. She sighed and stuffed a steamed bun into her mouth. That Xiao Ziyu was a complete idiot. All he was doing was bickering with Nangong Yan. Didn't he see that Nan Maner's head was bleeding? Her entire face was about to be dyed red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this continued on, that girl would probably die from blood loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in Tree Valley, if it hadn't been this girl's help, she would've still been trapped in Tree Valley as a blood bank. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But didn't this girl's feelings change way too fast?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back when they were in Tree Valley, she had been constantly talking about Mu Ye, but now it looks like she had already given her heart to this Xiao Ziyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young girl's heart truly was a needle in the ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So should she help or not?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Ziyu also felt his heart ache to see Nan Maner bleeding. He glowered at Nangong Yan, then said with a cold laugh, "Nangong Yan! If you have the time to get involved in my business, why don't you use that time to worry about yourself? Every famous household already knows about what happened to you. No matter how much your father dotes on you, he's not the only one that makes decisions on Wind Cloud Island. Your master has long already given the Wind Cloud Command. He's bound to catch you sooner or later. I'm not inclined to do such a petty thing as tattle on your whereabouts, but I hope you'll also stop sticking your nose into other people's affairs and hurry up and leave with those servants of yours!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Cloud Island had actually used the Wind Cloud Command on Nangong Yan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the people in the inn weren't people of the Jianghu, but they were still stunned by this news. The Wind Cloud Command hadn't been used for several years. The last time had been over a dozen years ago and had been used when someone infiltrated Wind Cloud Island to steal the valuable Clear Water Glass. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would've imagined that the next time they heard of the Wind Cloud Command, it would be used on Nangong Yan, who had always been extremely doted on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This outrageous news really made people wonder what exactly Nangong Yan did to make the masters of Wind Cloud Island so angry?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They glanced towards Liu Zhiyuan who had said that she was pregnant and started wondering, could it be that she had…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several people considered leaving. It was best to get out of here after learning such important news.</span></p>
