 <p><b>Chapter 259.1: I'm Not Used To It Either</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Tang Doudou thought that Mu Ye had disappeared, she felt a soft pat on her shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye's voice came from behind her. "What are you looking at?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou heard his voice, she hastily turned around. "I'm looking for you ah! Where did you go?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>An oil paper bag appeared in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she took it, Mu Ye said, "See if it's tasty?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no trace of coldness in his eyes right now. His ice-blue eyes were as gentle as a deep clear spring. Tang Doudou was taken aback and a little flustered, so she hastily looked away and grabbed the thing from the bag to shove it into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she shoved it into her mouth, she abruptly looked into the bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then her stomach churned and she started vomiting as she leaned against a nearby tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of confusion flashed through Mu Ye's eyes. He heard people say that this was very tasty earlier, so he brought some for Tang Doudou to have as breakfast. They all said it was tasty, but why did she end up vomiting?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he was wondering about this, he walked over and handed her a canteen of water. "You're pregnant?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pffff!" Tang Doudou hadn't vomited all of it out earlier, but when she heard this, everything else in her stomach came up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt horrible after she finished vomiting. She saw that Mu Ye was still offering her the canteen with a worried expression so she took it with a wry smile. After rinsing out the strange taste in her mouth, she leaned against the tree weakly and gasped for breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye thought for a moment, then said, "I'll see you back to the inn. You shouldn't run around in this condition."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. "I'm not pregnant."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But you vomited," said Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. She patted his shoulder as she asked, "Who told you that if someone vomits, it means they're pregnant?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of embarrassment seemed to flash through Mu Ye's eyes. "Everyone who's pregnant seemed to be like this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who were you looking at that was pregnant?" asked Tang Doudou curiously. The Leader of the Demonic Sect would observe pregnant people for fun?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye's expression immediately turned cold again and he didn't reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fine. This question was also off-limits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou exhaled. The strange taste in her mouth was still present. "Where did you buy this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye glanced at the oil paper bag. "On the streets."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then do you know what this is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's food."</span><span style>Tang Doudou was about to fall apart. "You didn't ask what kind of food it was?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They said it was tasty."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was speechless. Last time, when he gave her the fruits of the sacred tree, he also seemed to have said that it looked tasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she didn't speak, Mu Ye seemed to realize why she vomited. He looked slightly crestfallen. "It's not tasty?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou shook her head. "It's tasty, but I'm not used to this taste."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a genuine foodie, but there was just one thing she really couldn't take, which was steamed buns with Chinese chives! </span></p>
 <p><span style>What Mu Ye brought to her was precisely that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it weren't for the fact that she had been too stunned by the expression in his eyes, there was no way she would have missed the distinctive smell of Chinese chives, much less shoved so much into her mouth. She had practically been about to vomit her stomach out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So it's like this." Mu Ye seemed to have finally understood. He took the bun from her hand and shoved it in his own mouth. After chewing it a couple times, he spat it on the ground. "I'm not used to it either."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was baffled. What did he mean by this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'll go buy some more for you." After Mu Ye said this, he moved to leave again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn't dare to let him go off by himself to buy food again. She hastily grabbed him. "It's fine, Mu Ye. I don't really have an appetite right now so let's go deal with our main matters first."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would be able to pig out right after vomiting after all?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her stomach, still feeling awful. However, as she rubbed, she sensed something strange. The inner strength in her dantian seemed to be gradually coming back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Main matters? Do you have something urgent you need to do?" The black robe went over the arms so Mu Ye hadn't seen her stomach-rubbing moment. When he saw that she wasn't moving, he asked her this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was in the middle of mulling over why her inner strength suddenly recovered when she heard this question. She glanced up at him, puzzled. "You don't have something you need to do?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No."</span></p>
 <p><span style>...then what did they come out for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I wanted to bring you out to walk around. It's good for speeding recovery," said Mu Ye evasively after he was silent for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Tang Doudou hadn't been distracted by her inner strength coming back, she probably would have noticed that something was off about Mu Ye. However, right now, when she heard that he didn't have anything to do, she just replied with an 'oh,' then suggested, "Why don't we take a look at where they'll be holding the conference?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It hasn't started," replied Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, I mean let's just look around a little." Tang Doudou shook her head, then started muttering to herself again. "Why does it feel like my inner strength is recovering?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye heard both sentences, but he didn't ask about it and just walked forward silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Tang Doudou found it strange, since nothing else seemed off about her body, she stopped worrying about it and focused on following after Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason she wanted to go to the conference place was because she wanted to see if she could meet up with Baili Yu.</span></p>
