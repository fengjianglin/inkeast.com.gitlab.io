 <p><b>Chapter 101.1: Mu Ye Smiled</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her white, jade-like skin was tinged with a healthy peach glow. Her fine hair was pulled into a high ponytail, exposing her bright and clean nape. From her neck, his gaze shifted to her smooth earlobes. They were chubby and exceptionally cute. She wasn’t very tall so when he lowered his eyes slightly, he could see her long eyelashes that cast butterfly wing shadows on her cheeks. Below her delicate little nose was soft pink lips…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Adam’s apple moved. Mu Ye felt that his throat was a bit dry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, I really stopped!?” Seeing as Mu Ye didn’t react for a long while, Tang Doudou opened her eyes on her own. In any case, he never said she needed to keep her eyes close. It was fine as long as she kept her inner </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>sinking down!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she opened her eyes, she saw that beneath her the bamboo leaves were rippling like green waves in the slight breeze. It was beautiful to the point it took one’s breath away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How pretty!” Her bright eyes started to sparkle even more. She reached out her fingers to touch the wind and giggled from the ticklish feeling. The sound of her laughter drifted very far in the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of cheerful laughter jolted Mu Ye back to his senses and he released her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou turned around to look at Mu Ye and flicked his shoulder. “Hey, aren’t I smart? I got it so fast!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What a boring person. Tang Doudou shrugged and shifted her weight to her toes to try leaping forward again. After she started revolving her inner </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>the way Mu Ye instructed, it was much easier to move than before. She continuously tested it out and her movements became more and more practiced. After she made a couple rounds over the top of the bamboo forest, she was able to move fluently with qinggong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou returned to Mu Ye’s side once again. Folding her hands behind her back, she winked charmingly at Mu Ye. “Teacher Mu, aren’t you going to praise me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye glanced at her coldly. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go where?” asked Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye said, “You don’t want to leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do ah…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she even finished speaking, Mu Ye had shot off like an arrow towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou curled her lips. What’re you showing off for ah? She can do it too, alright?</span><span style>She smiled cockily and rushed after Mu Ye, flying as lightly as a swallow. Her inner strength was profound to the point even Mu Ye had been injured by its vibration. In addition, she had compared her previous method with Mu Ye’s earlier when she was revolving her qinggong and it was clear that her method was better by a large margin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, she switched to her own method and her speed instantly increased. In a few moments, she had caught up to Mu Ye who was in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye was also pretty shocked to see that she had caught up. However, he instantly realized that it was due to her original technique. His cold eyes lifted and he rushed out again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wasn’t willing to take it lying down and pursued him tightly. The two started racing, one pursuing after the other, above the bamboo trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, they reached the edge of the forest. Tang Doudou stopped and waited until her footing was steady before turning to look behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye landed next to her, a step slower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heehee, wonder if Teacher Mu has ever heard of this saying, ‘the rear waves of the Yangtze River drive on those before, the previous waves die upon the sandy shores’?”<span style="color: #3366ff"> (the newer generations always surpass previous generations)</span> Tang Doudou narrowed her eyes as she fixed her gaze on Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s really a shame!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smacked her lips and was about to say something else when Mu Ye spoke again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da freak? This iceberg actually praised her!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou covered her little heart and looked incredulously towards Mu Ye as she muttered, “A-are you still Mu Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing her dim-witted appearance, Mu Ye’s cold eyes thawed like the way flowers bloomed in the spring warmth and revealed a gentle expression. His pressed together lips slightly lifted in the refreshing wind. When his deep gaze swept over, it sized one’s soul like a sea of stars, causing even Tang Doudou’s super thick skin to turn uncontrollably red. Isn’t this iceberg a little ridiculously good-looking when he smiles!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sighed emotionally. However, when she tried to look closer, she discovered that the smile seemed almost like an illusion. It wasn’t on Mu Ye’s face at all.</span><span style>Could it be it was really a hallucination?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wrinkled her nose. That didn’t seem right ah, how could she have hallucinated?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye once again returned to his cold manner. Tang Doudou was still confused over whether he had actually smiled earlier or not so she didn’t notice that Mu Ye’s ears were red as heated iron. It was clear that he was currently very perturbed. At the very least, he wasn’t as cold as he acted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two once again returned to the ground. Tang Doudou saw that the sea of flowers was only one step away so her excitement drove her confusion to the back of her head. She grabbed Mu Ye’s hand and ran outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She easily made it to the flower sea. Where was there any sort of array!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said, “Aren’t we out? How exactly did you end up wandering inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye didn’t elaborate in response to her question. He just started walking towards the middle of the flower sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced around and confirmed that this was precisely the place she had entered the bamboo forest. Then, she followed him.</span></p>
