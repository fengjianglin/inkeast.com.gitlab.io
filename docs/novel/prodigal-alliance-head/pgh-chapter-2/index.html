 <p><b>Chapter 2: Inconceivable, Transmigration? </b></p>
 <p><span style>When her thoughts traveled here, Tang Doudou let out an evil laugh and kneaded that soft breast a couple times. Faking a lecherous expression, she said, "The feel's not bad, how old are you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman's entire body turned soft at Tang Doudou's&nbsp;touch and she softly moaned, "Replying&nbsp;</span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>,</span> <span style>this servant has just passed her sixteenth."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sixteen? Auntie, from your looks, you had to be at least thirty-six already! Tang Doudou silently exclaimed&nbsp;in her heart. However, she still kept a vulgar smile on her face and said, "Oh, still quite inexperienced, huh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Gongzi</span></i><span style>..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman's bashful look caused even Tang Doudou's heart to throb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Gongzi,</span></i><span style> the spring nights are bitterly short*, why don't you let</span> <span style>this servant hurry and help you undress so that we can head to bed!"</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">"the spring nights are bitterly short" is a saying that refers to the fact that in one's life, the happiest/pleasurable moments are never long enough.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"The sisters are all impatient from waiting ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that she had finally reacted to their advances, all the women in the room approached and encircled her. All of them had alluring, ‘the-gentleman-may-do-whatever-he-pleases’ manners. Tang Doudou&nbsp;feared that if she had been a man, she would've already pounced on them with her eyes shining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the old heavens gave her a female body, not to mention she didn’t know how many cameras were installed in this room. No way did she want to do any on-the-spot live broadcast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big sisters, look at how many of you there are. I'm afraid that no matter how awesome I may be, I still wouldn't be able to satisfy you guys!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's eyes slightly narrowed as she continued acting. From the overall situation, she knew that the role she was given was that of a playboy, so naturally she couldn't act very honorably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But unexpectedly,&nbsp;the moment she said that those women all started laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou also laughed, staying in the character of an old pervert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Gongzi</span></i><span style>, how could you be so unduly humble? Look at </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, your formidable and majestic body. Even if ten more sisters came, presumably... presumably it would still be nothing difficult..."</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>Pffff!</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou spurted out a mouthful of old blood a distance away. The hell you mean by formidable and majestic, having ten more? The hell, you think I'm&nbsp;a studhorse?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This script was way too crazy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou forced a laugh and waved her hand, "This </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>is tired today. I don't want to move, let's play something fresh. This big uncle will bestow a large reward on&nbsp;whoever does&nbsp;the best"</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Calling yourself big sister, uncle, grandfather in Chinese conversation is often used to show arrogance or an informal joking manner. Also, the word for uncle is also used to refer to the masters of a house so it's used a lot to act arrogant.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she vigorously patted her chest a few times, acting like a cocky and wealthy big master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, after a few couple pats, her smile froze on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What the hell!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where's her chest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lowered her head to look. "Ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Goddammit, where did her meat buns go!? As Tang Doudou went through and felt her entire body from head to toe, she soon&nbsp;discovered another, even more shocking matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had actually turned into a man!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A broad palm with prominent joints, with just one look you could tell that it was a man's hand. On her body was a moon-white ancient-styled chang pao and a folded paper fan was even tucked at her waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of situation was this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was thoroughly confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don't tell her that while she was sleeping, the staff of this program even changed her clothes and styled her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Gongzi, gongzi</span></i><span style>..." While&nbsp;Tang Doudou was lost in thought, those women approached again. "</span><i><span style>Gongzi</span></i><span style>, why did you end up in a daze again?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wait, wait, ahem! Do you guys have a mirror here?" Tang Doudou currently didn't have the mind to tangle with these women again. She could still understand if her meat buns were gone, but this palm of hers was clearly a man's! Modern technology had no way of&nbsp;transforming her this way in such a short time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a flash of lightning streaked through her mind and with a rumble thundered Tang Doudou until she was scorched on the outside and tender within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don't tell her she transmigrated? And even transmigrated into a man's body! Heavens, how could&nbsp;this be!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's expression was complete chaos. Meanwhile, those women had already found an antique copper mirror from somewhere and brought it here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Gongzi,</span></i><span style> what do you need a mirror for?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou took the mirror without replying, because how could she have the mind to care about that woman's question right now? Her little heart thudded 'thump thump thump'. If she really transmigrated into a man's body, this was all f-ing seriously too shocking, wasn't it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted the mirror with trembling hands.&nbsp;The muddy yellow surface of the copper mirror was smooth and shiny, and on its surface, the image of a face was reflected clearly.</span></p>
