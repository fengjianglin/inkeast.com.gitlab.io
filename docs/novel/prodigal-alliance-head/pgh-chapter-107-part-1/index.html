 <p><b>Chapter 107.1: Can’t Die</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan regained control over his emotions and ordered, “Call all the doctors from the Chamber of Commerce over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In regards to medical expertise, only the Imperial Physicians of the Imperial Palace could compare with the doctors of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even the Imperial Physicians might not be as good as the doctors from the Chamber of Commerce. Who asked for them to have such a troublesome emperor?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master has really gotten injured?” Xu Sanniang couldn’t help but ask again after giving her subordinate instructions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan swept a glance at her, then pulled Feng Yunhuan down from the carriage. “Find someone to tie him up and lock him away. He must be tied up tightly. This person is full of craft and cunning. If you let him escape, then be prepared to see Master while carrying your head in your hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he paid no further attention to Xu Sanniang. He drove the carriage into the town until he arrived at a courtyard with a special sign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lifted the brocade tablet in his hand so the two door guards could see, then drove the carriage directly into the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan then arranged for people to help Tang Doudou carry Baili Yu off the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wanted Baili Yu to feel more comfortable so she decided to just let the men handle the lifting. She didn’t have a lot of strength so if she helped, it was more likely to do more harm than good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, right when she left to go, Baili Yu grabbed her hand and cried out pitifully,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wife, are you abandoning me and leaving?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was speechless. As she pried off his fingers, she said, “Be good. I’m heading down so that they can come up and carry you. That way, your injury won’t be aggravated. Don’t worry, I won’t leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge. She didn’t even know where this place was, where could she leave to?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention, she still had to wait for Baili Yu to help her cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance so there was no way she would leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu still wouldn’t let go and acted like a spoiled child. “No way. What if I let go and you disappear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silly child, do you think it’s a game?” Tang Doudou gave a long sigh and patted Baili Yu’s hand. She thought Baili Yu was just joking with her again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Baili Yu seemed to have become a completely different person today. He held on to Tang Doudou’s hand shamelessly and refused to let go. “Wife, considering the fact that this husband is severely injured, just let me keep holding your hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Tang Doudou didn’t know what to say so she could only allow him to keep pulling her. However, even after he was moved into the room, he still refused to let go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can let go now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not letting go.”</span><span style>“Baili Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s free time right now, why don’t Wife take advantage of it and help me wash up? Being covered with blood is seriously uncomfortable!” Baili Yu completely ignored Tang Doudou’s exasperated look and continued singing to his own tune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou covered her forehead. “There are so many injuries, the hell are you trying to wash up for? Can’t you be content with your lot and just stay in bed obediently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Wife avoiding me out of dislike?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s better if you just call me Doudou!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wife Doudou, can you sing a song for this husband? My back really hurts terribly.” Baili Yu knitted his brows in a delicate manner that seemed to say ‘look at me, pity me’. When Tang Doudou saw that, she felt a wave of revulsion and rejected him without even thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re in pain then just look for a doctor, what use would singing a song be? Be good and stay here. I’ll go check whether the doctors have arrived!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Tang Doudou finished speaking, she stood up and made ready to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a strong tug on her wrist and she was pulled directly onto the bed. Before she could react, Baili Yu moved up and caged her completely within his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A weak and low, yet still just as magnetic voice floated out from his lips. “Wife, let this husband have a good look at you. There might not be any opportunities in the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense are you saying!? Hurry up and get off! Do you still want to live!?” Tang Doudou wanted to shove Baili Yu off. However, when she recalled the injuries on his back, she couldn’t do it and could only allow Baili Yu to slowly lower his head until his lips were right by her ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doudou, don’t leave me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I won’t leave even if you beat me to death before the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance is cured!” said Tang Doudou, annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, a trace of helplessness streaked through Baili Yu’s pale face. He knew that this was what she had been thinking. So that was why she agreed to everything he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I die…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that you wouldn’t die before marrying me?” Tang Doudou glared at him. “As a manly man of upright character, one word is worth nine sacred tripods. It couldn’t be that you want to go back on your word?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha…” Baili Yu chuckled softly, then softly pressed his lips onto Tang Doudou’s nose. Tang Doudou bristled and immediately lifted her hand to slap him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before she even struck, he displayed a pitiful appearance. Despite his current ill state, his eyes still seemed to ripple like light was striking ten-thousand pieces of colored glass. A silent accusation was contained in those eyes. “This husband seriously could not resist upon seeing how cute Doudou was. If this is also wrong, then Wife can just hit me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he said she could hit him, could he stop showing her that expression?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t bring herself to do it at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes and covered her forehead helplessly. She seriously couldn’t do anything to Baili Yu right now. “Alright, stop messing around. How embarrassing would it be if the doctors walked in and saw?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s wait until you recover.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about I let you see your fill once you recover?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu seemed to give a soft laugh. He buried his head in her shoulder and she heard him say softly, “Don’t leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, I already said I wouldn’t…” Tang Doudou was at the end of her patience from hearing Baili Yu repeat the same words over and over again. As she scolded him, she looked towards the side and her eyes were immediately drawn to the large mass of blood-red on Baili Yu’s back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was so alarmed her face turned pale. She hastily pushed up on Baili Yu’s shoulder and shouted, “Baili Yu, Baili Yu! What happened to you!?”</span></p>
