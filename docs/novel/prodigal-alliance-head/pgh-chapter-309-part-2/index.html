 <p><b>Chapter 309.2: Flowing Clouds Palace</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Tang Doudou gave these instructions, she walked towards the shopkeeper and the waiter of the inn, then tossed them her embroidered pouch. "Take this as compensation for the damages done to the inn. If it isn't enough, you can head to the Alliance Head Residence to request for more."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She originally wanted to pull out a token or something, but then recalled that she had lost the Alliance Head Command Tablet and she didn't have anything else on her that could prove her identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin jumped over the railing and took out a tablet from his chest. "Go ask Plum Garden instead!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the Alliance Head Residence and Plum Garden weren't places that ordinary people like them dared to go!</span></p>
 <p><span style>These two sirs were truly making big jokes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the inn wasn't that damaged anyways. The shopkeeper had done business for many years. When he caught the pouch, he could tell by its weight that it contained enough to compensate for all his losses and extra, so how could he dare to ask for more? He even felt the urge to return this pouch to that Alliance Head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it weren't for her, not only would his business have collapsed, he may have even ended up dead!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head, I cannot accept!" After these thoughts flashed through his mind, the shopkeeper moved to shove the pouch back into Tang Doudou's hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin glanced over coldly and blocked him. "Since she gave it to you, keep it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shopkeeper wasn't someone of the Jianghu and didn't know of Blood Fiend Jun Xin's reputation, but he had seen the way those black-clothed men fled for their lives after hearing the words 'Blood Fiend Jun Xin.' Thus, he already knew that Jun Xin was very strong, so when Jun Xin looked at him with that cold gaze, his hand shook and he compliantly put the pouch away before looking towards Tang Doudou nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou smiled slightly. "Jun Xin's right, shopkeeper, please keep it. After that, please find someone to clean up the inn. You all must be tired after all this, so you should go rest."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she finished speaking, she walked over to discuss things more with Syndicate Leader He. It was best to tie these people up for now and then transport them to the Alliance Head Residence tomorrow morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she walked over, it was right in time for her to hear Syndicate Leader He cried out 'oh no.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What happened?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They commited suicide with poison!" Syndicate Leader He's face was pale as he inspected the black-robed people in the main hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knitted her brows as she rubbed her chin. It seemed that Flowing Clouds Palace really was not a simple organization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin walked over and said quietly, "You should have predicted and guarded against this. Since these people had covered their faces, they were definitely trying to hide their identities. They probably kept a poison capsule in their mouths so that they could commit suicide immediately if they were discovered or caught."</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of vexation and regret passed through Tang Doudou's eyes. She had been neglectant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin patted her shoulder and said in consolement, "Don't worry, it's your first time, so it's hard to avoid mistakes. Since you know that this is done by Flowing Clouds Palace, you already have a place to start investigating."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En." At this point, that was all that she could do. However, her goal in coming to Dream Mountain this time wasn't to investigate Flowing Clouds Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had Syndicate Leader He move the corpses to an empty space outside the inn and burn them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head." Syndicate Leader He looked at the large blaze in front of them and hesitated in his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Syndicate Leader He, please speak without reserve." Tang Doudou was also staring at the fire. People's deaths came so suddenly, like a flame being extinguished. A fire would burn what was left of them to ash and they would disappear from the world. Humans only lived in the world for a few dozen years, so why did they all end up having so many desires and fixations?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why not just live happily and simply for what time they had, then leave the world peacefully?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Syndicate Leader He couldn't tell whether Tang Doudou's expression was that of joy or anger so he felt apprehensive. However, he still said, "Alliance Head, I heard that the head of Flowing Clouds Palace is Elder Yu's nephew. Was Alliance Head aware of this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh?" She hadn't known about this, so she asked, "How did you find out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head, actually, I have a nephew acting as a spy in Flowing Clouds Palace. He was the one that sent me this information." Syndicate Leader He's eyes flickered. "The reason I came to this inn was because my nephew said that Flowing Clouds Palace was looking for something that would harm the Jianghu, and they had gotten information that it was in this inn. I rushed over to prevent it, but ended up falling into their crafty trap. If it weren't for the fact that Alliance Head had came just in time, I'm afraid..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's expression didn't change. "Then do you know what exactly they were looking for?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This... my nephew didn't say."</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of mockery flashed through Tang Doudou's eyes before it was replaced by an expression of gratitude. "Syndicate Leader He's concern for the martial arts community is truly something that us later generations should learn from. Once I return to the Alliance Head Residence, I'll definitely give Syndicate Leader He a public recognition award!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Syndicate Leader He seemed overwhelmed by this show of favor and hastily lowered his head. "It is this He's responsibility to protect the martial arts community even if this He must tread through fire and water. It is nothing worthy of praise."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Syndicate Leader He is being too humble," said Tang Doudou with a smile. "So that's set. It's quite late, so I'll be heading back to rest. After Syndicate Leader He finishes with these matters, you should rest as well. We can discuss the rest tomorrow."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Understood."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou turned around and called for Jun Xin, who was currently sitting in a tree and gazing at the moon. Then they headed into the inn together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once they left, Syndicate Leader He's respectful expression immediately darkened as he turned to look at the almost extinguished fire. A trace of confusion flashed through his eyes. Why would Li Xueyi show up here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou closed the door, then pulled Jun Xin to the center of the room to whisper, "Did you noticed? That Syndicate Leader He seems weird."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin didn't seem surprised and just yawned. "En, what about it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He said that he had a nephew working in Flowing Clouds Palace, but if he knew about such a top secret operation, then he definitely had a high position in Flowing Clouds Palace."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And so?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He said that the head of Flowing Clouds Palace is Elder Yu's nephew. This isn't logical."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin glanced at her with interest. "Why is it illogical?"</span></p>
