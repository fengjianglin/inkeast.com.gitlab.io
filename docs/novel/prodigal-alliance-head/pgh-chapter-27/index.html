 <p><b>Chapter 27: There Are Three Benefits to Transmigrating to the Past</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin left, leaving in such a rush that she forgot to even light the candles for Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou squeezed into the room through the darkness. After closing the door, she could not even see her five fingers stretched out in front of her, so she could only go to the side and open the windows. With cool moonlight pouring in, she was finally able to clearly see the furnishings in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was particularly simple. Other than the bare necessities, there was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't help but associate this room with the interior of Baili Yu's palanquin, which was also this way, concise and neat. It didn't match very well with that person's character.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surroundings were exceptionally quiet. For a while, Tang Doudou stared at the window in a daze, before she moved to the bed and sat down. Seeming to have suddenly thought of something, her pupils lit up and her lips hooked into a nefarious smile. From her sleeve she took out two sapphire gems the size of a pigeon egg, the corners of her mouth drew back to the point they almost touched her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such good things ah! Putting the gems in line with the moonlight to look, the faint blue lit up. Tang Doudou nodded her head in satisfaction and put them carefully inside the pocket of her lapel. Then her gaze landed on her broad palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>What in the world is this made of? Not even mentioning how realistic it looks, after wearing it for so long she didn't feel the slightest bit uncomfortable at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rolling up her sleeves, Tang Doudou discovered this thing's ingenuity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, rubbing her chest, she quickly took off the robe on her body and exposed her inner garments. In the cold of winter she could only run into the blankets before taking off her inner garments.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all the clothes were stripped off, borrowing the moonlight, Tang Doudou looked over her body. She could only see two pink little beanbeans on the flat savanna of her chest. From far away it looked quite real, but with a closer examination some clues could be seen. In the end the technology of ancient times still isn't enough, the veined patterns are not distinct and detailed enough, the hand feel isn't realistic enough...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cough, got off track.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tossing away the other things, Tang Doudou was still pretty curious as to how all these things worked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>There's no way Li Xueyi could wear this plaything her entire lifetime, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>There's definitely a way to take it off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking up to this point, Tang Doudou started feeling her body up and down, but couldn't find the slightest trace of anything out of place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That's weird!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>How come she can't find it?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly her eyes swept across a mark on her shoulder. What is this?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking closely it actually looked like a tattoo picture, like a fiery fox.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stretching out her hand to touch it, the surface was uneven. Unable to help it, she used her hand to lightly pick at it. Her face lit up with pleasant surprise, so it was here ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gently exploring back and forth, she lifted a piece of something that was thin as a cicada's wing. Carefully and cautiously, she slowly peeled it back, finally revealing the snow-hidden treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This membrane-like thing covered her entire body. Tang Doudou squandered half the day before she was finally able to take it off. After taking it off, her entire body felt refreshed and natural. No matter how unrestrictive this thing was, it still couldn't compare to the comfort of her own skin and body. After putting on her clothes and rolling around for awhile, she finally tidied up that thing. Looking at it, she felt a bit depressed. In the future, she must always wear this when she goes out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her little dumplings and her little jade hands all have to be hidden away well. Otherwise, if someone found out that she's a women, the consequences would be too horrible to contemplate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That City Lord in the rumors, was it possible that he knew Li Xueyi's true identity? Did he know that Li Xueyi was a girl? What kind of relationship did they have?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, was Baili Yu acting because someone asked him to, or just helping her for some unknown reason?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>That masked man in black, is he the Demonic Sect Leader Mu Ye? Last time he didn't succeed, but if they met again, would she still be able to escape with such luck?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would Elder Yu let her off just like that?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything of everything, she didn't know. She didn't even know what she should do tomorrow. If Baili Yu really refused to cure the poison for her, wouldn't she just have to wait for death?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah! Head hurts to death. Why the feather couldn't they just let her be a proper otaku girl, why'd she have to transmigrate here to this different world to be some Alliance Head!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from cooking she doesn't know how to do a single thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tossing and turning on the bed, the more Tang Doudou wanted to sleep, the more she was unable to fall asleep. Her brain was incomparably clear. Why not just make something tasty for Baili Yu to eat tomorrow to perhaps gain his favor? Once he feels happy he might cure her poison while at it!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such unpalatable snacks could even become specialties of Rutaceae Pavilion. She, Tang Doudou, has studied cookbooks for years at her house and was also a genuine foodie, no matter what she makes it should still be tastier than that specialty!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It's best to make something Baili Yu has never seen before. With the kind of money he has, only strange and exotic things will be able to attract his attention!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Doudou thought about it, she got more and more excited. She wished she could just climb up right now to go prepare.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But thinking about it,if she didn't rest properly and accidentally messed up, wouldn't it be that the gains will not make up for the losses?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forget it, first rest properly. Plan again tomorrow!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ha, and so she cheerfully decided just like that The things in Tang Doudou's heart came fast and also left fast. Thinking that there were things to do tomorrow, she turned over a couple times on the bed and then sleepiness started attacking. Her eyelids fought up and down. Not long later, the sound of even breathing in the darkness could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being busy half the night, the exhausted Tang Doudou finally fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The window was half open and the cool moon was still as before. No one expected that this night would be so endless, that so many things would occur.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the morning sun rose the next day and dispersed the cool fog. A single sentence in the Jianghu caused the pot to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In regards to yesterday's martial arts convention, the opinions differed. The focus of the topics, other than Li Xueyi, was still Li Xueyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This year-round gods appear and devils vanish* existence finally showed his true identity last night. Reportedly, he's an elegant young man, extraordinarily elegant.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">If you think about it, it should be pretty straightforward. Li Xueyi is hardly ever seen, whether someone tries to look for him they can never catch him, just like the ways devils flee when gods appear.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>But he was still as strange and arrogant as in the rumors.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The topic most worthy of mention was that Baili Yu appeared and even took Li Xueyi away with him. This subject could even be said to have trumped all other debate topics. Even the common people have all heard of it and discuss it enthusiastically over cups of tea and after meals.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In regards to this, Tang Doudou who was currently snoring sound asleep on the bed was completely unaware. The warm sunshine spilled into the room from outside the window, falling onto the head of the bed. The morning wind brushed past, exposing the Tang Doudou had slept all over the place on the bed and her unfurled graceful brows now contained a trace of a smile. Seeming to have dreamed of some particularly happy event, the corners of her mouth slightly perked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smack smack, so tasty!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice cream, frozen treats, sweet bean paste......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spicy strips...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Haaa....</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So spicy... so refreshing..." Mumbling that as she struggled to move her lips, a pleasure-filled moan spilled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light sound was particularly loud in the spacious quiet room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person on the bed suddenly opened her eyes, but being hit with the bright sunlight, closed them again. Then, she slowly opened her eyes again, stupefyingly looking outside the window, her spirit coming back.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meow ah, the spicy strips and snacks were actually dreams ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had already transmigrated, those things are already out of her reach... not happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Waking up the next day in this space-time, Tang Doudou reminisced about the spicy strips as she mournfully got out of bed. Looking outside at the bright sunlight, she cozily stretched her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the fresh and clean atmosphere, the faint fragrance of flowers diffused through the air and mixed with the sun's flavor. In a flash, the depressed Tang Doudou was full of energy again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>They all say that transmigrating to ancient times has three benefits; beautiful men, air, aphrodisiac!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first two she had experienced before but this aphrodisiac... Hehehe...</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin with evil designs. She didn't want to experience it, but if there's a chance for her to increase her knowledge (by peeping), she wouldn't mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu, if he ended up having an aphrodisiac, what would he be like?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imagining it, she was really starting to look forward to it a little!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The day after the martial arts convention, the Martial Arts Circles Alliance Head, Tang Doudou, got up in the midst of unrestrained YY*.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Unrealistic fantasies/imagination running wild</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally she was still wearing that layer of disguise membrane. After moving about a little, she straightened up her hair and casually tied it before heading out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last night it was too dark so she couldn't see anything, but right now, the sun was just right. Only after she got to the courtyard did Tang Doudou start to feel that Baili Yu was someone that had rather good taste. Every object and scene in the courtyard was amazingly elegant, there was almost a trace of Suzhou Park’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin has also said it before, Baili Yu likes quietness, that's why there are also not many people here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked around in a huge circle and couldn't even see the trace of a ghost. She couldn't help but suspect that the 'not many people' Qing Yin talked about meant that there were simply no people?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>And she also couldn't find where Qing Yin and the others were, so out of boredom, Tang Doudou started doing Tai Chi under the tree, doing a few repetitions of some broadcasted exercises.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"One two three four, two two three four, three two three four..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huuhaa, huuhuuhaahaa..."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she got hot from jumping, she took off her outer robe and hung it on the branch of a tree, then continued jumping.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Yin came over, she was just in time to see Tang Doudou jumping into stretching exercises. Her arms evenly moved, the rhythm natural as all of the movements flowed smoothly together. Adding in her chanting rhythm, it had quite an unique charm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>What school what sect's martial arts is this? So strange?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou still had no idea that someone had come and was still minding her own business and focusing on her movements. Grandpa had said so before, those fat burning exercises and beauty gymnastics don't hold a candle to the effectiveness of this broadcasted exercise. It can both temper the body and adjust the body's balance, making it so a person would feel more active and sun-drenched.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since she was little she would do this broadcasted exercise with Grandpa together, all the way until Grandpa passed away. These years, she had also persisted with it. Even though it wasn't as amazing as Grandpa had described it, it was still not bad!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recalling Grandpa, Tang Doudou started practicing with even more enthusiasm. Her palms and soles of her feet were almost about to generate gusts of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin stood not far away. Originally, she wanted to call her, but she was also worried about disturbing her as she practiced. So she could only watch as she practiced her eccentric martial arts and daze out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The garden was refined and peaceful, from time to time there would be the tinkling sounds of birdsong.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After exercising for a bit more, Tang Doudou became really tired and plopped her butt down on the rock bench beneath the tree. Rubbing her stomach she noisily shouted: "Why is Qing Yin still not here, I'm about to starve to death!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her blameful look as she pouted, it was even more cutely sweet and charming than some girls. Qing Yin couldn't help but lightly sigh, if this was really a woman it'd be perfect.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>." Seeing that Tang Doudou’s plaintive complaints towards her was about to expand and float to far reaches, Qing Yin cast a glance at the food in her hands and softly called.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Qing Yin's clear spring voice, Tang Doudou immediately bounced up and turned around to see Qing Yin who was approaching, walking on lotus flowers while wearing a water blue cheongsam.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Li</span><i><span style> gongzi </span></i><span style>hungry?” Qing Yin approached and took the food一一and arranged it on the stone table: “These are all famous breakfast items of Huai City. Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> try tasting it and see if it palatable. If it isn’t, Qing Yin will call for someone to bring something different.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the plates of delicate breakfast items on the stone table, Tang Doudou, who was already hungry to the point her chest was sticking to her back, didn’t have the mind to care whether it was palatable or not. She reached out and picked up a piece of osmanthus flower cake and put it into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei pei pei!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant after she placed it into her mouth Tang Doudou immediately spat it out. Her facial color was queer as she looked at the remaining half of the cake in her hand. How does this even count as an osmanthus flower cake!? It doesn’t even has the taste of osmanthus flowers! It’s filled with a strange odor that’s sweet to the point of emitting greasiness! The taste was also not meticulous enough. It’s too lacking, way too lacking!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Yin, are you sure these are all Huai City’s most famous delicacies?” Tang Doudou put down the cake in her hand. Even though she was really hungry, but as the bone ash level* foodie of the foodie world, she simply could not choke this strange tasting osmanthus flower cake down.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">”Bone ash level” is a term often used in online game chats. A self-pronounced ‘bone ash level’ player feels that he has a very high level of achievement, and is very experienced.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>This reaction of Tang Doudou’s caused Qing Yin to be a bit annoyed. Even if the thing doesn’t fit his taste he shouldn’t spit it out in front of her face. Whatever the case, for this breakfast she has put in some thought and effort because she wanted to satisfy Li Xueyi and make it so that he’d have less complaints towards Master. </span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never expected that he would actually be this ungrateful!</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">In my experience, when you’re super awake late in the night, the ideas that hit are super dangerous because they’re half genius and half you-will-definitely-regret-it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #800080;">MP: I definitely agree, I’ve had some of the most amazing ideas in that state. Things I would never think about while clear-headed. I just wish I had the mind to write them down. In the morning half of them were just a jumbled mess that I couldn’t make much out of....</span></p>
