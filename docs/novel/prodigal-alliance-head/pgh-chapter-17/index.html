 <p><b>Chapter 17: Alliance Head's Golden Mouth </b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn't be summed up merely by the word chaotic.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The parties tore into each other, tearing as if it were a joy. Rather, it was her, the main subject that sat at the side enjoying the show while cracking melons seeds between her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mother Mo Yun*, whether this saying is true or not, you and I both know in our hearts. Why must you deceive others and yourself?" Xiao Yiyun looked towards Mo Yun, his expression particularly disdainful.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">The ways to refer to a nun is either Sister or Mother in English. I'm assuming she's an older women because it's 师太</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The hand Mo Yun pointed at him trembled and shook. With a bang she slammed it on the table next to her and the wooden table immediately cracked and splintered, accompanying her voice that was practically spitting anger: "Even though the City Lord has to give a separate explanation on this matter with Li Xueyi, but you guys shouldn't forget about all that heart's blood the City Lord put out for the community of martial artists!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smack smack. Looks like this Mo Yun is a supporter of the City Lord of Cloud City.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person's not bad ah, she separates the crooked and the straight pretty well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou grabbed some of the snacks placed next to her and dashingly threw it into her mouth. After smashing and chewing for a few bites, she suddenly felt something wasn't right.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This flavor is way too strange!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei pei pei! She quickly spat it out and picked up the cup next to her, taking a large gulp. Out of the corner of her eyes, she show Bai Feiyun stare at her with a face of misgivings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's a bit unpalatable." Tang Doudou pointed to the plate next to her and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun glanced at the dried fruit in that plate and said a bit unhappily: "This snack is the specialty of Rutaceae Pavilion. It's something that you usually wouldn't be able to eat even if you wanted to, when it comes to your mouth how did it end up becoming unpalatable?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Something like this can be counted as a specialty?" As a local delicacies foodie, Tang Doudou expressed that she begged to differ. Her tone of disdain reached the extreme and she completely didn't notice Bai Feiyun's expression turning more and more ugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since Alliance Head feels it's unfit to enter your golden mouth, then just don't eat it." Bai Feiyun stretched out his hand and swept the small plate onto the ground. With a 'palala' it shattered into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice was not loud but it was also not soft. It happened to be just after Mo Yun got angry and a brief period of silence had appeared in the hall so everyone heard this clear as crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alliance Head......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu's sharp gaze froze for a moment before immediately sweeping over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's hand trembled for a moment and the expression of calm on her face almost collapsed, but luckily, she had always been thick-skinned. Immediately she returned his gaze without the slightest hint of fear, looking back at Elder Yu with an arrogant provoking expression. A complete scene of Li Xueyi is precisely this daddy, this daddy is precisely Li Xueyi. This daddy is the Alliance Head, what can an old thing like you do to me?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as expected, the beard that covered Elder Yu's entire face jumped a few jumps. Li Xueyi had actually been in the hall for so long and he had no idea. No wonder Bai Feiyun didn't react at all to Xiao Yiyun's provocations, no wonder, no wonder......</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Calming down his frame of mind, Elder Yu pulled his face into a smile: "Didn't think that Alliance Head had already arrived long ago, I thought......"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thought what? Thought this Alliance Head was disposed of just by those couple scamps from the Demonic Sect?" Since she had been pushed out, she definitely could not show weakness. Otherwise, there's no way this crowd of people would just let her off?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just from what these people said earlier she already knew that she must wade through this muddy water*!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">A saying that's like, she can't get out and clean herself even if she wants to, so she'll just have to be resolute and work through the situation.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Who asked her to be wearing Li Xueyi's corporeal body?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment she was pushed out by Bai Feiyun, Li Xueyi was her, she was precisely Li Xueyi!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She must sort out this mess, otherwise even if she was lucky enough to walk out of this Rutaceae Pavilion today, the outside, as large of a sky and earth as it has, is completely inside this Jianghu pot. A small fry like her will be eaten sooner or later, without even a bone left!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that Bai Feiyun still didn't make a single sound. He didn't even give her a slightest bit of warning before pushing her out which made Tang Doudou a little bit disappointed. She originally thought that she could become good friends with him. After all, Bai Feiyun was the first person to help her ever since she arrived here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gathering up her thoughts, Tang Doudou stood up and walked step by step towards the center stage of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the flames of the flickering candles, the young man's white garment was like snow. Arrogantly aglow with health and vigor, his hair lightly floated along his figure, a simple headband tied the hair up. The candlelight penetrated through the gauze clothes and casted a glazed light, which contrasted with the youngster's face to give off an enchanting radiance. His petal lips slightly rose up, light illuminated his eyelashes, dyeing them in a slight sunrise-like glow. Nodding, the smiling expression in his eyes gradually became stronger, from the start until now, his gaze containing a provocation never left Elder Yu's face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #008000;">Credits: Translated by Chiyomira, Edited by Ocelot</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">[Chiyomira's Corner]</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">In the last paragraph, all those 'he's were added by me. It's describing Tang Doudou, but since they don't know he's actually a 'she', I decided to use 'he's. Would you believe that from the start to the end of that paragraph there was not a single 'he' or 'she'? Because there wasn't. And there was only a total of one period as well. Chinese literature is like Shakespeare.</span></p>
