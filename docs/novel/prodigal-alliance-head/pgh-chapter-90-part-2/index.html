 <p><b>Chapter 90.2: Yuner</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>There’s someone inside the room?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily looked over and saw a familiar person curled up in the corner. His clear pupils were filled with restrained fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t this the foolish little kid she encountered in the Bai Residence?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s you?” Tang Doudou was stunned for a moment before she started looking around. Could it be that after half the day, they still hadn’t left the Bai Residence?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner seemed to recognize Tang Doudou and exposed an excited smile. “Be-beautiful Big Brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Uh...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked at her chest. Da fudge, what part of her seems like a big brother?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she couldn’t be bothered to care much about this for now. She lifted her hand and asked Yuner, “Can you help out with something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful Big Brother, what is it!?” Yuner was no longer afraid when he realized it was someone he knew. He hopped off the bed and walked to Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can Yuner help Big Brother carry him onto the bed?” This child seemed a little slow in his reactions, but basic communications weren’t a problem. She didn’t know where this place was, so she could only work on saving Baili Yu first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Baili Yu’s body temperature was still dropping and his breathing was weak to the point of being almost imperceptible, his heart was still pounding strongly. This was what allowed Tang Doudou to calm down a little. She had heard Bai Feiyun say earlier that Baili Yu had an illness and by the sound of it, it was quite a serious illness. She didn’t find any injuries on Baili Yu when she examined him earlier so this abnormal situation was probably his illness acting up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t a doctor so she definitely didn’t have any methods to treat Baili Yu. Thus, she could only find a place for Baili Yu to rest before she headed back to the Plum Garden to get help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner swept a glance at Baili Yu who was sprawled on the ground and a stunned expression flashed through his eyes. He gave a heartfelt sigh. “This Big Sister is even prettier than Big Sister San Yu…”<sup>E/C</sup></span></p>
 <p><span style>Wat’s dat?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that this child still doesn’t know how to distinguish gender properly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, he knows San Yu? From his tone, he seems to depend on her quite a bit. Looks like they were actually quite familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou and Yuner had to work together in order to move Baili Yu onto the bed. Unexpectedly, Baili Yu, who looked pretty skinny, was actually this heavy. By the time they finished carrying him over, they were both covered with sweat. As Tang Doudou sat with Yuner, she asked, “Yuner, are you tired?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not tired, Yuner’s not tired.” Yuner beamed as he gazed at Tang Doudou. “Beautiful Big Brother, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When this was brought up, Tang Doudou suddenly recalled something. “That’s right, Yuner, is this still the Bai Residence?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not ah, this is Beautiful Big Sister’s house.” Yuner blinked innocently. “Beautiful Big Brother, what are you asking this for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful Big Sister?” Tang Doudou swept a glance at Baili Yu. “Are you talking about San Yu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, it’s Big Sister San Yu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you on really good terms with her?” She wanted to have Yuner help guard Baili Yu so it was better to know more. That way, she could feel more at ease when she left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner nodded. “Big Sister San Yu is Yuner’s bestest friend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like that ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful Big Brother, do you have something you want Yuner to help with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh, this child is so, sooo cute…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you know?” Tang Doudou asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner had on a expression of ‘Big Brother, you’re really dumb ah’. “It’s hanging all over your face. Yuner can tell with one glance ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoyo, and she was saying this child was dumb. How was this child dumb at all?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou scratched her head. “Then do you know what I want you to help with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful Big Brother wants Yuner to look after Beautiful Big Sister, right?” Yuner’s tone which was as innocent as before stunned Tang Doudou. It was very obvious to see that she needed help but being able to tell what she needed help with wasn’t easy at all. He was actually able to tell exactly what she wanted, this was way too unexpected!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Tang Doudou stare blankly, Yuner scratched the back of his head, a little embarrassed. “Beautiful Big Brother doesn’t need to feel curious. Yuner is stupid but can guess the thoughts of others really accurately…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely because of this that he was disliked by Mother, Daddy and the others. They say that he doesn’t know how to conduct himself in society and didn’t understand rules.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said so? How is Yuner dumb at all?” Tang Doudou patted his shoulder. “Yuner is capable of understanding people’s hearts. This is something that most people can’t even do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful Big Sister had said that before too!” When Yuner heard this, his completely pure eyes lit up and he looked with pleasant surprise towards Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and became rather curious about San Yu. What kind of person is that young girl?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had insisted on winning that cooking competition; what did she want to obtain that promise from the Prime Minister for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou originally wanted to ask Yuner, but she saw that Baili Yu’s condition seemed severe and was worried that it would get worse. Hence, she stood up. “Yuner, I’m going to find someone to save him. I’ll have to trouble you to help me look after him for a bit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yuner exposed a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The roof here is broken. After Big Sister San Yu returns, she’ll definitely come here to investigate. If she sees this Big Sister on the bed, she’ll definitely get angry. Big Sister San Yu doesn’t like strangers coming into her home. So…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before Big Sister San Yu comes back, Yuner will help Big Brother carry her somewhere else!” Yuner looked hopefully towards Tang Doudou, hoping that she would accept his idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou also really wanted to accept. However, she hesitated, thinking about Baili Yu’s condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she was hesitating, the sound of a door being opened came from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Creak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuner, are you inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was San Yu’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou and Yuner shared a glance. Yuner immediately became flustered and his eyes were completely at a loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go outside and talk to Big Sister San Yu!” He gritted his teeth and stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, don’t!” Tang Doudou hastily stopped him. “It’s better if I go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I met her earlier in the Bai Residence, it’ll be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pressed down on his shoulder. “Yuner, I’ll have to trouble you to look after him, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, alright…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner nodded. “Then, when you head out, don’t start arguing with Big Sister San Yu no matter what, alright? In reality, Big Sister San Yu is really good at heart. She just doesn’t like interacting with strangers. You have to talk to her properly. She’ll definitely agree,” said Yuner sincerely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuner, are you inside? What happened to the roof…” San Yu walked into the courtyard from the entrance, before walking from the courtyard towards this direction probably because she had noticed the collapsed roof. When she didn’t hear Yuner’s reply after a long time, she thought something had happened to Yuner and immediately started running.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She reached the room in a few steps. Just as she was about to push open the door and enter, the door opened from the inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s you!”</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">E/C - “This Big Sister is even prettier than Big Sister San Yu…” so San Yu is flat?? plus more masculine = prettier? i can't comprehend this level of gender bending…</span></span></p>
 <p>C: Nah, I think it’s more like Baili Yu is beautiful in a way that can be androgynous? Like this ‘ancient chinese guy’ is more beautiful than me.</p>
