 <p><b>Chapter 303.1: Find a Man for Sister-in-Law</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Both of you are Big Brother's subordinates, so what right does Jun Xin have to give you orders? Feng Long, you should come up with a better excuse!" When Jun Xin was brought up, Baili Yiling became irritated again. Although she had been busy, every time she had breathing room she would try to visit Sister-in-Law. However, every time she tried, she'd either be stopped by Feng Long, or barred from the courtyard by Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Long's expression didn't change. "Although both of us are Master's subordinates, Young Master Jun is also Master's junior brother. This subordinate does not dare to disobey his words!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But I'm Big Brother's younger sister!" Baili Yiling was determined to see Tang Doudou today. Even if Feng Long started speaking gems and flowers, she was still going to go. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, though Feng Long did exhibit appropriate emotion in his voice when he tried to dissuade her, in reality, his tone was unperturbed and unconcerned. He didn't actually seem to care if she went or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Feng Long saw that Baili Yiling had gotten angry, she inwardly laughed. No matter how shrewd Baili Yiling was, in the end, she was still just a young girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Girls ah, will be married away sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Long was actually looking forward to Tang Doudou walking up. Since the older brother wasn't present, the sister-in-law would naturally take the position of a parent. As long as Tang Doudou agreed to arrange a marriage for Baili Yiling and had her marry far far away...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Long started spacing out again. Baili Yiling sighed in exasperation, then headed towards Tang Doudou's courtyard on her own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jun Xin! Jun Xin! Get out here!" When she got to the courtyard, she didn't see Jun Xin, nor did she find her sister-in-law on the bed. She immediately panicked and started rushing around while shouting for Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, greetings, Eldest Miss!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Replying Eldest Miss, this servant is Qing Yin."</span><span style>Baili Yiling sized up this Qing Yin. All the people that had the surname Qing were head maids in Plum Garden. "You're the maid that serves Sister-in-Law?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then do you know where Jun Xin took Sister-in-Law?" Baili Yiling was just asking casually. She didn't really expect to get any information from this maid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, unexpectedly, Qing Yin curtsied and answered, "Replying Eldest Miss, Young Master Jun and Alliance Head Li have gone to Plum Garden."</span></p>
 <p><span style>They went together? Sister-in-Law wasn't brought there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling's expression was a little strange as she asked, "You're saying that my sister-in-law walked there?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Master Jun helped her walk over, yes. Plum Garden is cooler and quieter than this side so it's very suitable for recovering. Young Master Jun has arranged living quarters for her at that side so she'll probably be staying there from now on."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, I understand. You can head back to work."</span><span style>"Yes."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Qing Yin left, Baili Yiling narrowed her eyes angrily. Jun Xin, how dare you!? It was enough that you didn't tell me about Sister-in-Law waking up, but you even dared to take Sister-in-Law to Plum Garden so you could have her all to yourself!? How loathsome!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Rest up, I'll have someone bring your things over."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jun Xin, I'm already fine. You don't need to keep watching me all the time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou, who was sitting on the bed, was now awake. Her facial color had improved greatly and a soft flush had returned to her cheeks. Although she hadn't recovered to the point of being energetic, she was in a much better state than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jun Xin followed Bai Feiyun's words fastidiously and didn't let her out of his sight. She was very calm when she woke up, as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the calmer she was, the more uneasy Jun Xin felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, this little master doesn't have the patience to look after you. Rest up. Since you don't trust other people to get it, how about I go get them personally?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou forced out a slight smile. "You're probably just saying that. Later, you'll probably hide on the roof again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, how did you know?" asked Jun Xin in a curious manner. However, his eyes contained no trace of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Tang Doudou woke up, her inner strength became abnormally strong. One time, when she got serious, she almost beat him to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You can go. I won't do anything stupid."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can't. Bai Feiyun said that I had to keep an eye on you." Jun Xin's expression turned gloomy. It was fortunate that she didn't attempt to use force with him after that day. Otherwise, if she insisted on forcing her way out, he really wouldn't be able to stop her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Xiao Bai?" Tang Doudou humphed and her tone turned cold. "He had better not show up in front of me again. Otherwise I'll beat him to death!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"All he did was seal half of your inner strength. Is there a need to hold such a grudge?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"None of your business."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stinkin' woman, ever since you woke up, you've become uncute." Jun Xin sighed. "Everyone is just doing this for your own good."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't need it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then what do you want? Can't you just tell me?" She was already pretty much fully recovered. If it weren't for the fact that he was worried about her doing something drastic, he would've already stopped hovering around her. He didn't like doing things like surveilling others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at him with a faint smile. "You would agree to it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin immediately understood what she was pointing to and shook his head. "No way."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then what else is there to talk about? The only thing I want to do now is die." Tang Doudou gazed at the green leaves outside the window. Not so long ago, outside was a blanket of snow, and they had been warm and cozy in here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that scene was no longer there. The person was no longer here. </span></p>
