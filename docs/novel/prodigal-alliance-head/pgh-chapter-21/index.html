 <p><b>Chapter 21: Counterattack From a Dangerous Position</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu carefully caught all the little movements exchanged between Tang Doudou and Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sneered in his heart. At that moment, when Tang Doudou drank that cup of wine laced with Tendons Softening Powder, he had already sent someone to acquire the Alliance Head Command Tablet. Now, he'd like to see where Bai Feiyun would shake out an Alliance Head Command Tablet from. If he couldn’t bring it out, then don't blame him for being vicious and merciless!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, he wanted to directly poison Li Xueyi and completely get rid of him, but Godly Doctor Cang Baicao was currently present in Cloud City. If it were to be discovered by any chance, and if the Lord of Cloud City held him accountable, he’d have to accompany Li Xueyi to the grave. They might even dig out the private transactions he had with the Demonic Sect, therefore he only sent someone to disguise as one of the girls of Rutaceae Pavilion and take the Alliance Head Command Tablet. Whether he could be beaten or not, there was still the plan. Even if Li Xueyi escaped from Mu Ye's demonic hands, if he wasn’t able to take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet, he still can't ascend the Alliance Head position. At the same time, he could also conveniently influence the status Bai Feiyun had in the Jianghu negatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the plan was perfect, developments will always have twists and turns. However, in the end, it will still return to within his grasp. Everything will go toward the results he wishes for, so the earlier displeasure had already become of little importance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pondering to this point, Elder Yu's bunched up brows finally relaxed. As long as he was able to get rid of Li Xueyi, then he could have someone to expose even more ugly matters related to Li Xueyi and Cloud City. Henceforth if Cloud City wants to control the Martial Arts Circles once again, it would be difficult!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using some more methods later on, won't this Alliance Head position still become an item within his pocket?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had waited for many years already, so he didn't care about this small amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun already knew that Elder Yu had been scheming for a long time. Originally, he didn't want to push out Li Xueyi this soon either, but it's all that guy's fault for insisting on saying that the dried fruits he had personally mixed tasted bad. He even disdainfully said that those dried fruits didn't deserve to be called the signature specialty of Rutaceae Pavilion. In a moment of irritation, he called him by his identity. Otherwise, he would’ve just waited a little longer and allowed Elder Yu to reveal his true nature before jumping out and taking advantage of Elder Yu's panic to take control of the situation and introduce the person. At that time, whether he had the Alliance Head Command Tablet or not, it wouldn't have mattered anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, things had broken away from his control. After Li Xueyi was thrown out, he immediately provoked Elder Yu and even climbed to such a high place, attracting everyone's attention. Wasn't this just self induced embarrassment?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>He even thought that guy had some means to respond, looks like he overestimated him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, talking about Tang Doudou, how could she possibly know how complicated this time period was? She thought that as long as she stood up, this Alliance Head position was hers to sit on!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge she actually needs some Alliance Head Command Tablet before she can take the position?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It's seriously fraud! It sounds nice, Alliance Head </span><i><span style>da ren</span></i><span style>*, commander of the Jianghu, roaring big talk! In actuality, it's a poor pressured waiter that has to clock in and out of work ah! </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">"da ren" Sir/Madam. A suffix used for an official or a person in authority. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't the Alliance Head Command Tablet precisely akin to a worker’s card?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, she hadn’t brought her worker card and ended up acting cute in front of her company. Just by dropping her moral principles, she was able to mingle her way in and make up for it next time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, she didn't bring the Alliance Head Command Tablet, but could she also use the same tricks?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smack!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She slapped this unrealistic idea flying with a palm. Tang Doudou supported her head with her hand. Heavens my lord, shouldn't you use something to rescue poor little Beanbeans?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the tall stage, she could see everyone's hopeful gazes with just a single glance. Seeing this, Tang Doudou started to regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>For what reason did she climb so high, when she had nothing to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why isn't the Alliance Head saying anything? Where's the Alliance Head Command Tablet? It couldn't be that the Alliance Head forgot to bring it, right?" Elder Yu's grating voice once again sounded. The corners of his mouth tilted, almost unable to hang up the pleased expression over his entire face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Tang Doudou's teeth itched ah! Teeth itch!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This old SOB, she'll sort him out sooner or later!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's heart sank. Seeing that Bai Feiyun's face was also showing panic, she realized that she could only rely on herself to think of a solution right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Either admit that the Alliance Head Command Tablet was lost, or refuse to admit that she forget the Alliance Head Command Tablet to the grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou unhurriedly got up as she slightly controlled the expression in her eyes, she even dusted off her front lapel before she lifted her head. When she looked down and faced the entire audience, her expression had already returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Elder Yu is surely joking, how could</span><i><span style> ben zuo</span></i><span style> forget to bring such an important item?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, is that right? Then why is Alliance Head so reluctant to take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet?" Elder Yu narrowed his eyes into a curve. He didn't think that Li Xueyi would still hold on even when things had developed to such a point. He saw Bai Feiyun's helpless expression, it was clear that the mountains and rivers were exhausted, they had reached the end of the line and still refused to admit it. He really couldn’t help but be forced to give admiration, this person's face sure is thick enough!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Elder Yu is joking again. Why must I take out the Alliance Head Command Tablet?" Tang Doudou casted a sidelong glance at Elder Yu. He himself had also said that the Alliance Head Command Tablet was only used when commanding Jianghu, didn't he?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Starting this martial arts convention, everyone was just here to gossip, pat butts and chat idly, what's the use of a command tablet? It wasn’t like they were immediately going to gather people to subjugate the Demonic Sect's old nest!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Elder Yu simply wanted to make it so she had no way of being the Alliance Head! He had forgotten though, even though he didn't want it in his heart, but in practice every word he said recognized her position as Alliance Head. Since he'd already recognized it, the only option he had was to use his own palm to slap himself and say that she, Tang Doudou, was not Alliance Head, not Li Xueyi. Otherwise, this mouthful of Jinkela*, even if he, Elder Yu must hold in his tears, he must finish eating!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Jinkela is a chemical fertilizer additive brand a strong local flavor. They invited foreign actors to shoot some ridiculous patriotic video to advertise so it ended up being mocked a lot on the internet.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Tang Doudou said this, Elder Yu's facial color slightly changed. He wasn’t dumb, since Tang Doudou was able to think of it, he naturally was also able realize it!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, it really was lifting up a rock to smash on his own foot!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he wasn't one to be fooled easily, and immediately said: "As I've already mentioned to Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> just now, since Alliance Head had just arrived, not knowing the customs of martial arts conventions is also quite normal."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then may I venture to ask Elder Yu, who exactly was it that laid down this custom?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Naturally it was..." Elder Yu had just begun to reply when his facial colour sank downwards again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Was who?" Tang Doudou pursued her question.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu moved his lips, anger flashing through his eyes. His patience was almost completely used up!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The martial arts convention customs are all set by the Lord of Cloud City, isn't that so, Elder Yu?" Bai Feiyun finally saw Tang Doudou's intention. He really underestimated him, he didn't think that he was still able to discover this opportunity to live from within Elder Yu's words at such a moment. Looks like Cloud City allowing him to become the Alliance Head wasn't completely without reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu bitterly swept his gaze back towards Bai Feiyun and spat out the words between the gaps in his teeth: "It was indeed set by the City Lord."</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then that's right, ah!" Tang Doudou cheerfully clapped her hands and ran off the high stage to stand with Bai Feiyun: "Just then I was in too much of a hurry, I almost forgot about the matter which the City Lord had assigned!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What did the City Lord assign Alliance Head?" Seeing her fly over like a little bird that escaped from a cage, her expression seemingly wanting to jump and leap, Bai Feiyun slightly smiled and naturally continued her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou patted her chest and craftily winked: "Of course it's related to the Martial Arts Circles, a big happy matter that'll benefit the entire Jianghu!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that it was a big happy matter, everyone's attention was immediately sucked towards this topic. Tang Doudou walked down and got surrounded by the others. One person would pass on a remark, the other would pass on a sentence. They all wanted to fish out the information of this so-called big happy matter from Tang Doudou. They were curious as to what this matter truly was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where did they still have the attention to care about Elder Yu's matter regarding her being in possession of the Alliance Head Command Tablet?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who asked Elder Yu to have never questioned Tang Doudou's identity from the very start, and in doing so affirm it? Due to that, now they felt that Elder Yu was purposefully bringing up the matter with the Alliance Head Command Tablet to put Tang Doudou in a difficult position. It simply did not occur to anyone to question whether the person in front of them was actually Li Xueyi!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, when they heard that the Lord of Cloud City had even given Li Xueyi an assignment, they were even more certain of this person in front of them. It must be known that no one in Jianghu had such a nerve, leaving aside the matter of pretending to be the Alliance Head, no one would dare to create a rumor involving the Lord of Cloud City ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xiao Yiyun had spoken disrespectfully and even exposed quite a lot of behind-the-scenes stories earlier, they were all things that had been rumored on the Jianghu before, it was just that there were no definite news!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without wind, there cannot be waves, the human way of thinking was simply this strange. After getting used to being led around by people, they are ones who would follow the herd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Tang Doudou's words easily convinced them again without a doubt. The Lord of Cloud City was willing to entrust such a heavy responsibility to Li Xueyi, who would believe that these two really didn't have anything between them?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Li Xueyi was the Lord of Cloud City's darling, then they must take even greater care not to offend!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Xiao Yiyun originally wanted to expose the Lord of Cloud City's scandals, he never expected that it became an ironclad proof which ultimately caused everyone to believe Li Xueyi's identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing everyone's attention starting to deviate again, Elder Yu wanted to curse ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next to him, Xiao Yiyun's facial colour was quickly becoming almost the same colour as Elder Yu's thick beard. Giving a faint cough, he said something to Elder Yu. The latter nodded, and Xiao Yiyun took the chance to run off while no one was paying attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Tang Doudou was laughing along with those people, her attention never left Elder Yu and Xiao Yiyun. The moment she saw Xiao Yiyun run off, she sent a meaningful glance towards Bai Feiyun. The latter nodded slightly and also slipped away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally this was go block Xiao Yiyun's path.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for whether he can obstruct him or not, Tang Doudou could only burn incense and pray to Buddha, sending a prayer to all parties!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She actually quite believed in Bai Feiyun's ability though. If he didn't have some tricks, why would Elder Yu keep targeting Bai Feiyun? And also always expose a helpless look?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even now, when he saw Bai Feiyun head out to chase, his gaze swept over to her like a knife. Tang Doudou naturally met it fearlessly. The two gazes crackled in the air, in the end it was Tang Doudou who triumphed. Elder Yu lowered his eyes and gave a cold humph, then turned away and refrained from looking at her any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Small fry! Tang Doudou proudly humphed and turned towards an auntie that was tugging at her: "The topic is of great importance. The City Lord's intention is to wait until I'm steady before announcing it. So you guys shouldn't be so impatient either. As soon as this Li finishes settling the current matters, this Li will immediately explain to everyone about this! It will definitely be completely clear!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she patted her chest 'pah pah pah' in a completely unartificial manner, immediately attracting a good impression for everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having such a friendly Alliance Head was also pretty good ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, within them were also quite a few of Elder Yu's supporters that had not stopped giving cold humphs the entire time. From time to time, they still threw in some cynical sentences.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Certainly, Tang Doudou's mouth spared even less mercy when facing these kind of people. She immediately angered them to the point where their noses flared and their eyes glared, resulting in them displacing to the side to cool down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene was incomparably harmonious for a time. Seeing that it was about time, continuing to dawdle would probably only cause more unforeseen events. Thus, Tang Doudou extended her hands and gestured down as she earnestly said: "It's already late, everyone can go to whatever they need to attend to. We'll continue this martial arts convention tomorrow!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No! What is there that you can't clearly say today? So much that it must be pushed off to tomorrow?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right ah. There has never been the custom of pushing things to a later time in previous martial arts conventions!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that she wanted to end the convention, the guys that were cooling off on the side didn't even wait for Elder Yu's instructions before exploding their feathers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head, you've only just taken up the position and you've consecutively changed two customs. Are you not afraid that the City Lord will rebuke you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Or do you hold special favor so you can act as recklessly as you please, thus not having to take the Martial Arts Circles Fellowship seriously?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoyoyo!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Witnessing this crowd of guys that seemed to be filled with righteous indignation at the injustice, Tang Doudou gaped then closed her mouth silently. Looks like wanting to cleanly and flawlessly end this martial arts convention is really not possible ah!</span></p>
