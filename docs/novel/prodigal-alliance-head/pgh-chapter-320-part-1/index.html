 <p><b>Chapter 320.1: I Have Plenty of Money</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> felt that his looks were in no way inferior to Escort Xue's! The only reason Escort Xue had so many pursuers was because he liked to act noble and aloof. When it came to attending to guests though, who was better at it than him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, men always liked new things. Perhaps this guest had already gotten tired of Escort Xue and was out here for new entertainment. Escort Xue wasn't very amiable and often would face customers with attitude. What men could stand such attitude for long?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was different. His gentle and delicate personality fitted men's tastes perfectly. Even Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> had praised him on his ability to charm men. If he was able to get on this guest's good side, he might be able to take the position of being the best courtesan in Wind Cherishing House!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> poured a bowl of wine for Tang Doudou and offered it. "Sir, please try some."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't drink alcohol.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> then poured a cup of tea. "Then Sir, try this tea?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No thanks."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s smile stiffened. If this guest refused both alcohol and tea, how was he supposed to wait on this guest?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't be bothered with what Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was thinking. She was getting a little impatient since Baili Yu still wasn't showing up. "Why is he still not out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> saw that the guest was impatient to see Escort Xue, he bit his lips unhappily. However, he soon smiled again and knelt down by Tang Doudou's legs to help massage her legs. "Sir, actually, Escort Xue has always been very willful. He'd often make the guests wait for half the day."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou reacted adversely to Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s action. He was a courtesan, but shouldn't he still have some dignity? However, he was kneeling so casually in a such a fawning matter in front of everyone. It was unbearably embarrassing and shameful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She originally wanted to push him away, but since he brought up Baili Yu, she decided to take advantage of this chance to get more information. After thinking for a little while, she asked, "Escort Xue... seems to be different from the rest of you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course he's different. We all grew up in Wind Cherishing House, this place is our home. However, although our boss personally trained Escort Xue, he's actually not someone of Wind Cherishing House," said Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't hard to hear the envy in his voice though. Tang Doudou didn't continue asking about this in order to avoid arousing Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s suspicions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was already a good amount of information. It meant that Baili Yu had arrived at this place later and Nangong Yan hadn't been with him. This was probably due to the boss of Wind Cherishing House.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So the question was, who exactly was the boss of this place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who had so much influence or power as to cause Liu Zhiyuan apprehension?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was thinking, she started hearing music from the stage. It was a soft and suave guqin and reed music. The noisy hall immediately quieted down and looked towards the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two instruments combined in perfect harmony, but Tang Doudou could tell that it wasn't Baili Yu playing. His music always contained a sense of melancholy and loss that added an irresistible beauty which pulled you in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she realized that it wasn't Baili Yu playing, she lost interest. She picked up the teacup and used the lid to brush aside the loose leaves as she sat there quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> saw this, he became even more certain that this guest had already lost interest in Escort Xue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir, do you feel stiff anywhere else? Do you need Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> to help you massage?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at him. "Sit up."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh?" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> glanced up at Tang Doudou in confusion. He blinked his big watery eyes as he blushed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's brows jumped. He couldn't be thinking that she was telling him to sit on her lap, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wished!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sit down next to me. When it comes time to call out prices, make sure to do so in an imposing manner and make your voice ring out! Don't be quiet like a mosquito. If you can't do it, call someone else for me!" Tang Doudou didn't bother to even glance at Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>. She was thinking that she should've stayed with Xiao Yi instead. Although Xiao Yi also looked weak and delicate, he didn't act so horny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> looked like a complete bottom. His efforts at acting coquettish were completely wasted on her, this straight woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir, don't worry. I-I can do it!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hm?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can do it!" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> repeated in a louder tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, it can be a little louder."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can do it!" Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> spoke even louder. After shouting this, he looked nervously at Tang Doudou as if seeking approval from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at him and said with a slight smile, "Although you're a courtesan, before that, aren't you a man? Can't you pull out the dignity of a man?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dignity of a man? Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was taken aback. He was a male courtesan, how could he have the dignity of a man? Was this guest purposefully trying to make things difficult for him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he seemed troubled, Tang Doudou waved her hand. "Forget it, that earlier is good enough!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright." Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> smiled again and poured another cup of tea for her. "Guest, would you like more tea?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No."</span></p>
