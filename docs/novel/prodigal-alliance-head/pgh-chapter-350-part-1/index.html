 <p><b>Chapter 350.1: Take The Most Unexpected Route</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou heard this, she responded with her prepared excuse. "His health is poor, so he's currently recovering in Green Maple City."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Green Maple City is quite a distance away. Were you traveling on your own?" Xiao Siyuan seemed to be chatting casually, but every sentence contained deep probing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was made speechless. However, she couldn't bring herself to dislike this upright young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, I found a trustworthy group of merchants and traveled with them. After all, how could a woman like me have the courage to travel so far away on her own?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Xiao Siyuan nodded. After walking quietly for quite a while, he asked, "Aunt, when was the last time you came back?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's been several years. The roads seem completely different." Tang Doudou's eyes whirled as she quickly tried to figure out what Xiao Siyuan was trying to get at. What exactly was he suspecting her of?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Siyuan said, "It's been several years since I've last come to Huai City as well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stuck out her tongue at his back as she silently cursed. She had messed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Siyuan then said, "Huai City has been quite turbulent lately. Aunt, you should make sure to be very careful."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Interesting. It was very interesting. Last time she had encountered Xiao Siyuan, he was as stern and inflexible as an old man, but this time he seemed as shrewd as a monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin without saying anything. However, when she glanced down and saw the mud she was walking on, she immediately realized how she had given herself away. She was currently disguised as an old woman that was around fifty, yet she had been able to keep up with a young man without any difficulty on a muddy road at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone that was slightly observant would be able to notice that something was up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she didn't respond, Xiao Siyuan turned around and asked, "Aunt, are you not feeling well?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily waved her hand. "No, not at all."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment, she walked up to pull Xiao Siyuan and said sincerely, "Young man, why don't you just send me off here? It's only a bit more until Huai City. If you really walk me all the way over to the door, I'll feel bad."</span><span style>Xiao Siyuan's eyes flickered slightly. "Alright."</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his quick agreement just made Tang Doudou even more nervous. She couldn't help but feel that Xiao Siyuan was acting very strange, but she was more concerned about taking this chance to shake him off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she waved at him, then walked past him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she walked, all she could hear was the continued drizzling of the rain. Her heart was beating quite fast due to worry that Xiao Siyuan would suddenly do something to stop her. However, it seemed that she had been over-worrying since he didn't make any moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't help but laugh at herself. A lot of things have happened recently, but she had seriously turned into a scaredy cat. Perhaps he was actually just making casual conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li!" Just when this thought emerged, there was a cold shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stiffened and almost replied. However, although she had been able to stop herself from actually responding, she couldn't celebrate because she had already given herself away. Xiao Siyuan was now certain of her true identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she didn't bother to try and hide things anymore. She laughed, then turned around. "Xiao </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, how did you realize?"</span><span style>Xiao Siyuan had called out coldly on purpose. When he saw that she was no longer trying to pretend, his tone returned to being gentle like usual. "Alliance Head Li's disguise wasn't the smartest choice."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh?" Tang Doudou continued walking. "Please elaborate?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Siyuan couldn't see Tang Doudou's current expression, but her tone sounded very calm with no trace of frustration or worry at being exposed. It was no wonder that she was the alliance head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I received the news back in Green Maple City." After a moment of silence, he then said, "For the time being, it's best if Alliance Head Li doesn't go back to Huai City."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou heard this, she was shocked. This really had been Yun Hai's scheme!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn't let any of her emotions show. "Oh? So it's like that."</span><span style>Xiao Siyuan continued, "Isn't Alliance Head Li curious about who told me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn't it Yun Hai?" Tang Doudou didn't even pause to think about it. After all, who else knew about her identity? Or was it really as Xiao Siyuan said, her choice in disguise was poor?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was truly poor, how would she have been able to safely travel all the way back here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing that wasn't smart about it was that she had been so stirred up that she ended up forgetting about small details. It was these small details that confirmed Xiao Siyuan's suspicions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had been certain from the start, he wouldn't have asked so many questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought Yun Hai had spread the news about her, but to her surprise, Xiao Siyuan shook his head. "I don't know Yun Hai. In Green Maple City, I had encountered Senior Brother Xiao."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Brother Xiao?" Who the heck was that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I mean Xiao Ziyu. Does Alliance Head Li remember him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course she did. Wasn't that the seemingly dumb brat that was actually a little clever who had been with Nan Maner?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was linked with Nan Maner, it'd be hard for her to forget him even if she wanted to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how had he found out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. She moved closer to Xiao Siyuan and asked, "That Xiao </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> and I aren't very familiar with each other."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En. Senior Brother Xiao said that he had encountered you once."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then how did he figure it out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm not sure about this. However, he told me that if I encounter you, to make sure to warn you about not going to Huai City." Xiao Siyuan looked around. "I didn't link you to Alliance Head Li earlier either. Had you gotten off the Buddha statue just a little slower, perhaps I wouldn't have recognized you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The foot of the Buddha statue is at the very least two meters off the ground. It would be difficult for an old lady at the age of fifty to get on, much less get off. In addition, you shouldn't have been in such a hurry to leave. It's completely dark outside. No matter what, an old lady wouldn't travel at night especially when it was still raining…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more he said, the more alarmed Tang Doudou became. She hadn't realized that she had made so many careless slips. She thought that her way of walking had been the only hint of her identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lastly, there was the fact that you walked too fast."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En. Youngster, you sure have strong observational skills." Tang Doudou reached out and patted his shoulder. Light seemed to glint in her bright eyes in the night, then her hand quickly tapped past several points on Xiao Siyuan's chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Little Xiao ah, could it be that no one ever warned you to be on guard when an unfamiliar beautiful woman suddenly approaches you?" Tang Doudou tapped Xiao Siyuan's chest as she continued, "However, since you don't seem to have any bad intentions, this Alliance Head will just leave it at sealing your pressure points. Just wait for your brother to come to help undo it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she said that, she turned around to leave. Xiao Siyuan hastily said, "Alliance Head Li, you must be misunderstanding!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou paused. "What am I misunderstanding?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Siyuan hesitated, so Tang Doudou made to leave again. He hastily said, "The Xiao family would never betray the Martial Arts Alliance!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh?" Tang Doudou was surprised. His words made it sound like there was an unspeakable secret between the Xiao family and the Martial Arts Alliance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she was no longer that ignorant girl who had first come to this place. She would no longer believe everything that others say, nor would she believe that people would approach her without motives.</span></p>
