 <p><b>Chapter 287.1: You're Still Alive</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after she started running, the thing behind her began to move. She hastily glanced back and was almost scared out of her wits. The thing was actually very similar to the Black Demonic Nightcrawler that she had seen before. It was large and long, and there was a glowing part near its abdomen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was practically a carbon copy of the Black Demonic Nightcrawler!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she realized what that thing was, she stopped running and switched to flying forward with qinggong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She moved so fast that she left the enormous bug behind in a flash and there were barely any poisonous bugs below her anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did she calm down and rest against a wall. As she looked around, she realized that she had already forgotten which direction she had come from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jesus! It was such a mess!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just decided not to run too far away, but in the blink of an eye, things went completely opposite to planned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she couldn't remain stationary since who knew if that enormous bug would come after her? The further she got away, the better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had only walked for a little while before she started seeing light ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't natural light, but the dim hazy light given off by candles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would there be candles here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou carefully walked towards that area as she wondered, could it be that there was someone here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she got close, she discovered that it was a small stone room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room only contained a long stone table. There were two white candles on the table. When she got closer, she found that it was actually a memorial tablet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whose memorial tablet was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced around, only walking in when she saw that no one was around. She looked at the name engraved on the tablet and discovered that it was actually Baili Shuyin again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was astonished, wasn't this a little too strange?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced at the incense pot in the middle of the candles. There were still coiling strands of smoke rising from the incense sticks. It seemed like someone had just come here to offer incense and it hadn't been long since they left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would it be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't figure it out, so she started looking around the stone room again and discovered that there was a book behind the memorial tablet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A book?" Tang Doudou bowed a few times to Baili Shuyin, then reached out to take the book and started reading it in dim light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh? Why is it only filled with names?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was written in the writing of the Saint Tribes, which were Chinese characters. She could tell with one glance that all the words were names. At the start, she didn't recognize any of the names, but as she continued flipping through it, familiar names start appearing. Jun Yuner? Su Yi? Feng Wu...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mine?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou became even more puzzled. "Why would my name be here as well?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surprise didn't end there. Behind her name was Jun Xin, Nangong Yan...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu and Mu Ye’s names were also there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when she got to the end, she still couldn't understand who it was that had recorded these names, and what that person's motives had been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since she couldn't figure it out, she decided to just bring the book out with her and let Baili Yu take a look. Perhaps he could understand what this meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Baili ah, I'm going to bring this book out. Since the big evil spirit is your son, I'm sure you won't mind, right..." As she chattered long-windedly, she had already tucked the book into her chest. She then walked around the stone room for a while and discovered that there was a uniform cavity on the stone table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked extremely familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she took another look, she realized, wasn't it the exact same shape as her thumb ring?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking for a moment, she pulled off the thumb ring and placed it in the cavity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A 'kacha' sound rang out from the wall of the stone room. She hastily looked over and saw that the wall was slowly rising to reveal a pitch-black room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced inside and was about to enter when light laughter came from behind her. Her facial color immediately changed and she quickly hide that thumb ring in her palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lan Jia! Why are you here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that laughter wasn't Lan Jia's, who else could it be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked around but didn't see him anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia laughed again. "I really have to thank you, little girl. I've been searching for this half my life, yet you were able to open it for me so easily. Who would have expected it? Haha... My son really got me a very good daughter-in-law!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou silently cursed about her own stupidity again. The only one that would make a memorial tablet for Baili Shuyin other than the Baili family would probably be this disgusting pervert, Lan Jia. In addition, she had already noticed earlier that someone had recently offered incense...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why hadn't this occurred to her!?</span></p>
