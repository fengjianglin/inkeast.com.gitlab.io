 <p><b>Chapter 41: Bai Feiyun’s Crisis</b></p>
 <p><span style>Reacting a beat late, Tang Doudou’s hand froze on Qing Yin’s face for a moment, “Which Alliance Head Residence?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had already been seven, eight days, so Tang Doudou had completely thrown the Alliance Head Residence to the back of her mind. The only thing she harped on about everyday was the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly having this thrown at her, she really didn’t quite know which cloud it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin saw that Tang Doudou was completely at a loss and her heart sank. Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, as someone serving at Master’s side she had long heard of this type of poison and was very clear as to its toxicity and effects. Among them, the most mysterious and unsurpassable effect was the fact that it could wipe away memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t help but feel sad for Tang Doudou. Right now she was only forgetting some little things, but in the future, she might not even be able to remember things that had happened just a second before. To Qing Yin, it seemed that this would be extremely painful to bear ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though she thought this, Qing Yin was also helpless. She couldn’t even go to beg Master so as to avoid overreaching herself and angering Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jianghu only has one Alliance Head Residence, and that’s precisely Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, your home ah!” Since she has forgotten, what harm is there for Qing Yin to remind her again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My home?” Tang Doudou rolled her eyes, finally remember what the Alliance Head Residence was. After several leisurely days, she really ended up forgetting that she was still occupying the position of an Alliance Head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was it that came? They’re here to take me back?” Tang Doudou asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin shook her head and replied: “This servant doesn’t know either. This servant only knows that Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> isn’t within the group of people that came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Which basically means that it’s very unlikely that they’re here to take her back. It was likely that they were here to pick faults ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking to here, Tang Doudou’s eyes narrowed. Perfect timing! She just happened to be bored out of her mind so she’ll go see what these guys are up to!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really hoped Elder Yu came. Everytime she sees the way his beard flares up due to anger, she would feel exceptionally delighted ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re waiting for you in the Guest Hall. Master said to have you deal with it as quickly as possible, otherwise he’ll be chasing them away soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei! Hearing this, Tang Doudou gave a large eyeroll. Humph, what a great Baili Yu. His face is seriously as big as a plate ah<span style="color: #99ccff;">(very bold/unafraid)</span>. To take other people’s Alliance Head and keep him under house arrest in his own home. And now that the people from that side came over, if they stayed too long Baili Yu actually even threatens to chase them away? Isn’t that arrogance too unbridled!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin saw that she seemed faintly infuriated and hurriedly pulled her, “Let’s go, Li</span><i><span style> gongzi</span></i><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Qing Yin leading, they twisted and turned around the large garden for quite a while before they finally managed to arrive at what Qing Yin called the Guest Hall. Before they even got close, they could already hear an extremely resentful voice, “Alliance Head is just hanging around here. After staying here for seven, eight days he still hasn’t gone back to take charge of the general situation. Isn’t this too unreasonable!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another voice used that as a pretext, “Exactly! This time, if it weren’t for the fact that Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>got trapped, Elder Yu still wouldn’t let us come find him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was trapped? Trapped where? Hearing this, Tang Doudou’s steps sped up and in a few breaths she had reached the Guest Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin naturally followed closely behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were still discussing in the Guest Hall when suddenly they saw a white-clothed young man appear at the entrance. His facial features were delicate and pretty, glowing with health and vigor and showing a strong self-confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately someone called: “It’s the Alliance Head, he’s arrived!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alliance Head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of people rose up from their seats in quick succession and called in chorus. Only one person continued sitting without even moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou’s clear as water eyes swept past all the people in front of her. Her heart was very depressed, she didn’t even recognize a single one of them ah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this didn’t matter, as long as they recognized her, it was enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she thought, she gave a light ‘en’ as a reply then entered the Guest Hall with a tranquil expression. She asked with a mild tone: “What seek ye, sirs? Just now I heard that Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>had been trapped, what brought that about?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alliance Head, so you’ve finally come out.” The person that didn’t move at all coldly spoke. That voice was precisely the first voice she had heard when she was outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Syndicate Leader Xu, you should speak a little less. Alliance Head was only forced to stay here a few extra days due to his injuries, what’s more…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That sentence wasn’t even finished before someone faintly said: “I’m merely afraid that Alliance Head has been passing the days too comfortably and has long since forgotten his commitment to us brothers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke he cast his gaze towards Qing Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unspoken meaning was clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou coldly smiled in her heart but showed puzzlement on the surface, “You guys came to find me today for the sake of complaining? If it’s really like that, then you guys can just head back. I’ll look for someone else to ask about what happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expressions of those who spoke just now immediately turned rigid. They didn’t expect that Tang Doudou would be this direct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief period of silence, one of the anxious people immediately spoke, “Replying Alliance Head’s words, Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>and the Murong family were trapped in Qishan by the Demonic Sect as they were on their way to Cloud Sun City! The situation is dire. Elder Yu could not think of a solution which is why he had us come find you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were going back to Cloud Sun City? Could it be that Bai Feiyun already resolved that matter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly happened, first give me a clearer explanation. Why would Bai</span><i><span style> gongzi</span></i><span style> be heading to Cloud Sun City with the Murong family? And what happened with the Demonic Sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person spoke again: “The Murong family came to the Alliance Head Residence to cause a ruckus several times. Bai gongzi was busy to the point he was badly burned about the head <span style="color: #99ccff;">(from trying to put out a fire, metaphoric proverb)</span> as he had to deal with the Murong family and also, handle the large and small matters of the Martial Arts Circles in your, Alliance Head’s, place. For the sake of finding doubtful points in their story to prove Alliance Head’s innocence, Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>and the Murong family constantly rushed about between Huai City and Cloud Sun City. This time, after hearing that a witness who was at the scene was found in Cloud Sun City, Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> rushed there without stopping to rest, but unexpectedly half way there he ended up encountering people from the Demonic Sect…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually did that that much for her sake… Tang Doudou was very moved. Bai Feiyun ah, Bai Feiyun. She, Doudou, really owes you a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would the Demonic Sect trap Bai Feiyun?” Could it be that they had some bad history?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person also didn’t know, “It’s also strange for the Demonic Sect. According to the normal course of events, the Demonic Sect should have no way of knowing Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>’s whereabouts. After all, even though they had been active in the Martial Arts Circles, they had never dared to enter Huai City’s region…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke he looked towards Qing Yin. The meaning was obvious, because in Huai City there’s Baili Yu ah. As unbridled as the Demonic Sect is, they still don’t dare to provoke Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was curious now. Why exactly were the Imperial Family, the Martial Arts Circles, and the Demonic Sect all afraid of Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s even more strange is that Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>’s</span><i><span style> qing gong </span></i><span style>can be said to be unrivaled. His martial arts are also not bad. So unless it was Mu Ye that had personally acted, there was no one in the Demonic Sect that had a chance of defeating Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>. But as for blocking him, it also wouldn’t be an easy matter.” That person sighed, completely not understanding how this could have happened.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">轻功 - "Qing gong" is a sort of martial arts, the ‘light’ martial arts. People can walk on water and on air with this. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>But Tang Doudou understood it very clearly. How’d the Demonic Sect know Bai Feiyun’s whereabouts? There’s no other possible explanation but that there’s a traitor!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Originally, when this news came no one was this worried. After all, we all believed that Bai</span><i><span style> gongzi </span></i><span style>had the ability to escape. But against all reason, this morning someone brought a message. It said that if we wished for Bai Feiyun to be alive, then we must bring one thing over to exchange for his life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then this means that Bai Feiyun has already been captured by the Demonic Sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge, he’s already captured and you’re still saying trapped! Trapped your damned uncle ah!<sup>E/N</sup></span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou’s balls hurted<sup>E/N2</sup> dreadfully but her expression was still calm as before, “What do they want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This thing is definitely nothing simple and even has a big connection to her. Otherwise these guys wouldn’t have come here to look for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And to have even been sent here by Elder Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou narrowed her eyes, remarking in her heart that this matter was probably far from unrelated with that old guy. Hey, last time Bai Feiyun was still saying that he wouldn’t make any moves for the time being but he’s already made a move. Looks like he had also gotten impatient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Based on the news that arrived today, Bai</span><i><span style> gongzi </span></i><span style>has already been captured!” As he spoke he suddenly started bawling, “Alliance Head ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was shocked to the point that her brows leapt up. What drama is he acting from this time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must save Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>ah! During this period of time while you were gone, all the little and big matters of the Martial Arts Circles were handled and dealt with by Bai</span><i><span style> gongzi</span></i><span style>! Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> is a good person ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou naturally knew that Bai Feiyun was a good person. But, what’s he mean? Why’s it sound like she wouldn’t save Bai Feiyun?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why’d he believe that so firmly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unless it’s related to that item?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt like her estimate wasn’t far off the mark and asked: “Alright, stop crying. Regarding this matter this Alliance Head naturally has kept it in mind. You only need to tell me what exactly is it that they want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, all the people in the Guest Hall closed their mouths as if it was coordinated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Angering Tang Doudou to the point she nearly flipped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Really wish she could just gift each person an Ascending Sky Monkey and send them all to heaven!<sup>E/N3</sup></span></p>
 <p><span style>Meow a cat ah! To be blotted with ink at this crucial moment, it’s practically angering Beanbeans to death!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because she was worried about Bai Feiyun, Tang Doudou could only calm the anger in her heart and restrain her temper as she asked once more: “You guys can be at ease. The contributions Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>has made for this Alliance Head, for all the Martial Arts Circles, this Alliance Head knows clearly. Even though I have always been here nursing my injuries, but I’ve also been paying attention to the situation outside. I am very well aware of how Bai g</span><i><span style>ongzi</span></i><span style> has toiled and done many meritorious deeds. Even if that Demonic Sect wants the life of this Alliance Head, what would it matter? As long as it can save Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, if it must be given up, then just let it be given up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quite a few people became emotionally moved hearing this. They just knew that the Alliance Head wasn’t someone that would forget favors and violate justice. Look at the way he put it, even willing to give up his life, so what would a trifling material object matter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the contrary, Qing Yin really wanted to laugh. Even though she wasn’t at Tang Doudou’s side everyday, but she had heard quite a bit about him from others. Which day had he not slept until the sun was three bamboo sticks high? He spent his days so leisurely that he was almost about to drive himself mad from boredom, and he still had the mind to pay attention to the situation outside? Just then when she brought the Alliance Head Residence, he didn’t know who or even remember what place is was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she was just a maid. It isn’t her place to judge what the Masters want to do... She can only lower her eyes and quietly wait at their side. In reality, like this was enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that this group of people still weren’t talking, Tang Doudou slapped the table with a thump and roared: “What are you all still dazing out for!? Don’t you know that time is tight!? If something really happens to Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, can you guys afford to take responsibility? Acting so fainthearted and old-womanish, do you guys really want to cause Bai</span><i><span style> gongzi </span></i><span style>to die!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was thinking about their respective matters when she had suddenly slammed the table and roared. Seeing her furious yet imposing manner, they were shocked to the point they froze. When this Alliance Head bursts into rage he’s actually pretty intimidating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Replying Alliance Head, the Demonic Sect said that as long as we hand the Alliance Head Command Tablet over, they will release Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>.” That person clenched his teeth and finally said it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s the Alliance Head Command Tablet again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou really wanted to flip the table. Da fudge, if she still couldn’t guess the connection between all of this she should just go grab a brick of tofu and knock herself to death.<sup>E/N4</sup></span></p>
 <p><span style>This matter is definitely related to Elder Yu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But soon enough she felt awkward as well. If the Alliance Head Command Tablet was with her, she definitely would have taken it out without a word to trade for Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To her, the Alliance Head Command Tablet was just a completely useless tablet, but Bai Feiyun was a completely different case!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, right now, the Alliance Head Command Tablet is still in Baili Yu’s hands. If she went to get it, would he give it to her? This was really a troublesome matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was planning to give it to her--she had already be here for so long--he would have already given it to her long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t plan to give it to her, what is he keeping it for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could she have enough insight to perceive what Baili Yu’s hidden intentions are? She was currently becoming depressed when the guy that had been constantly nitpicking earlier started to sarcastically speak again, “For Alliance Head to hesitate this long, it looks like you can’t bear to part with it? Just then Alliance Head spoke with so much devotion to righteousness that it inspired reverence, could it be it was all just empty words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge, where did this Dou Bi* pop out from?</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">The term Dou Bi is in the glossary about a person that loves competing but in the end lost a competition because he got scared by the cold. In application to this scenario, Tang Doudou’s remarking that he sure loves to compete but he’s bound to lose.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">E/N - In this case, aren't trapped and captured the same thing? I don't understand her frustration.</span><span style="color: #99ccff;"></span></p>
 <p>C: I believe trapped usually means cornered or endangered somewhere. Captured means the enemy has successfully subdued them and brought them back to their base.</p>
 <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> E/N2 - So strange. Wow. Why? It's not like she got kicked or hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> C: Half figurative~~</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> E/N3 - That's funny!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> E/N4 - I don't think a brick of tofu will kill her, but funny. It's a pretty safe bet.lol</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> C: Yup, I stared at it for quite a bit too, trying to figure out how she could get injured from tofu. Conclusion, she can't~</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">I’ll probably be asking this from time to time (probably every 40-50 chaps) because motivation by the story mostly drives me to keep reading(I'm around 80 chps into the story), it’s really motivation from reader feedback that drives me to keep translating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">So after 40 chapters:</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> What are the main questions you have which are driving you to read more of this story?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> How hard are my edited translations to read? Are the jokes coming through?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> 1 - machine translated</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> 3 - broken English</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> 5 - simple elementary-middle school English</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> 7 - flows like common English fiction</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> 10 - it’s so perfectly crafted it could be written by John Steinbeck</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> Male reader or female reader?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> Any suggestions, love confessions, predictions or any other shenanigans?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;"> All questions are optional, you can answer some, none or all~</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">Oh, and I probably won't answer some answers if it seems like I can't answer without spoiling, so ask away and please don't get offended if I don't comment a reply~</span></p>
