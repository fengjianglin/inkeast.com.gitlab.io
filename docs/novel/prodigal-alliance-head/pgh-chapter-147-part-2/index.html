 <p><b>Chapter 147.2: Surviving Member of the Previous Dynasty</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Bai, did you miss me? I missed you to death ah!” The moment the crowd left, Tang Doudou returned to her usual demeanor. Spreading her arms, she threw herself at Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun’s eyes contained a helpless smile as he dodged her wolf pounce. “You’ve finally returned. I was about to abandon my duties and run if you didn’t return soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” In regards to this, all Tang Doudou could do was laugh foolishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun’s gaze then landed on Yuner who was near the entrance and he asked, “Why did you bring him back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Is there a problem with that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her puzzlement, Bai Feiyun immediately understood that she didn’t know about the situation. Baili Yu probably never told her about the unexpected events that had occurred after she left Huai City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He<span style="color: #3366ff;">(BFY)</span> didn’t know what that person<span style="color: #3366ff;">(BLY)</span> was planning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll tell you later. Since you’ve already brought the person here, then let’s settle him down first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I just knew it. Xiao Bai, you’re the best!” Tang Doudou eyes were curved into crescent moons as she smiled. She reached out to wrap her an arm around Bai Feiyun’s shoulder but failed when he dodged again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re the Wu family brothers from Green Summit Stronghold, right? When did you get to know the people from there?” Having asked about Yuner, Bai Feiyun then shifted his gaze to Wu Li and the others. It was clear that he was questioning to find out what kind of people Tang Doudou had brought back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Knowing that Bai Feiyun’s cautiousness was for her sake, Tang Doudou scratched her head embarrassedly. “When I was heading back, I encountered Golden Wind Jade Dew. It was familiarity at first sight, so I became sworn siblings with them. They were worried about my safety heading back alone so they had the Wu family brothers send me back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, it seemed like something had suddenly occurred to her and she asked, “Xiao Dao didn’t come here to tell you about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s Xiao Dao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After asking this, Bai Feiyun became thoroughly speechless and he sighed. Exactly how many people did she bring back?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Dao hadn’t met with Bai Feiyun?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or was it that he still hasn’t made it here? But that wasn’t possible! She had experienced the speed of that fool, at most, it would only take him two days to get here. Tang Doudou thought about it some more. Could it be that he had gotten into an accident?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s find a place for Bai Yuner first. After all, he is my cousin…” said Bai Feiyun with a self-mocking laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the matter regarding Yuner was brought up, Tang Doudou could only force herself to stop worrying about Xiao Dao for the time being. Hopefully, it was just that Xiao Dao hadn’t arrived yet and not that he had met with an accident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Bai Feiyun said surprised her. “I found it weird too, isn’t he the Prime Minister’s son? How did he end up becoming a beggar?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a long story. I have to start from right after you two left. Do you still remember the culinary competition at the Prime Minister Residence?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, she remembered. That was the day she had committed a very huge, vigorous act ah…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was probably no one else on earth that was audacious as her, to dare to kick and trample the emperor. She didn’t know how many catties of leopard guts she had eaten back then to have been that daring; whenever she recalled the incident now she would still break out in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end though, that incident was Baili Yu’s fault. His presence was practically more effective than several hundred leopard guts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, I remember ah. Could it be that it was that culinary competition that caused Yuner to fall to this point? That’s not right ah, could it be due to San Yu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seems like your brain got straightened out after an outing,” said Bai Feiyun with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou went 囧. It wasn’t that she was dumb before, alright?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just transmigrated over at that time and didn’t have a grasp of the situation at all. Even the most quick-witted person wouldn’t be able to utilize their abilities well in that situation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“San Yu is a surviving member of the previous dynasty. During the culinary competition, she had added drugs to the dishes. However, your involvement caused her scheme to fail. It was originally a secret scheme but some anonymous person had disclosed it. The emperor sent people to catch San Yu and declared an after autumn execution.<sup>T/N</sup> T/N - ‘after autumn executions’ were common in the past due to the fact that spring was believed to be the season of vitality and life while autumn was more austere. For the sake of saving San Yu, Yuner went to the Prime Minister. However, the Prime Minister ended up driving him out of the Prime Minister Residence and severing their father and son relationship in order to avoid arousing suspicion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing what Bai Feiyun narrated in a sympathetic tone, Tang Doudou was so shocked that she couldn’t even speak. Jesus ah! Then that meant that she had been the one who landed lil’ sis San Yu in this predicament!</span></p>
