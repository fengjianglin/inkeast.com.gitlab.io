 <p><b>Chapter 161.2: Killed</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Golden Wind Jade Dew arrived, it was right in time to see Tang Doudou being led away. Yu Fenger wanted to immediately run over and rescue Tang Doudou but Jin Longbiao stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fenger, something’s not right. Look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Fenger was very anxious but he still followed Jin Longbiao’s gaze and looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone he saw in the crowd immediately caused his facial color to undergo a great change. “It’s them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From the looks of it, Tang Doudou has already returned to normal. We should return and find Bai Feiyun before discussing what to do next.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Fenger was unwilling but still nodded. “Then let’s hurry and go back. No matter what we can’t let Xi Qiulin learn about Doudou’s identity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao nodded. “Do we need to contact Old Tang and the rest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For the time being, let’s not. They’re bad news!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they spoke, they headed back to Bai Courtyard. However, they didn’t find Bai Feiyun there. Thinking that he was definitely still out looking for Tang Doudou, Yu Fenger sent Wu Li out to find him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner had already been in Bai Courtyard for half a month. He had bothered Tang Doudou every day about helping him save San Yu. After he was finally calmed down and convinced that the matter wasn’t that urgent, he spent his days dazing out, crouched beneath the magnolia tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, today he actually ran over as soon as he saw Golden Wind Jade Dew walk in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B-big Brother Y-yu, B-b-beautiful Big Brother…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bother me!” Yu Fenger was in a very bad mood. Upon hearing this stuttering voice, his anger erupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation was already chaotic, yet he wanted to cause more trouble!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Fenger rarely got angry and in the past would often patiently talk to Yuner to ease his anxiety. When he suddenly got this angry, Yuner was immediately cowed. He returned to spacing out under the magnolia tree with a wronged expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a serious fool!” Yu Fenger returned to his room, feeling a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jin Longbiao noticed that something was different about Yuner today. He walked over and patted Yuner’s shoulder. “Yuner, were you looking for Doudou for something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao’s appearance was very intimidating so Yuner shrank back a little. “Y-yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could you tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to be scared, I just look fierce.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why don’t you tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I-I wanted t-to say t-that, Beautiful Big Brother was in danger. W-wanted to h-have Big Brother Yu help…” stammered Yuner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Jin Longbiao’s expression immediately turned serious. “How did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I knew w-when I saw Beautiful Big Brother yesterday,” replied Yuner honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao was stunned to hear this. “You know how to tell fortune from reading facial features?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuner doesn't know what that means.” After talking a little with Jin Longbiao, Yuner wasn’t as scared anymore and his words became more fluid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao knew that Yuner’s brain didn’t function very well so he didn’t force him to reply. He reached out and stroked Yuner’s head. “We know. Your Beautiful Big Brother has already been captured. We’re currently trying to think of a way to rescue her, don’t worry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing that Tang Doudou actually got captured, Yuner was stunned for a moment. Then he muttered, “How could that be? How’s that possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner’s voice was very soft so Jin Longbiao didn’t hear it clearly. “For the time being, stay in Bai Courtyard, alright? Don’t run outside, no matter what. Got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner nodded. Staring at the magnolia above him, he started spacing out again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao didn’t feel worried that he would run around upon seeing this and went to find Yu Fenger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou, who was completely confused, was being escorted towards the Imperial City. However, halfway there she saw a familiar figure in the crowd ahead of them and instantly returned to her senses.</span></p>
