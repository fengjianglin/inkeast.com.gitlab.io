 <p><b>Chapter 326.1: Was Taught by Me</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people outside kept causing such a disturbance that Jun Xin couldn't fall asleep. In the end, he angrily kicked aside the screen and stormed towards the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> and Jin Yi abruptly stopped arguing when they heard that sound and they looked towards Jun Xin in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where did this person come from?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they could react, Jun Xin had already kicked both of them down the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you make a disturbance again, I'll kill you!" Jun Xin then pulled Baili Yu inside and slammed the door shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glanced at Baili Yu, annoyed. "Baili Yu, your temper has become way too good."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu didn't say anything and just glanced at him before walking to Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw that Tang Doudou was still dead asleep, he smiled. She was probably seriously tired, to have been able to sleep through all that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin crossed his arms as he leaned against the door. "Back then, you would threaten me with Blood Satan just for breathing too loud while you were resting. But now, you'd just stand there quietly even when people were bickering at your door. Don't you think your temper's a little too good?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't remember the past anymore, so how would I know?" Baili Yu glanced at Jun Xin. "You're not going to rest?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am!" Jun Xin quietly set the screen upright. Then he remarked, "Something's off. That stinkin' woman usually wakes up from the slightest disturbance, so why didn't she react at all to that noise?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, he approached the bed while rubbing his chin. "I'll check her pulse."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached out to lift the blanket, but Baili Yu stopped him. "I'll do it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haven't you lost your memories? You still know how to check pulses?" Jun Xin glanced at Baili Yu. In reality, he had been skeptical of Baili Yu's claim that he lost his memories this entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had seen people that lost their memories before. Those people would often have a huge personality change and wouldn't remember anything. Some would even be driven crazy due to their desires to recover their lost memories. However, not only was Baili Yu unusually calm, many of his usual habits hadn't changed and he still seemed to have an impression of the people he knew before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he had first found Baili Yu, Baili Yu hadn't exhibited the slightest shock and had even invited him to sit down and calmly listened to everything he had to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, he had quickly come to a decision. Truly, aside from the fact that he didn't remember the events of the past, nothing about him had changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or was it that Baili Yu was too intelligent so his symptoms after losing his memories ended up different from that of ordinary people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin crossed his arms as he scanned Baili Yu. Or was it that it wasn't a normal case of amnesia?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Baili Yu was about to check Tang Doudou's pulse, but Jun Xin's stare made him uncomfortable. "If you want to say something, just say it. Stop sizing me up like that. It's uncomfortable."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin burst out laughing. "There's still a little that's different!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The past Baili Yu would never be bothered by other people's looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu lifted his brows. "You were probing me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I guess." Jun Xin walked over until he was standing right in front of Baili Yu. "Let me see your hand. I'll check you first."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm not sick, there's no need." Baili Yu decisively rejected it. He didn't like to be touched by anyone other than Tang Doudou. Jun Xin in particular gave him a feeling of danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aiyah, we have the time anyways, just let me take a look!" Since he had already suggested it, there was no way he was going to give up just like that. "If you won't let me take a look at yours, I'll go look at hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even if you refuse, I'll still think of a way to do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's really been years since I've tried to bully you. This really brings back so many memories..." Jun Xin giggled as he slowly approached Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Baili Yu had a chance to react, his pressure points had already been sealed and he could no longer move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin hooked a finger under Baili Yu's chin provocatively. "Senior Brother, how does it feel to have your pressure points sealed?" </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had also sealed Baili Yu's voice. Since Baili Yu couldn't talk, he just closed his eyes in surrender.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was delighted to see this and laughed mischievous for a long time. Aiy, karma truly did exist. Baili Yu had bullied him for so many years, but now he finally had a chance to bully him back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had already sealed Baili Yu's pressure points, if he didn't do a lil' something, that'd really be wasting this great chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, right when this thought occurred to him, he found that he couldn't move either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jun Xin, you crappy little brat! What are you trying to do to my big evil spirit!?" Tang Doudou angrily kicked Jun Xin away before moving over and worriedly asking Baili Yu, "Are you alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What could I do to him!? This little master isn't interested in men!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This little master was kindheartedly planning to help figure out why he lost his memories. I only sealed his pressure points because he refused. That way it'd be easier to check his pulse... Aiyah, you're too ruthless with your kicks!" Jun Xin hugged his leg as he rolled from side to side on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're so heartless. How could you do this even though I helped you all the way here!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou heard Jun Xin's explanation, black lines appeared all over her forehead. When she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was that Jun Xin with approaching Baili Yu with a nefarious grin, so she reflexively attacked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But... She looked at Jun Xin who was rolling around on the ground. "How come you can move?"</span></p>
