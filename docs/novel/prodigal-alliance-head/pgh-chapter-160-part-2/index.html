 <p><b>Chapter 160.2: Urgent Situation</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had asked the moment she returned why she didn’t see Elder Yu’s people. She was unaware of the fact that Elder Yu had already replaced all the people in the Alliance Head Residence with those loyal to him. It was just that his ability of keeping things concealed was truly amazing, even Bai Feiyun was deceived. Of course, he had used quite a lot of effort in order to accomplish this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was all for the sake of giving Tang Doudou a fatal stab!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he hadn’t been able to block Golden Wind Jade Dew today, no one he set his sights on had ever escaped his grasp, even if they fled to the ends of the earth. Elder Yu called his trusted aide over and gave him some instructions. That person immediately revealed an admiring expression and said, “Elder Yu is truly supremely clever in scheming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quit flattering me and go carry out the task! Also, inform Murong Ming that I’m agreeing to the deal he offered last time! Have him pick a time. The meeting place is the same!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over here, Elder Yu was thinking of ways to seize hold of information to use against Tang Doudou again. Over there, Golden Wind Jade Dew had almost caught up to Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>!” They saw that there was no one in front of Bai Feiyun, and since they weren’t sure whether he had been chasing Tang Doudou, Yu Fenger hastily called out to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun saw them and said, his usually calm face filled with anxiety, “I only saw that she had ran this way. However, she was seriously too fast, I couldn’t catch up. At the same time, I was worried that she would disappear from sight so I didn’t turn back to find you guys. Why did it take you two so long to get here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Bai Feiyun who had always had a good temper was currently this anxious and angry, Yu Fenger hastily briefed him on what had happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun immediately became furious. His warm gaze instantly turned cold. “Yu Qingshan, you’re seeking death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, let’s not worry about that damned guy for now. Tell me where Doudou went? What exactly happened?” asked Jin Longbiao worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her poison has flared up. She’s in a delirious state and can’t control her inner strength. It’s very likely for her to be in life-threatening danger so we must find her and calm her enough to help her suppress her exploding inner strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of poison would be this tyrannical?” asked Yu Fenger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun’s gaze deepened. He glanced at Golden Wind Jade Dew’s worried faces, before sighing and saying, “It’s the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the two would definitely be shocked speechless upon hearing this, but he hadn’t expected Yu Fenger to have such an abnormally strong reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Fenger’s face immediately paled and his body started trembling. His small eyes were currently opened very wide and completely bloodshot. He was clearly extremely stirred up. “Y-you said th-that, Doudou, she’s poisoned with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was confused about his response but he still nodded. “The matter can’t be delayed, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he even finished speaking, Yu Fenger was already gone from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun looked towards Jin Longbiao whose facial color was also not very good, and asked, puzzled, “Do you guys know something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao sighed. “This is a long story. We had better find Doudou first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he went to chase after Yu Fenger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people had left and their speed was faster than his. Bai Feiyun felt that he probably wouldn’t be able to catch up to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So he went back to the Alliance Head Residence. After making appropriate arrangements, he picked up his special medicinal box and left again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu took in all of Bai Feiyun’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming was also right next to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From the looks of Bai Feiyun’s expression, something has definitely happened to Li Xueyi!” said Murong Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu looked at him with disdain. “I already told you earlier but you didn’t believe me. You believe it now that you’ve seen it with your own eyes, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph, only what the eye sees is true. I, Murong Ming, never believe in rumors!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Joy appeared on Murong Ming’s usually gloomy face. “Many thanks to Elder Yu for telling me such important information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My information isn’t free, a remuneration is required. Murong </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, I believe you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope Murong </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> will send over the item soon so that this Yu could give you more useful information!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, Elder Yu, I’ll send my younger sister over as soon as I get back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, the ‘item’ Elder Yu was talking about was Murong Ming’s sister, Murong Jiao. The two discussed a person like an object without a change in expression as if it was as normal as breathing. They were truly inhumane!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even their loyal subordinates couldn’t help but silently remark that the Murong family’s Miss was truly pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Yu Fenger was anxiously searching for Tang Doudou. Few people in the world could compete with him in qinggong, yet after flying a great distance he still didn’t see any trace of Tang Doudou. He couldn’t help but panic even more. Could it be that Bai Feiyun had pointed in the wrong direction?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked around again. He even seized several people to ask them if they saw anyone passing by, but they all said no.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later, Jin Longbiao caught up with him right in time to see Yu Fenger kick over a vendor’s stall and move to kill someone. He hastily went up and stopped Yu Fenger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fenger ah, even if you’re anxious you can’t kill people!” Jin Longbiao pulled Yu Fenger to a stop and said tenderly, “Don’t be so impatient for now, alright? Let’s search slowly. I believe that heaven helps the worthy, so Tang Doudou will definitely be fine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jin </span><i><span style>ge</span></i><span style>!” After Yu Fenger saw Jin Longbiao, his tears started flowing nonstop. “I just feel really uneasy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The passersby were looking at them with weird gazes, but Jin Longbiao ignored them and pulled Yu Fenger into his arms. “I know, I know about it all…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Fenger’s tears fell even more heavily when Jin Longbiao started comforting him. He sobbed, “Jin </span><i><span style>ge</span></i><span style>, I felt really close to Doudou since our first meeting, but I never thought that she was actually, actually…”</span></p>
