 <p><b>Chapter 239.2: Let's Get Married</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, I've finished investigating the origin of those black-clothed men." On an embankment not far from the village houses, Baili Yu, dressed in fiery red, was standing beneath a mulberry tree and listening to his subordinate's report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They aren't aiming for us. They're only lingering hesitantly around the outskirts of the village because they saw that we had large numbers and they weren't sure of the situation." </span></p>
 <p><span style>"But I saw that the leading black-clothed man's attire seemed like that of the God Firmament Hall."</span></p>
 <p><span style>God Firmament Hall? Then it should be the Seven Great Saint Tribes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu waved, indicating for him to withdraw. Then he looked towards the house that was still dimly lit. Tian Weishi. They were probably here to find him. But what was the connection between all of this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Things seemed to be becoming increasingly complicated. It was just as Jun Xin said, every time they understood the Seven Great Saint Tribes a bit more, they would feel that the Saint Tribes were even more complex and harder to understand than before. The mist in front of their eyes only appeared denser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lifting his hand, he slowly pulled away his sleeve to look at the black veins on his jade-like wrist. Those veins appeared like sinister centipedes that pulsed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A conflicted look emerged in Baili Yu's eyes as he stared at his horrifying veins, as if he was making a hard choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the moon rose and lit the night with soft moonlight, Baili Yu finally lowered his hand and his broad sleeves fell to conceal his arm once again. He leaned back against the mulberry tree and slowly closed his eyes to focus on the sensation of the cool moonlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master, I really am useless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou discussed the Hoarfrost Poison with Tian Weishi the entire night. In the end, she couldn't stay awake any more and passed out right there on the ground. She didn't even notice when Tian Weishi left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she woke up, she found that someone had already carried her to the bed and taken off her outer garments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought Qing Yu was the one who had helped her and flipped over to sleep some more. However, after she flipped over, she realized that something was off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was someone here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's drowsiness instantly vanished when she noticed that there was someone else on the bed and she reflexively kicked with all her strength. Hell! To dare climb into her bed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, her leg was caught by a pair of large hands. A teasing voice came from above her head. "Wife is so heartless, to want to make this husband descendant-less first thing in the morning."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou immediately came back to her senses when she heard this voice. It had been silly of her. Who else aside from this evil spirit would have the nerve and be bored enough to climb into her bed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tried retrieving her leg but couldn't so she gave up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who asked you to climb in here without a sound? I thought it was some Deng disciple bastard."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu laughed, then reached out to twirl her hair around his finger and smell it. He then drew closer to the side of her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's leg was still in his hand as he drew close to the point that their breaths mixed. "Wife, let's get married," he said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou immediately rolled her eyes. He climbed into her bed in the middle of the night like a ghost just to say this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tsk. He wanted to marry her just like this? As if it'd be that easy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Get married?" She smiled. "Sure!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Joy immediately appeared on Baili Yu's face when he heard her straightforward reply. His eyes curved into happy arcs and he was just about to lower his head to reward her for being so good when Tang Doudou blocked him with her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of puzzlement flashed through his eyes as he asked softly, "Wife? What do you mean by this?"</span></p>
