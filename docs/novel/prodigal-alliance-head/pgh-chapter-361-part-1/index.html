 <p><b>Chapter 361.1: He's Arrived</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't try to deny it and actually admitted it openly. "That's right. I want you to let me go. I don't want to die yet."</span><span style>"You're sure honest." Ninth Uncle gave a cold humph.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou said with a laugh, "Why don't you reconsider my suggestion?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Humph! I only want you to die! Why go through all that trouble if your death could solve everything?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fudge! Seriously nothing gets through to this guy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou silently cursed as she edged backwards. She continued persuading with a smile, "Ninth Uncle, we really can just sit down to discuss this properly. It's not like death is the only solution to this problem."</span><span style>"Give up on your flowery antics, I know you're just trying to buy yourself more time so that stinkin' girl, Baili Yiling, can come save you. You should just give up! She'll never be able to find this place!" Ninth Uncle laughed coldly. He had already cornered Tang Doudou and now, was slowly reaching out for her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's eyes whirled and used her inner strength to dodge nimbly to the side. She rapidly backed alway in the direction of the exit of the cave. "If I disappear here, Yiling will definitely keep trying to find me. Even if all that's left of me is my corpse, she'll still find me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then I'll make it so you don't have a corpse. I'll make you disappear entirely from this world!" Ninth Uncle crackled. "That one-eyed fish in the lake loves eating corpses!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou recalled that creature's ice-like blue eye and shuddered. She couldn't even have an intact corpse when she died? Why were the Heavens so cruel to her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw the bloodthirsty playfulness in Ninth Uncle's eyes, she started mourning for herself. She wouldn't be able to buy much more time, but not a single sign of salvation has shown up. Could it be that this was really going to be her last day?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah!" Just as this thought flashed through her mind, Ninth Uncle abruptly attacked. His nails were as sharp as steel nails. Tang Doudou hastily dodge and kicked a nearby stalactite to use it to block Ninth Uncle's next attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ninth Uncle crushed the stalactite to pieces with one hand. As the stalactite shattered, Tang Doudou was also blown back by Ninth Uncle's profound inner strength and staggered back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't win again him, she had to run!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou came to this decision, her figure immediately turned into a blur as she flew out of the cave. Ninth Uncle hadn't been expecting for her qinggong to be this good. By the time he reacted, Tang Doudou had already reached the entrance of the cave. However, he didn't seem flustered and just chased after her calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou got out of the cave and didn't see Ninth Uncle chasing after her, she was puzzled. However, an instant later, she heard movement and her expression rapidly changed. She hastily picked a random direction and started running as if her life depended on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Ninth Uncle exited the cave, he stopped chasing and started making a strange call as if he was summoning something. The surrounding earth soon started rustling. Tang Doudou, who was in the forest, immediately noticed that something was wrong. When she looked carefully, she discovered that brightly colored snakes were all around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her face paled and she hastily moved towards the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right before she landed, she saw that the ground was filled with snakes as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely Ninth Uncle's doing. Tang Doudou's face was deathly pale. If it had been something else, she'd be able to deal with it, but she was terrified of these soft and wiggly things. Just the sight of them made her legs go weak, there was no way she could bring herself to make contact with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without anything to jump off of, she couldn't keep flying. Her expression filled with panic when she saw that she was about to land on top of those snakes. Suddenly, she recalled the torches in the chest. Snakes liked the cool and were afraid of fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hastily took out a rolled torch and blew it until it lit up, then threw it towards the withered branches on the ground. The branches immediately burst into flames and the snakes hastily slithered away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou used her inner strength and forcefully changed directions in midair to land in that direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only after she landed that she learned how truly terrifying her current situation was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were snakes as far as the eye could see. Although a bit of open space had been made by the fire, after a strange cry sounded, the snakes started moving towards the flames without fear again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou started to panic. If things went on like this, these snakes would reach her in a few seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after this thought occurred to her, she felt something cold on her leg, followed by a smooth and cool sensation. When she looked down, she saw that a small green snake was wrapped around her ankle. She screamed and hastily picked up a burning branch to push that snake off. She panicked too much, so although the snake had been pushed off, she also fell down and her clothes made contact with the flames and started burning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wanted to cry, but didn't have the tears. She quickly ripped off the corner that was burning up and threw it towards the snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The snakes retreated to avoid the flames, but soon flooded forward again. The dense crowd of snakes soon crushed and extinguished the fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw this, she was hit was severe dizziness and almost passed out. The Heavens wanted her to die, didn't they!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But no, she couldn't die! She wanted to be with Baili Yu! She wanted to enjoy the passing of the seasons with him, start a restaurant with him… and have a bunch of fat brats with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou's thoughts reached this point, she seemed to abruptly gain a lot more courage and her brain started working much faster. These snakes were clearly afraid of fire, it was that strange cry that was making them fearlessly approach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she quickly pulled down more branches from the nearby tree and made the fire even bigger in order to buy a little more time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was only a temporary measure since there were seriously too many snakes, the fire would be put out by them sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hid behind the fire. At the very least, she got a little more time to think.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many ways to deal with snakes, but they were all useless right now since she didn't have the necessary tools.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only tool she had was this fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how was she supposed to use it to escape?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a daring thought occurred to her. She was about to discard it when she changed her mind and gritted her teeth. For the sake of surviving, she'd risk it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She then picked up a rather large burning stick from the fire and with a quick jump, leapt towards the top of a tree. As she was getting closer to the tree, she quickly swept the branch towards the dense cluster of snakes on the tree. Those snakes immediately shied away from the fire and fell from the tree, leaving a temporary open space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou landed precisely in that space. Although there were still snakes hanging above her, she had no choice but to endure it as she used the branch to start a fire on the tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the trees in this forest had a lot of dried and withered leaves since no one seemed to maintain this place, so the tree soon caught fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She used this method to light the trees one by one. At the start, some of the fires would be immediately put out by the snakes, but the snakes couldn't keep up with her speed and the fire in the forest soon got out of control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smoke could be seen from a distance away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninth Uncle frowned when he saw and his eyes turned cold. She was seeking death!</span></p>
