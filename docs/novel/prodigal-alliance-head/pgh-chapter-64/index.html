 <p><b>Chapter 64: The Flavor’s Not Bad</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :(</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan saw that he was about to leave and immediately exhaled in relief. But before he could even finish letting his breath out, he suddenly saw Jun Xin’s brows furrow as Jun Xin walked towards an empty area in front. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What was he doing? Ye Chuan stared dumbly at Jun Xin without a clue of what Jun Xin might be doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But very soon, he saw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin had walked to that empty area, bent down and picked a serene blue gem out of the dry grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was that? Ye Chuan was slightly confused but soon recalled what that gemstone was. Wasn’t that the gemstone Li Xueyi dug out of the Chrysanthemum Glass Jade Palanquin the night he came to the Plum Garden?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would it be here? From the look of Jun Xin’s expression, he probably knew that the gem belonged to Li Xueyi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that’s also natural. Previously, that incident had sent the entire Plum Garden abuzz. There was no way Jun Xin would not know… Crap, Ye Chuan silently cursed. His expression changed abruptly as he glanced all around, as though seeking an opportunity to flee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Jun Xin wasn’t suspicious. However, after seeing Ye Chuan’s reaction, the suspicion in his heart was confirmed immediately. He gave a cold humph and strode with large steps toward the wooden house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Chuan wanted to flee, if he didn’t stop Young Master Jun, the consequences would be just as severe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Jun, Young Master Jun! You can’t go in!” Ye Chuan hurried over after Jun Xin and reached out to pull Jun Xin’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin’s eyes darkened. Without even turning around, he reached back and clamped down on Ye Chuan’s wrist. With a fierce tug forward, he threw Ye Chuan onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the fury emitting from Jun Xin’s entire body, Ye Chuan just smiled bitterly as he said, “Young Master Jun, what need is there for you to be like this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin couldn’t be bothered with him and just swept past him as he continued walking forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan was helpless and could only get up to continue blocking Jun Xin’s approach. However, the disparity in the two’s martial arts was not just a level or a half. Jun Xin sent Ye Chuan flying with a strike and warned, “If you block me again, I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has always been true to his words. Ye Chuan’s steps immediately stopped. He was still struggling with whether or not to continue blocking Jun Xin when he looked towards the wooden house. His eyes suddenly lit up as he cried with a tone of pleasant surprise, “Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At some unknown time, Baili Yu had already opened the door and walked out. The snow amidst the cold wind had not stopped falling, and the plum blossoms were also fluttering down with it. Baili Yu was only draped in a flimsy outer robe. His hair fell scattered in front and danced in the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin also stopped when Baili Yu came out. He had a bad premonition upon seeing Baili Yu’s current appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah Xin, you were looking for me?” Baili Yu’s voice was extremely languid as if he hadn’t had enough of a sweet nap. He slowly walked over as he looked at Jun Xin. “What big matter was it that required you to come over in the middle of the night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin tightly pressed his lips together without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan looked at his master, looked at Jun Xin and then glanced at the dark wooden house. Afterwards, he started slowly inching backward and concealed himself in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Baili Yu and Jun Xin were left in the open area. They stared at each other without speaking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, Jun Xin finally started to speak. “Are you serious, or is it because of something else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu laughed first before replying. In the night, the sound of laughter traveled very far. “What does Ah Xin think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin tightened his clenched fists hidden within his sleeves and gritted his teeth as he said, “I want you to say it with your own mouth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This ah.” Baili Yu spoke softly with a helpless tone, then asked, “What would you do if I said I was serious? And what would you do if I wasn’t serious? Ah Xin, does this have anything to do with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can it have nothing to do with me? I, I…” Jun Xin shouted at him. All of a sudden, Jun Xin seemed to have remembered something, his complexion immediately turning deathly white. He appeared as if he had been struck by lightning and stumbled backwards several steps, his expression filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re saying that she, she’s that person!? How could it be possible!?” Jun Xin rushed over, fixating his gaze on Baili Yu’s eyes desperately. “Tell me, it’s not her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah Xin, you’ve never been good at deceiving yourself. You’ve discovered her identity long ago. Even though you don’t’ admit it on the surface, your heart has already acknowledged it. Otherwise, based on your personality, why would you go watch over her every night but never directly tell her your thoughts?” Baili Yu’s expression didn’t change the slightest from start to end, continuing to smile as he looked at Jun Xin. “I’m doing it for your own good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want this kind of good! I don’t want it! I don’t!” Jun Xin furiously pushed Baili Yu aside, rashly pulling out Bloodthirster as he charged towards the plum sea. Red light filled the surroundings and countless trees toppled, causing the plum blossoms blanketing the sky to ascend violently in the dark night like a wild wave. Combined with Jun Xin’s angry howl, Ye Chuan was so startled he hastily moved out of hiding to appear in front of Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, will Young Master Jun be alright?” He shrank a little as he asked the yawning Baili Yu. From the corner of his eye, he sneakily peeked inside the room. All he could faintly make out was that there was a person sprawled out on his back as he slept on that soft couch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu gave a chuckle and retrieved his gaze from the plum sea. He then turned and walked back into the wooden house. “No need to worry about him, he’ll be fine by tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he closed the door firmly with a ‘bang’. The wind generated by the door slammed into Ye Chuan’s face, smarting like knives. He immediately realized, Master had also gotten angry!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this was only natural. When your happy occasion is interrupted by someone, it would be strange not to get angry!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan shook his head as he turned around. The wealthy circle was too messy, as a subordinate, it’s best if he keeps content with his lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was going to head towards Jun Xin’s side to check on Jun Xin, an attack abruptly approached him. Ye Chuan hastily lifted his hand to block and saw that Jun Xin, whose eyes were bloodshot, was already in front of him, panting heavily as he stared at the door behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dense killing intent around Jun Xin’s entire body pressured Ye Chuan to the point that he was having trouble breathing. Blood Fiend Jun Xin. As expected, that title was not in vain! Terrified, he looked at Jun Xin, thinking that Jun Xin was going to rush in to fight with Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what caused him to be surprised was that Jun Xin suddenly started laughing self-mockingly. The fury around him rescinded like the tide. Jun Xin then slightly stepped back as Bloodthirster emitted a light hum, flying from his hands towards the distance, stabbing into the soil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young…” Ye Chuan couldn’t help but call out when he saw a lifeless dullness emerge in Jun Xin’s eyes. However, before he even finished, Jun Xin violently vomited a mouthful of blood. It dyed the ground that was filled with plum petals and snow, causing spots of blood-red flowers to bloom amid it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face was deathly pale like paper. It was clear that he had suffered a severe internal injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan hastily walked over. “Young Master Jun, you’re injured!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin lifted his hand, ordering him not to approach, saying calmly, “I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell Baili Yu, I’m leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you going!?” For some unknown reason, when Ye Chuan heard that, he felt that Jun Xin’s ‘leave’ was definitely not referring to him returning to Plum Garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’ll understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin seemed to have exhausted the last of his strength. After he waved towards Ye Chuan, he turned and stumbled towards the plum sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan watched as his figure gradually vanished in the endless plum sea. He then scratched his head and looked towards the fear-inspiring Bloodthirster. Where exactly was he going?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why is he leaving Bloodthirster which had never left his side behind?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because he couldn’t think of any possible explanation, Ye Chuan could only go over and pull Bloodthirster out to scrutinize it. But before he could even take a clear look, a ‘ding’ sound emitted from Bloodthirster and Bloodthirster started to shatter inch by inch from the sword hilt, falling as shards from his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This, this…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chuan dumbly looked at the shards all over the floor and the empty sword hilt in his hand. He fell to the floor on his butt. Crap, it’s over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou slept until she woke up naturally. She stretched, then sat up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her brain was a little heavy from the hangover so she massaged it hard as she opened her drowsy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eh?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She froze for a moment when she realized the environment she woke up to was different from usual. The memories rushed back in a chaotic jumble.</span><span style>One scene after another appeared in her mind. Made fish? Snowed? Winter Solstice? Drank wine?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she seemed to have gotten drunk and walked somewhere. Following that was a pair of bewitching eyes and lips, familiar and sexy lips! It was really, really close. Whose lips were they?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When these three words appeared in her heart, Tang Doudou abruptly sat up on the soft couch, fireworks exploding in her heart. She, she actually forgot her morals after getting drunk and pushed Baili Yu down!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mah old Lord ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she thought of the things that possibly occurred, Tang Doudou felt her inner heart collapsing as she covered her head. Tang Doudou ah, Tang Doudou. Did you get possessed by the ghost of lust!? How could you have borrowed alcohol to strengthen your guts to dominate that seductive yao!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge! And the crucial problem was that when she was drunk, the only thing she remembered was moving up to kiss Baili Yu. She didn’t remember anything else!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frick, doesn’t that mean she suffered a loss?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei! It was definitely a loss! That was her lifetime’s innocence ah! How could it have been sent off so carelessly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she thought about the scenario inappropriate for children that probably occurred, Tang Doudou wailed and abruptly fell back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, when she fell down, a muffled groan came from beneath her, startling her. Tang Doudou hastily looked all around and asked in a loud voice, “Who, who’s here!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pressed down and realized that the feeling on her hand didn’t seem right. She hurriedly retracted her hand and looked down to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze met directly with that pair of languid eyes. If it wasn’t Baili Yu, that seductive yao, who else could it be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately moved away, sliding to the ground before standing up as she stared bewilderedly at Baili Yu. He, why was he also sleeping there!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Xiao Xueyi preparing to kill in order to silence?” Baili Yu opened his drowsy eyes slightly as he rubbed his chest which hurt from being crushed by Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this familiar voice, Tang Doudou slightly returned to her senses and stammered, “La-last night, w-we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she even finished asking, Baili Yu chuckled and said, “Xiao Xueyi’s passion last night was like fire…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop, stop!” Tang Doudou hurriedly rushed over to cover his mouth as she eyed the surroundings anxiously. “You, don’t make up things! I-I’m a man! How could, how could I have, with you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more she spoke, the less confident her voice became. At the very end, her voice just became as quiet as a fly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge! There’s no need to bring up the fact that she wasn’t a real man. Even if it was a real man, to do that, that kind of thing unsuitable for children. It’s not like there were no ways to achieve it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So in the end, did Baili Yu use her like a woman or a man?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When her thoughts reached this point, Tang Doudou couldn’t help but reach for the back of her butt, her little face turning deathly pale. Why did it feel like that area hurt a little? Could it be… that image was too beautiful, she didn’t dare to continue imagining it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Baili Yu didn’t completely open his eyes, he saw Tang Doudou’s little movements clearly. What did she mean? Or did she think he had that sort of interest?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When his thoughts got to that point, Baili Yu’s expression darkened. However, he lifted his lips to an incomparably brilliant smile and propped himself half up. The front of his garment opened unrestrainedly and his ink-like long hair spilled deep into the abyss that caused people to have countless wild fantasies. His lips parted and he said, “Xiao Xueyi’s flavor is really not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said so, he even extended his pink tongue and licked his lips, his long and narrow peach blossom eyes filled with an ambiguous expression.</span></p>
