 <p><b>Chapter 293.1: Searching</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Tang Doudou could figure out what Baili Yiling meant, Baili Yiling had flung the black balls overhead, then ran to her while shouting, "Run!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after she spoke, there was a rumbling sound as the ceiling exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after, the entire stone room started vibrating violently as the loud rumbling continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's facial color changed drastically. "Those things you threw earlier..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They were explosives! Sister-in-Law, hurry! Once the cave collapses, we'll be trapped!" said Baili Yiling hastily as she pulled Tang Doudou forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's a good thing that demonic bug isn't here this time, otherwise the thunderbombs definitely would have attracted its attention and it would be difficult to leave." Baili Yiling remarked in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knitted her brows. Something felt off. "From what you're saying, it's unusual for that demonic bug not to be here?" </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn't it? That bug was raised for the sake of guarding Lan Jia's secret rooms. In the past, even when Lan Jia was in trouble, he still had this bug stay here to guard this room!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then where did it go?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How would I know? Does it matter? It's good that it's not here since we need to hurry and escape. Once that cave collapses, these secret passages would slowly collapse as well. If it weren't for the fact that I only have twenty thunderbombs, I would have leveled this entire mountain!" As expected of Baili Yu's younger sister, no ordinary person would declare something as outrageous as blowing up an entire mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Tang Doudou still felt that something was off. "Yiling, say, do you think that demonic bug might've gone out with Lan Jia earlier?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words seem to have finally got through to Baili Yiling. Baili Yiling slapped her forehead and her expression immediately turned worried. "Oh no, how could I have missed that? Sister-in-Law, we can't delay any longer! We need to find Big Brother now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw that Baili Yiling looked worried, she nodded and took off her red robe to use it to tie the wooden box to her back. "Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this time that she was speaking with Baili Yiling, the explosion in the secret room seemed to have caused chain reactions along all the hidden passages in Cerulean Mountain. As the rumbling noise continued around them, their surroundings started to shake. It sounded as if the mountain was going to explode from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Crap, I've underestimated the power of the thunderbombs. I'm afraid these twenty balls are really going to make this mountain explode!" Baili Yiling's face turned pale as she increased her speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou followed her closely. Luckily, Baili Yiling was very familiar with the secret passages so they were able to get out quickly. However, the direction through which they had exited wasn't the same as the direction in which they had come in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We have no choice but to exit from this direction and walk back. If we went by our original path, we'd probably end up getting buried inside!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, it's good that we're out. Let's hurry and find your brother!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes! We need to find him first!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two spoke, they started rushing forward again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a short while, the Saint Palace came into sight. It was still ablaze with flames. However, since it was still a distance away, they couldn't see if Baili Yu was there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling said, "Let's hurry! Hopefully nothing has happened!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were black-robed people running all around them. Some even had flames licking at their bodies as they screamed like they were in hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou asked, "Why are these people still running around here instead of fleeing?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Without any Saint Envoys, they can't find the way out!" explained Bail Yiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they can't flee, then wouldn't they all burn to death?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling seemed to know what she was thinking as she said with a cold laugh, "Sister-in-Law, you shouldn't pity these people. If it weren't for their help, how would Lan Jia have been able to commit so many crimes?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although these people seemed pitiful, Baili Yiling was right...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go!" Tang Doudou no longer looked at those black-robed people. It wasn't that she was cold and heartless but that these people deserved to die, and she had no way of helping them either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yiling saw that Tang Doudou didn't waste time trying to pursue this topic, satisfaction appeared in her eyes. It seemed like this sister-in-law of hers wasn't the type of woman to dawdle. She was finding her more pleasing to the eye as time passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They passed through the hell-like scene of fire and arrived at the Saint Palace that they had left earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where is he? Big Brother!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was already no one in sight. However, there were many holes on the ground and the palace looked half destroyed. It was clear that an intense battle had taken place earlier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh no, where are we supposed to find them now?" Baili Yiling looked around anxiously with unease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was also very worried, but if both of them panicked and lost their wits, they'd lose all chances of finding Baili Yu. She forced herself to calm down and looked towards the ground for clues. Then she saw that there were marks made by something large and long that probably wasn't human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu had definitely been fighting the demonic bug that Lan Jia called Xiao Xi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yiling, I have a way to find Baili Yu!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Look at the marks on the ground first."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling had been completely flustered so she only noticed the abnormality on the ground when Tang Doudou pointed it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ha, Sister-in-Law, you're so smart!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You just lost your head from worry, otherwise you would have noticed too. Let's go and ask someone if they've seen them!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou adjusted her grip on the cloth bundle and started to walk towards the black-robed people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling hastily stopped her. She had just praised this sister-in-law for being smart, but this sister-in-law was acting dumb again. "Sister-in-Law, everyone's too busy running for their lives, who would pay attention to you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou slapped her forehead in realization. "Then what should we do?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, of course I have a way!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling looked up towards the sky, then put two fingers in her mouth and gave two long sharp whistles before ending with a short whistle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, two eagles flew over and circled them a few times before flying down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of the eagles had white heads and abnormally sharp eyes. It was clear that they weren't ordinary eagles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Xiao Qing, Xiao Yu, did you guys see that large bug?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Screech, screech</span></i><span style>!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two eagles flew into the air towards the southwest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law, let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou made a sound in reply, then hastily leapt forward with Baili Yiling to follow the two eagles.</span></p>
