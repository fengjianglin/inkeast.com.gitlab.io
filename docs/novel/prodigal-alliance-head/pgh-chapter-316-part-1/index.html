 <p><b>Chapter 316.1: The Feeling of Love</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, most of the boys have grown up in Wind Cherishing House, but there are some that only came here later." Jin Yi gracefully chewed as he blushed even harder. His eyes contained emotions as he stared at Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the time, when men said they were only here to chat, he wouldn't believe a single word of it, but when this sir said it, for some reason he felt like it was true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, what normal man would ask about this topic?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sir probably wasn't here to seek pleasure but to seek trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> had already told him how to answer if the guest asked this kind of question, otherwise he really would've fallen into this sir's trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Jin Yi's blushing face and the emotions whirling in his eyes, Tang Doudou couldn't tell if he was telling the truth and could only drop the topic. She waved her hand and had him leave to tell Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> to hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Yi obediantly walked outside. The moment he got to the door, his expression changed. He was just about to report to Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> when he saw Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> head over with the rest of the boys. When he saw that </span><i><span style>that person</span></i><span style> wasn't among them, he loosened a breath in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> saw that he was standing at the door, he frowned. "Jin Yi, why aren't you attending to the guest?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> has misunderstood, it was the sir that had me come out to take a look," replied Jin Yi as he bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> nodded and said to the boys behind him, "Be careful in your manners when heading in. This sir is a big client, so don't offend him!"</span><span style>"Understood!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, head in."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou heard the uniform cry of 'understood' very clearly. She put down her chopsticks and watched as the good-looking men walked delicately into the room in single file.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, they filled up this not-very-wide room. There were about thirty or so people and they were all either in white, light green, or blue. Some of them had their hair tied up, some of them wore it loose. In brief, there were styles to suit every taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced over them one by one. However, after looking at too many good-looking people, it tired out the eyes. As she looked over them, she started feeling like they all looked the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She frowned when she discovered that Baili Yu wasn't among them. She glanced over at Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> that was standing at the side. "That's all of them?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she asked this question, Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> became puzzled. Although it wasn't every single boy in this place, this was all of the boys who had above average to beautiful looks. There was no reason that this uncouth fellow wouldn't take a liking to any of them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>'s gaze sharpened slightly. "Our shop is small, so this is all the boys we have. Could it be that there's not a single one to Sir's liking?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knew that he was getting suspicious, so she unhurriedly made a lustful expression. "It's not that there's none to my liking, but it just feels like they're all pretty much the same. It's getting old... I came all the way here from so far away because I was seeking something special. Could it be that you don't have anything more special here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Special?" Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Like someone different from the masses!" Tang Doudou shot a 'you know' look at Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> before picking up the chopsticks and slowly starting to eat as she waited for his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>had no idea what he meant by special. He recalled the expressions this guest had since he came into this place. He realized that although she showed desire towards the boys, her eyes didn't contain any interest, thus he came to a bold conclusion, could it be that this crude guy liked ugly ones?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glanced doubtfully at Tang Doudou. When he saw that the guest was enjoying his food, he tried asking, "By special, do you mean someone a little uglier?"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou slapped the chopsticks on the table and shouted, "What are you saying!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> trembled. He had actually felt intimidated by this sound. He glanced at the guest in astonishment, then hastily lowered his head again. This guest was clearly just a vulgar and uncouth guy, so why was he able to emit an imposing aura that was even stronger than that of Master's?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn't have much time to think about this because Tang Doudou exploded again. "Are you going to do your job or now!? Trust me when I say I can just burn this damned crappy place of yours down! You don't even have anyone special? How could you start run a business that way? In that case, you might as well close now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>'s face turned pale, then ashen. It seemed this guy really was here to find trouble rather than entertainment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it wasn't a good customer, then there was no need to be polite!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>'s thoughts reached this point, he was just about to say something harsh to the guest when he saw Tang Doudou abruptly stand up with a stunned expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pointed and said, "I want him!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that he had guessed wrong? This guest really was here for pleasure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> was extremely confused, so he looked in the direction the guest was pointing to try and see which boy it was that got this honor. He had to make sure to warn the boy to be careful when serving this guest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he looked over, the boys moved out of the way to reveal a boy dressed in white that was standing there uneasily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So it was Xiao Liu ah!" When Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> saw that boy, he loosened a breath in relief. Xiao Liu did count as pretty special since he had a red mole in the shape of a tear drop at the corner of one eye that made him look sweet and delicate. Just as he was about to say something else, Tang Doudou had already got up impatiently to walk over</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> thought that he was still angry about the earlier matter and was about to take it out on Xiao Liu, so he hastily followed after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Tang Doudou reached Xiao Liu, she pushed him aside. "It's not you, what are you blocking the way for?"</span></p>
