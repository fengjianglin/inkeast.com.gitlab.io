 <p><b>Chapter 79: Celebrating A Little Too Early</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meow ah! Lou Qingyun sure was like a cockroach. She had thought he was dead several times already, yet he survived!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was rather happy to hear Lou Qingyun’s voice. The two were pretty much comrades that had gone through life or death trials and tribulations together. When she found out he wasn’t dead, she was delighted and hastily ran towards the voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>I thought you had already died. Your vitality sure is strong!” Tang Doudou exclaimed as she ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words probably injured Lou Qingyun a little because he replied gloomily, “No better, no worse <span style="color: #3366ff">(than you)</span>...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was heavily injured and so his words were completely weak. Tang Doudou laughed at him. “Who’s no better, no worse with you? I’m not injured at all. From the sound of your voice, even if you’re not dead, aren’t you pretty close?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun choked from her words and didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn’t waste time and reached Lou Qingyun in a few steps. As she took in his miserable appearance, she felt complete pity for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His clothes had been worn out to shreds and exposed the bruised skin under. There were even little Black Demonic Nightcrawlers hanging off some areas. Upon seeing this, Tang Doudou picked up some of the rice straw that was burning to the side and moved it towards those Black Demonic Nightcrawlers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun immediately opened his eyes and glowered at her. “What are you planning to do!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>If you don’t get rid of these Black Demonic Nightcrawlers, you’ll die!” Tang Doudou lifted the burning rice straw in her hand and moved it towards the Black Demonic Nightcrawler. She saw the bug withdraw backwards and exclaimed happily, “I think these little things are afraid of fire. Endure the pain a little, I’ll get them out. Rest for a while, then we can leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>You’re going to save me?” Lou Qingyun looked at her, astonished. It was to the point that he didn’t even notice when Tang Doudou pressed the fire against his skin. “Even if you get rid of the Black Demonic Nightcrawlers, I still can’t move. If you leave me, you’ll definitely be able to get out. But if you bring me along, that won’t be certain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Haa, even you’re saying that it’s not certain. Don’t worry, I won’t leave you behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou started thinking, but her hands continued to move. In reality, she wasn’t that good-hearted. When she heard Lou Qingyun say that he couldn’t move, she also hesitated a little. However, on second thought, if she really watched with her own eyes as another living person died, especially if it was because she didn’t extend a hand to help, she probably wouldn’t be able to sleep soundly for the rest of her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Qingyun heard what she said, he was so moved he couldn’t even speak. Just as he was about to say some words of gratitude, he heard Tang Doudou continue. “Of course, the remuneration can’t be left out. An ordinary antique lamp already costs five thousand taels, so a person as big as you should probably be worth several ten thousand taels right? However, looking upon the fact that we’ve gone through trials and tribulations together, I’ll give you an appropriate discount when the time comes…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Several ten thousands? Why don’t you just rob me!?” Lou Qingyun was left speechless. He had actually thought her kindness had flared up. Turns out it was for the sake of money!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>The risk in robbing is too great, it’s not a suitable choice for people as civilized as me. Saving people is still better. Not only can you earn money, you can also boost your reputation.” As Tang Doudou chattered, she switched through several stalks of rice straws. Finally, she managed to get all the bugs off Lou Qingyun’s body. After stamping them to death, she lifted her head and asked Lou Qingyun, “What do you think about this deal? Isn’t it worthwhile? A couple ten thousand taels to trade for one human life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>You, this, you’re taking advantage of the fire to loot a burning house!” Lou Qingyun exclaimed weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>That’s right ah, I am taking advantage of the fire to loot a burning house. Who asked God to have me take a wifey but not even possess the money to arrange the wedding matters? Aiy…” Tang Doudou sighed. “Alright, I’ve gotten all the bugs off for you. As for that deal, it just depends on you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Lou Qingyun notice that all the bugs on his arm had been gotten rid of. Quite a few black coal marks were left on his arm and there was even the scent of roasted meat. When he smelled that, Lou Qingyun became completely speechless. Did she directly roast the bugs along with his flesh!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, he had long been hurt so bad that his senses had gone completely numb. Otherwise, he definitely would have fainted from the pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>You’re really going to marry Baili Yu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t she acting pretty unwilling earlier on the streets?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Since he’s sent himself to my door, isn’t it a waste to turn him out? Not to mention, since he’s becoming my bride, he has to give me a dowry, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Ahem, you sure are direct.” Lou Qingyun was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rolled her eyes. Direct? As if! She just has no other alternatives ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Making it so that everyone thought she was doing it for the sake of Baili Yu’s money was also a good choice. It was perfect for covering up the fact that she had been poisoned by the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Lou Qingyun, yes or no? Give some response ah!” Upon seeing that Lou Qingyun wasn’t responding, Tang Doudou started urging him. The surrounding fire was growing bigger and bigger. Earlier the ground was too damp and so the fire wasn’t as strong, but after burning for a while, the heat had dried out a lot of the rice straw. If this continued on, this place was going to turn into a sea of flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun gritted his teeth and said with a rather helpless tone, “Then I’ll have to trouble Alliance Head Li to bring me out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is having a clear view of things! Tang Doudou smiled. In reality, even if he didn’t agree to it, she still would have brought him out. However, wouldn’t it be stupid not to seize a benefit when it’s laid out for you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lou Qingyun’s words were a little off ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou laughed ‘hehe’, then elbowed Lou Qingyun a little. “Then, how are we supposed to get up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun blinked several times as he looked at her. When he saw that there wasn’t the slightest trace of insincerity in those sparkling eyes, he was completely speechless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Hehe, doesn’t this require big Young Master Lou’s resourcefulness? You’ll come up with the idea and I’ll come up with the strength. Isn’t that a great combination?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>How much money is Alliance Head Li prepared to pay for my idea?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Aiyah, don’t worry, don’t worry. Once we get out, this Alliance Head will definitely calculate it fairly. Lou </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>will definitely be treated fairly! Right now, you had better think of an idea quick. Any longer and we’ll become roasted meat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What else could Lou Qingyun say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was still Lou Qingyun’s brain that worked better. He talked and explained a bunch of stuff regarding mechanisms, then instructed Tang Doudou to carry him and head towards the pile of broken iron chains next to the large hole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first step was to carry a big man so Tang Doudou thought it would take a lot of energy. However, after she lifted him up on her back, she realized that it wasn’t that hard. Looks like this was a benefit of Li Xueyi’s valiant constitution along with the concentrated amount of inner strength. In a short while, she made it from one end of the palace to the other end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place was precisely the place Xin Yue used to be in. Due to the fact that her entire body had exploded from the force of one palm strike from Tang Doudou, all her iron chains had shattered into debris as well. Because of this, the area Tang Doudou was currently walking on was filled with blood-and-flesh-covered iron chain pieces. The wretched sight was so terrible the two didn’t dare to lower their heads to look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun recalled the back figure he saw before he fainted and looked pensively at the back of Tang Doudou’s head for a long while, his eyes filled with a mysterious deep light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>It’s here, right?” Tang Doudou looked around. “You said this place had a switch so why did you want us to go out from the ceiling earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>With Xin Yue here, even if I knew there was a switch, I couldn’t risk coming over. That’s why I could only think of some other idea…” Lou Qingyun explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded and said in approval, “You’re rather smart ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is something that anything human would be able to think of, alright?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun didn’t even know how many times he had been made speechless today. Not bothering to reply to her imbecile-like question, he patted Tang Doudou’s shoulder so that she would let him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked up and around, then asked him, “You sure you want to go down?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Lou Qingyun also looked at the floor, then decisively declined. “I’ll stay above.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that Tang Doudou’s figure was too delicate and small, both her waist and her shoulders seemed very frail. When she walked, she kept swaying and wobbling as if she was about to trip and fall so he kept worrying about crushing her. That was why Lou Qingyun wanted to get down and see if he could walk on his own. However, the ground was covered with blood ah, flesh ah, and even some Black Demonic Nightcrawlers that haven’t been burned to death yet. Thus he decided it would be better for him to behave and stay on her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Tang Doudou know that he had all those worries? As she felt the surrounding temperature rise, she hastily asked, “Where’s the switch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>On the pillar over there. Look and see if there’s any area that’s not like the rest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing this, Tang Doudou rushed over to the pillar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stone pillar was very large and its diameter was about the length of three people’s outstretched arms. Some strange decorative four-legged beasts were engraved on it, however, it had been too long so they were all faded. The entire pillar was so mottled and the designs so disconnected that it was impossible to make out with the naked eye what part was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>If you can’t see, try using your hand to feel around for it,” Lou Qingyun said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Then I’ll put you to the side first?” Although it didn’t take a lot of energy for her to carry him this way, Lou Qingyun’s body weight and height were still there. After walking for awhile, she felt a little tired. While she could still carry him with both hands, she felt that she probably wouldn’t be able to with one hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun thought she was tired so he quickly replied, “Alright, you can put me down. Just don’t put me on those bugs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou lowered her head and looked for a place that was a little cleaner. Then she wanted to put Lou Qingyun down, but no matter what she did, she couldn’t crouch down. After struggling for a while, she just dropped Lou Qingyun onto the ground as if he were a sack. The second person didn’t manage to react in time and fell so hard he grimaced. “Are you trying to make me fall to my death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Ahem, sorry, my mistake, my mistake…” Tang Doudou patted her aching arms. Without paying attention to Lou Qingyun, she headed to feel that pillar. She felt around the entire pillar in order, yet she couldn’t feel anything out of the ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned back to ask Lou Qingyun. “That’s not right ah, how come there isn’t a switch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Feel it more closely. The switch won’t be that conspicuous so if you don’t examine it closely, you won’t be able to find it.” Lou Qingyun had watched her feel around like a little lady and spoke with a dumbfounded tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou replied ‘oh’, then turned around to continue feeling the stone pillar. This time, she slowed down and even patted a lot of the dust left over from the engravings. Finally, at a part of the ground that was engraved with something that was either a crane or a heron, Tang Doudou found a moveable rock piece. Her filthy little face turned elated. “Lou Qingyun, I’ve found it! I’ve found it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Hahaha, we’re saved!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou turned around, rushed towards Lou Qingyun and gave him a huge bear hug. “Haha, we can finally leave this damned place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Qingyun turned rigid when she hugged him and a strange feeling came from his heart. However, before he had a chance to think deeply about it, Tang Doudou had released him and reached out to help him up. “Let’s go. I’ll help you over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Not yet, don’t be hasty.” Lou Qingyun slapped away her hand. “You should go test it out first to see if it’s the switch we need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>There’s probably quite a lot of switches in this huge palace. I’m worried that it’s not the one we’re looking for. If that’s the case, when the time comes it’ll be troublesome.” Seeing that Tang Doudou seemed confused, Lou Qingyun said this in explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Wha, doesn’t that mean that if this isn’t the exit switch, we still have to keep looking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Pretty much. There’s no time to lose, Alliance Head Li should hurry to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell, she celebrated a little too early. Tang Doudou was annoyed as she walked towards that pillar again. “Will this switch be dangerous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, her hand paused on that stone piece. However, she didn’t hear Lou Qingyun’s reply so she turned back curiously. Unexpectedly, Lou Qingyun had stood up at some unknown time. He was supporting himself with one hand on the wall and smiling sinisterly.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">[Chiyomira's Corner]</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">Lou Qingyun can pretty much equal speechless. Like all he can do is be speechless. Or maybe it’s Tang Doudou that inspires nothing but speechlessness in people lol.</span></p>
 <p>And hmm, what was that other word for idiots Bobby from Supernatural always used? Igits, right?</p>
