 <p><b>Chapter 296.1: Huai City, Plum Garden</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling was confused. What did this sister-in-law want to do now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou walked over and tugged on her hand. "Yiling, let's just walk along the sea, alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few moments, Baili Yiling finally understood what Tang Doudou wanted to do. "You think Big Brother might've been washed ashore by the waves?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Before, when Mu Ye and I fell into the sea from the cliff, we encountered that sea dragon as well. However, it didn't seem to have any interest towards prey that didn't move and it also didn't like having the corpses in its territory. It's probably because it doesn't like the prey dirtying the water after it rots. If Baili Yu really was in this sea, the sea dragon definitely would've splashed him ashore. Although it might be hard to spot him, the demonic bug is large so we'd be able to spot the demonic bug from very far away. If we walk alongside the water, we'll be able to see if Baili Yu had fallen into the sea."</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yiling wasn't as certain. "What if Big Brother encountered the sea dragon before he had fallen unconscious? He was injured, so..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't bring herself to finish the sentence. "Sister-in-Law, let's listen to Senior Su and find a place to hide first. We can come up with a plan to look for Big Brother once Senior Su gets here."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yiling, you have to believe me. My idea will definitely work!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law, it's not that I don't believe you, but I can't have Senior Su's efforts go to waste. Moreover, I believe that Heaven helps the worthy, and who is more worthy than Big Brother? He's not destined for a brief life. If he had been, he wouldn't have been able to marry a girl as good as you, Sister-in-Law..." Although Baili Yiling said this, inwardly, she was thinking that if Big Brother had passed away, she had to take good care of Sister-in-Law in her brother's place. She heard that they had already consummated the marriage, so perhaps Sister-in-Law was already pregnant with her nephew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at the vast sea one more time, then said with a sigh, "Fine, let's find a place to wait first..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they ended up waiting for three entire days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were worried about encountering black-robed people and having their identities discovered, they hid themselves in what was left of the collapsed secret passages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling had apparently left some sort of trail and she reassured Tang Doudou that as long as Su Yi was fine, he'd be able to find where they were without problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days later, a person in ragged clothing found them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I've killed Shen Moru." This was the first sentence he said. After that, he said, "I used Shen Moru's blood to aggravate Lan Jia's demonic nature. He doesn't even know who he is anymore and kills everything in sight. I'm not a match for him. We can't stay in Cerulean Mountain any longer, we need to leave!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had been waiting in the secret passages for three days and hadn't eaten anything in this time. When Su Yi brought such sudden news, Tang Doudou and Baili Yiling were too stunned to react for a few moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru was dead? He died just like that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia had gone crazy? How?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aiyah, my dear girls, please stop dawdling! It took me three entire days to shake Lan Jia off. As of now, he's gone off following a fake trail that I left, so we only have a little time. We need to take advantage of this time and leave. Otherwise, if he finds us, our next stop will be the Yellow Springs!" As Su Yi spoke, blood started spilling out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's heart clutched in worry and she asked, "Master, are you alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, I won't die. If it weren't for the fact that..." He paused to wipe away the blood. "If it was a couple dozen years ago, even if ten berserk poison people came, they still wouldn't be a match for me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Poison people?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn't Lan Jia precisely a poison man now? That idiot really thought that thing was an immortality pill, but what immortality pill could be made with so many poisons? He's truly stupid beyond belief. For the sake of that extremely poisonous pill, he had killed so many of his wives and children. He deserved his fate of becoming a poison man!" Su Yi spat, then said, "LIttle girl from the Baili family, you're familiar with these paths, aren't you? Do you know where this place is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he pulled out a rag and passed it to Bail Yiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Su Yi had saved them, Baili Yiling was happy to help him and told him that she could find this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi immediately said, "Since you know how to get there, hurry and bring me there. Once I get the thing from that place, we'll immediately get out of here and never come back. I'm afraid it won't be long before this place becomes a living hell. The next place that'll run out of luck is probably Wind Cloud Island. If you, the martial arts Alliance Head doesn't hurry and head back, there will probably be an uproar on the Jianghu..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, how was she supposed to leave before finding Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two women shouted almost at the same time, "No!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can't leave before finding my older brother. If we leave, I don't know when we'd be able to come back again." Baili Yiling still had some little secrets, but she had no plans to tell these two about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi glanced at her without saying anything. Then he shifted his gaze to Tang Doudou and asked, "What about you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Me?" Tang Doudou pointed at herself. "Of course I share Yiling's views! We haven't even found Baili Yu's corpse, I can't leave just like this! He's mine!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Enough, that little fox wouldn't die that easily!" Su Yi felt seriously tormented by his disciple. All she cared about was that fox.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Old brat, do you know something?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Tch</span></i><span style>, what could I know? All I know is that good people have short lives and scourges live past a thousand!" Su Yi yawned, then said, "Alright, let's stop wasting time. Little Baili, bring me to that place, then we'll leave!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wanted to argue but Baili Yiling interrupted her. "Alright, let's plan to leave Cerulean Mountain first!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The minority had no choice but to submit to the majority. Since Su Yi and Baili Yiling had joined the same side, Tang Doudou had no choice but to go with their plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Baili Yiling was very familiar with the secret passages, they were able quickly to find what Su Yi was looking for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, they rode on horses and headed towards the east. With Baili Yiling, this human map guiding them, they soon reached the beach where they had entered Cerulean Mountain. There was a single, small boat that was swaying in the waves by the shore.</span></p>
