 <p><b>Chapter 352.2: Infiltrate Into the Enemies' Base</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of the people sat back down and just looked at each other silently. The prime minister stroke his beard for a few moments, then took the initiative to speak, "The Sangfroid Prince's move this time completely messed up our earlier plan."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What exactly is he intending? Prime Minister </span><i><span style>daren</span></i><span style>, do you know anything?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prime minister's expression turned solemn. He picked up the tea and took a sip before saying, "You all are aware of our Sangfroid Prince's relationship with Li Xueyi?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the officials shook their heads. They spend everyday busy dealing with the matters of the imperial court so they had no idea what went on the Jianghu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou who was lying on the roof also shook her head with them. What relationship did she have with Xiqiu Yue?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Prime Minister </span><i><span style>daren</span></i><span style>, how could there be any relationship between them?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prime minister smiled mysteriously. "The relationship's not simple either. Our Sangfroid Prince, towards that Li Xueyi…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn't finish his sentence, but the meaning was already very clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had black lines running across her face. Wasn't this prime minister's imagination way too reactive? It couldn't be that he was still thinking about what happened last time at the Prime Minister Residence's cooking competition?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Prime Minister </span><i><span style>daren</span></i><span style>, is, is that really true?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If it's true, then that's… Why did His Majesty hand this matter to the Sangfroid Prince…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prime minister shook his head. "How could we possibly be able to guess at His Majesty's intentions?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There didn't seem to be any more useful news, so Tang Doudou put the roof tile back and lay down to think. Based on what they said, they seemed to be thinking of ways to deal with the martial arts alliance, however Xiqiu Yue wanted to target her directly… So in the end, were they targeting her or the martial arts alliance?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, the most troublesome thing in Huai City was when you were being hunted by the imperial court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, in this place that was below the foot of the "Son of Heaven," even if the influential powers of the martial arts community wanted to make a move, they'd have to do it in secret. This gave Tang Doudou chances to take advantage of. However, the imperial court was different. They've listed so many crimes, so if she really appeared in Huai City, they could catch her openly and no one would dare to stop them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was the martial arts Alliance Head, in the eyes of the imperial court, she was just another common citizen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a ninth rank sesame official had a higher rank than her. In the past, the only reason Xiqiu Lin hadn't dared to do anything to her was because of Baili Yu. As of now, since Baili Yu had met with a mishap, she didn't have anyone to rely on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, this incident had gone on for quite a while, but Su Yi hadn't expressed his stance at all nor sent anyone here to help. The only possibilities were that something had also happened at Cloud City, or that Su Yi had abandoned her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for why, she wished that she knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She only got off the roof to head back to the guards' room when it was near daybreak. The men were deep asleep and snoring thunder. Even when she made a sound upon entering, no one stirred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced at the only open space left but wasn't able to convince herself to lie down, so she decided to just nap on the desk for a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she woke up again, quite a few people had already gotten up. When they saw that she was awake, someone came up to ask, "Liu Da, why were you sleeping here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. Didn't you go to the latrine yesterday? Why were you gone so long?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aiy, what's that on your face? Did you fall into the latrine? Hahaha!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pinched her throat and glared at them as she shouted, "You're the one that'd be freakin' dumb enough to fall into the latrine!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then what's with you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's expression turned serious and she beckoned for them to lean closer. When they saw her mysterious expression, they all drew closer. "Liu Da, you…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Last night ah…” Tang Doudou lowered her voice to create a very strange atmosphere. After pausing for a moment, she abruptly raised her voice. "I encountered a ghost!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah!" Everyone was given a scare by her sudden shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Liu Da, what kind of joke are you pulling? H-how could ghosts exist!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right, exactly! Stop making up nonsense! Let's go, if we don't assemble now, we'll be punished by the supervisor again!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>They spoke as if they didn't believe, but their expressions and flustered words made it clear that they were scared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Believe me, I experienced it personally! I was so scared that I screamed for help like my life depended on it. See, my voice is completely hoarse now." Tang Doudou reached out to pull those people so that they would stay and listen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, who would be willing to listen to such an unlucky story? Everyone ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Could it be that none of you heard anything last night? Hey, you guys didn't hear?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, I didn't! I didn't!" The person she caught hastily shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou acted as if she came to a realization. "No wonder no one came to save me even though I was shouting so loudly. It's probably because I was within the ghost's spell so you guys couldn't hear me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"L-liu Da, stop making things up, otherwise we'll tell the supervisor that, that you're disrupting our concentration!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fine fine, I won't say anymore." Tang Doudou snickered, then changed the topic. "I slept outside for an entire night so I'm really dizzy. Could you guys help me ask for a day off?"</span></p>
