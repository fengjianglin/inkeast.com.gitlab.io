 <p><b>Chapter 290.1: Baili Yiling</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia became stirred up the moment Shuyin said those words. He made to grab her hand but, upon recalling how she had reacted awkwardly stopped himself halfway. It was obvious that he was really anxious from the way his hands fidgeted with his clothes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Shuyin! We’ve dreamed of this for ages! I’m so happy that it’s finally coming true!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone could tell that he was bursting with happiness, but Shuyin's expression remained lukewarm. “You're wrong. </span><i><span style>You</span></i><span style> have dreamed of this for ages, not </span><i><span style>we</span></i><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not do this now, Shuyin. Weren’t we once lovers? Why do you insist on being like this now that we’ve finally met again?” sighed Lan Jia. He seemed to feel melancholic about the past events. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin scoffed. “Back in the day, you had tens if not hundreds of lovers. When they encountered you again, they must have wanted to eat you alive, drink your blood, and swallow your bones… I believe that my current attitude towards you is already one of the best, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words seemed to have caused Lan Jia to recall some unhappy memory because his excited expression instantly vanished. He humphed coldly and flung his sleeve back to turn to face the large cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this exchange between the two foxes, although it appeared as if Shuyin had seized the advantage and was trampling all over Lan Jia, the fact was that she feared Lan Jia and had no choice but to use words instead of force. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt awful for them even as an uninvolved onlooker. What kind of person was Lan Jia exactly to have had so many lovers in the past? It was no wonder Baili Shuyin had chosen to return to the palace to be with Xiqiu Qing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She had heard about Xiqiu Qing from Baili Yu. Although he was a very ambitious person, he was also very devoted and had only taken one wife his entire lifetime. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to this playboy Lan Jia, he was way better. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was no wonder that Nangong Yan’s personality was so extreme as well, it must have been due to Lan Jia! Tang Doudou couldn't help but wonder which woman Lan Jia had her with, and how she had ended up becoming the Eldest Miss of Wind Cloud Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did Lan Jia even know that she was his daughter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Doudou was wondering about these things, something started happening to the big cauldron. Sounds of wind, water, and crashing waves were coming from the cauldron as if there was a whole other world contained within it. Could there really be an miracle pill in there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This process didn't seem much different from the process of pill-making that was described in novels, so she couldn't help but start thinking along those lines. However, when she looked over at Shuyin, she saw that Shuyin still looked unperturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Lan Jia was so excited he practically wanted to jump into the cauldron to take a closer look. The noise went on for quite awhile before tapering off to nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin remained expressionless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lan Jia exploded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shuyin! What is going on? Where is the pill?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he climbing onto the cauldron. Right after taking a look, he whipped around with his eyes bloodshot and screamed, &nbsp;“Where did the elixir go!?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was scared to the point she was trembling and hid behind Shuyin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin was smiling lightly. “I’ve told you, everything is fake.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fake? No!” Lan Jia turned and crawled into the cauldron. “It can’t be a fake. There’s definitely an immortality pill. There has to be!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he disappeared into the cauldron, Shuyin grabbed Tang Doudou and said quietly, “Let's go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded hastily and ran out of the room with her. When they got out, the tiger called Xiao Xi immediately got up and pounced over, but Shuyin lifted her hand and sent a white sash flying towards it, causing it to smash into a wall. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, Shuyin once again began running while pulling Tang Doudou along. However, they had only taken a few steps when Shen Moru appeared with Mu Ye in tow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru prepared to leave upon noticing the duo, but Shuyin said, “Shen Moru, didn’t you want the immortality pill? It's already done. Lan Jia is currently going crazy with happiness inside. If you don't go now, once he consumes it, you’ll never get another chance in this lifetime.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing the words ‘immortality pill’, Shen Moru’s eyes lit up with the fervent flames. He had been chasing this immortality pill long before Lan Jia began. He had schemed, plotted, and groveled under Lan Jia for so long… it was all for this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately threw Mu Ye down and turned into a black fog to rush towards the stone room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin glanced at Mu Ye before pulling Tang Doudou off. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo... Mother, please wait…” How could Tang Doudou leave Mu Ye behind now that she’d seen him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuyin took a closer look at Mu Ye and her smile became a bit cold, “So he's Mu Ye?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, yes.” Tang Doudou felt chills upon recalling Shuyin’s interested tone from earlier. “H-he's saved my life several times. I can’t just leave him to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at Shuyin nervously, worried that she would be angry and kill Mu Ye with a single smack. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To her surprise, Shuyin just laughed lightly. “Alright.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, as Tang Doudou watched in surprise, she undid Mu Ye’s acupuncture seal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After the seal was undone, Mu Ye's cold gaze swept over Shuyin before landing on Tang Doudou. “Mother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, Baili Yu’s mother…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting your breath! Once Lan Jia comes back to his senses, none of us will be able to leave!” Shuyin reminded them impatiently as she started running with Tang Doudou again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye blinked in confusion before following suit. </span></p>
