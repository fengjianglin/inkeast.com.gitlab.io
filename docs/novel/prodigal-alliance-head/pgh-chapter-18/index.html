 <p><b>Chapter 18: The Feeling of Acting Cool</b></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humph, they all think that she can't be the Alliance Head, don't they?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she's definitely taking that position!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire hall, from the moment Tang Doudou stood up and walked to the stage, was entirely silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how Li Xueyi's character was, his strength was truly unquestionable. Even though there were few that have actually seen him in action before, but some people were simply like this. Even without acting, just based on their impressive fame they would be able to intimidate the people.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inwardly, even though there were people that felt like Li Xueyi's abilities were all just rumors, but when they saw the actual person, one by one they shut their mouths and didn't dare to speak even a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention, just then Li Xueyi was amongst them and heard them trash-talk him quite a bit. As long as he didn't hold a grudge it was already amituofo*, who would still dare to stick out their bird head here and try to stop him from ascending the stage.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">amituofo is a common prayer chant in Buddhism, in this context it's kinda like "praise the Lord" or "thank God"/"God save me".</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Just like this, the high-spirited Tang Doudou stood on the stage and looked down in all directions. A feeling of heroism came forth from her heart, holy crap this must be the so-called the higher you stand the farther you can see. The scenery from a high place sure is exceptional.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Look at that good-looking young girl who has her chest wrapped. Tsk, tsk, looking down like this sure is out of the common run ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then look at Bai Feiyun, Elder Yu and the others. Humph, small fries. No matter how amazing you guys are, you still must stay under this big sis's pomegranate-dyed skirt!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unwilling to accept, huh?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unwilling to accept then come up and bite her ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was incomparably exhilarated inside. No wonder everyone likes to act cool, this feeling is practically like flying up to heaven!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at Tang Doudou who was on the stage, after the silence passed, everyone in the hall simultaneous ended up exploding into loud laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some even laughed to the point they fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laughing to the point that Tang Doudou was completely confused. From the corners of her eyes she suddenly saw that there were some unknown objects on the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing it clearly, thunder immediately roared from the skies. Seriously it's like walking into a pole in daylight ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>What possessed her to walk up here!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could only be seen that below her feet was a mess. The brightly colored gaudy things were all women's garments, faint waves of young women's perfumes wafted over. Then connect that to the location they were in right now, Tang Doudou's eggshell* was almost about to shatter.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Egg is another way to refer to your face because one aspect that was traditionally viewed as beautiful was if people had egg-shaped faces. As for the stage, strip show?</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Li </span><i><span style>gongzi </span></i><span style>deserves to be so renowned. Today, I've truly seen. Sure enough, he really isn't of common chord." From the crowd of laughter came Elder Yu's especially obvious mocking words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking down, she saw that a hint of a smile even hung around his mouth. Seeing this, the shattered eggshell Tang Doudou promptly calmed down again: "This Alliance Head is naturally not of the common chord. Otherwise why would I be Alliance Head, while you, Elder Yu, is just an Elder?"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The scenery from high heights, I'm afraid Elder Yu will never be able to understand in this lifetime!"</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You!" Elder Yu was shocked by Tang Doudou's words to the point he choked. He had never seen such a shameless person before, for a short while he actually couldn't find any words with which to retort.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yiyun at some unknown time had ended up standing next to Elder Yu. The two pressed their heads close and muttered for a while, then all that could be seen was that Elder Yu waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>And then someone stepped out from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing on the stage, Tang Doudou could see very clearly and she curled her lips in disdain. Just then Bai Feiyun had said that Elder Yu had gotten someone from Cloud Sun City to expose her wrongdoings in order to make it so she can't successfully become the Alliance Head. Looks like he's planning to use this strategy right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recalling Bai Feiyun, her watery pupils flitted across him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw in his knitted brows and gaze the question, why did you talk so much and provoke Elder Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She just gave a cold humph and turned her face away.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>You damned silent thing. You already threw me out, and you still want me to see, hear and obey you? Which show's international joke are you pulling?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>She, Tang Doudou, sure doesn't have integrity and doesn't have face, but there's no way she doesn't have self-knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun obviously wanted to use her like a chess piece. Helping her was only so that he could reach his goal, he completely didn't care about her feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very start she was being led by the nose by Bai Feiyun, she almost really ended up completely trusting him. Fortunately, she acted right in the nick of time. Otherwise, if she waited for Bai Feiyun to become aware that something was fishy with her, he'd definitely get rid of her immediately without the slightest bit of mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps he was already suspicious of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
