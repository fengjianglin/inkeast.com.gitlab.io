 <p><b>Chapter 311.1: Setting Off</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw such a strange scene, she stopped covering her nose and covered her mouth in shock instead. She stared at the Swayflower in astonishment, before glancing at Mu Ye and gulping. "Wh-what exactly is that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A Swayflower," repeated Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But, why would my mother leave me something so strange?" Tang Doudou retreated backwards and looked at Mu Ye in alarm. Could it be that the current Mu Ye was a fake?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye saw her suspicions, but he didn't expose them and just looked straight at her as he slowly said, "Your Disseminating Tassel Fragrance isn't completely under control."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. Cang Baicao had said that it was cured, so why was Mu Ye saying that it wasn't under control?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Before, I didn't know why Senior Jun left you the Swayflower either, but after this last trip to Cerulean Mountain, I finally found out what it could be used for." Mu Ye picked up the bloodless snake skin and threw it into the chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was still skeptical. "But you're poisoned with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance too!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, it's fine." Mu Ye didn't seem to mind at all and continued putting that flower back into the box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is this Swayflower very hard to get?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is the only one in the world."</span><span style>It was actually that rare? It was no wonder that Jun Yuner would leave this for Li Xueyi. Tang Doudou sighed, then asked, "Was this flower something my mother planted?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was something Senior Jun created." Whenever Jun Yuner was brought up, Mu Ye's eyes would be filled with admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was also quite astonished. That 'mother' of hers really was impressive, to have been able to create a species of flowers. It was probably done through grafting?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The name Swayflower was worth considering. Then there were the special characteristics of this flower. It looked like a carnivorous species. To cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene of how that snake's blood had been sucked dry was still vivid in her mind. Suddenly, a light bulb lit up and Tang Doudou widened her eyes as she exclaimed, "She wants to use this flower to suck away the poison blood in my body!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye was stunned for a moment. How had she guessed it so quickly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's definitely it! Right?" After coming to this conclusion, she started rubbing her chin and mulling over the rest. She could understand the idea, but it probably wouldn't be easy to implement. The first problem was how to control this flower. If they didn't control it while it sucked out the poison, she might end up just like the snake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just the thought of it made goosebumps pop up all over her body. There was no way she would use it without guarantees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, she recalled the box she had brought out of Cerulean Mountain. Baili Yiling had said that the box contained the antidote to the Hoarfrost Poison, but what it contained wasn't a strange flower like this. The only reason she had been able to guess what this flower was used for was because she recalled the possible methods to cure the Hoarfrost Poison that she had discussed with Grandpa Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she couldn't figure out which method was actually reliable, she could tell that their deceased seniors really had put a lot of effort into making cures for the poisons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only one who was deranged and heartless was Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As of now, since Shen Moru was dead and Lan Jia had gone crazy, there was probably no one that would come for their blood again. Thus, it was a good time to figure out how exactly to cure their poisons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, she had really celebrated for nothing. She had been thinking this whole time that her Disseminating Tassel Fragrance had already been cured!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En." Mu Ye put away the box and handed her a bamboo flute. "I'll leave the flower here for the time being. When you're ready, look for me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou accepted the flute, then asked, "You know how to cure it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I saw the method to cure the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance etched into Senior Li's bones."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Etched? Could it be that someone actually cut his bones after he died? That's..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was while he was alive. While he was alive, he used inner strength to force a needle into his body to etch these instructions. Thus, after he died and his bones were revealed, the instructions would also become clear. Senior Jun and Senior Li truly were amazing people."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou fully agreed with his remark. Fudge, to etch the instructions to cure a poison onto your bones while you were still alive must have caused unbearable pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And there was the fact that they had been able to plan so far ahead. He had definitely expected a descendent to find him, and had made certain that it would be a friendly one before allowing himself to die in that hole. He had definitely waited for many years for Mu Ye to finally find him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had he really not been worried that someone else might've found him first?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Doudou silently expressed her doubt, on the surface, she nodded with Mu Ye in admiration. "They're truly amazing."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you plan to do next?" asked Mu Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou tucked the bamboo flute into her waist as she replied, "Of course I'm going to go look for Baili Yu!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was her main task. She had to find her man first before she'd have the mood to think about other things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye didn't seem surprised by this answer. As he stood up, he said, "I'll see you off the mountain first. Flowing Clouds Palace has been very restless lately, and you killed so many of their members yesterday so there's no way Fu Yunliu would just sit back and accept this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's fine, Jun Xin's with me!" Tang Doudou stood up and patted the dust off her skirt. "Since you're injured, you should rest. This isn't far from the foot of the mountain, and you were the one that taught me qinggong after all. I'll definitely be able to get there quickly without a trace."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'll go with you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye went with her until they were near Jun Xin and only left once he saw with his own eyes that she had met up with Jun Xin.</span></p>
