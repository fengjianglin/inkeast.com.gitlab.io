 <p><b>Chapter 129.1: Taboo</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Doudou strolled on the streets, she kept feeling the presence of someone following her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wouldn’t do. Even though she knew that it was someone Baili Yu had sent to protect her, she couldn’t let Baili Yu know about what she was going to do next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t told Baili Yu about the mysterious person that delivered the child lamp to her either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that she was intentionally keeping it from him, but simply that she felt she couldn’t tell Baili Yu about it, otherwise, it’d cause him a lot of trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was also very puzzled by another thing. So many people seemed to know about the antique lamp, why was Baili Yu the only one who didn’t know about it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had never seen him look at the antique lamp with any particular interest either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But back to the current matter, how should she shake off that annoying tail behind her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Tang Doudou spotted a brothel out of the corner of her eye and immediately broke into a devilish smile. Hehe, you’ll do! It’s a strategy that has yet to fail ah! She didn’t know how Baili Yu trained his subordinates but they all seemed very averse to the pleasure quarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For Tang Doudou, however, the pleasure quarters were a great place ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced casually behind her, then strode right in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression of the hidden guard that was following her immediately turned unpleasant when he saw her enter the brothel. How was he supposed to continue following like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>His family’s master never went to dirty places like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the sake of his mission, however, he gritted his teeth and went around to the back of the building so he could climb onto the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Tang Doudou became familiar with manipulating her inner strength and using qinggong, her seeing and hearing abilities had become much keener. As of now, despite the clamor of the brothel, she could still hear the sounds of someone treading on the roof tiles of the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything was within her predictions. Tang Doudou snuck a glance at the ceiling and saw that a roof tile had been removed. There was a faint bit of light peeking through. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255)">In the past, or in Chinese wuxia dramas, the roof tiles that make up the roof are easily removable and spies would often remove a tile to peek in on the occupants of the room.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255)"> E/N - If this was real, they'd flood inside the houses every time a rain storm hit. At least I hope they aren't THAT stupid. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255)">T/N - Extra trivia: back when doors and windows were covered with paper instead of glass, spies would lick their finger to moisten it and poke a tiny hole through the paper to spy…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>She used the same old method and called a bunch of women into the room. Taking advantage of the time while they were noisily mingling, Tang Doudou slipped out of the bustling crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the person on the roof could see were the tops of many heads of black hair. He couldn’t see the faces so he could only differentiate Tang Doudou from the others by her clothes. He was completely unaware that Tang Doudou had already switched outfits with another person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he realized that something was off and rushed into the room through a window, Tang Doudou was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Tang Doudou had already changed into a male outfit and was making her way, according to what she remembered and little inquires, to Gu Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right, she had wanted visit Gu Xun’s place!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you looking for?” After Tang Doudou knocked, a manservant poked his head out from the door and questioned her in an annoyed tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m looking for Gu Xun, is he in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looking for </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>?” The manservant sized her up. Upon seeing that her aura didn’t seem like that of an ordinary person, he opened the door and stepped out. “Who are you? What are you looking for </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll have to trouble Little Brother to tell your family’s </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> that Li Xueyi is looking for him. He’ll understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Xueyi?” The manservant looked as if he was trying hard to recall something. Suddenly, he said in realization, “So it’s Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> ah! Come in, come in! My family’s </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> has said that as long as Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, you, came to look for him, he’s always in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...what an honest manservant. Did Gu Xun know about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manservant seemed a bit embarrassed about his earlier rudeness. As he led Tang Doudou in, he was extremely attentive. He answered everything Tang Doudou asked extremely thoroughly to the best of his ability, allowing Tang Doudou to successfully fish out of him a lot of information about Gu Xun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She finally found out why this guy was working with Old Suo to conduct that sort of immoral and shady business. It turned out to be completely because of Gu Xun’s father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was also Bai Feiyun’s father. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In any case, their father was an unbelievable scumbag who angered Gu Xun’s mother to death, then took Gu Xun away and sold him to a human trafficker. A person from the Bai family had stopped Gu Xun’s father in time to rescue Bai Feiyun, but after that, there was no news at all about the Gu family’s father and son pair. After Gu Xun was sold to a human trafficker, he used his quick wits to rapidly improve his position within the trafficking center. In the end, the human traffickers couldn’t bear to sell him off and kept him to train as a successor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those human traffickers were eventually successful in raising Gu Xun to be an elite human trafficker. Once Gu Xun grew to adulthood, however, he broke faith and kill those human traffickers, then established his own specialized group of human traffickers. His group focused on selling people that had quite a bit of status; ordinary citizens didn’t garner their attention at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was during an operation that he encountered Old Suo. For some unknown reason, the two hit off and soon came to Mist City to set up camp here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After many years of operation, Gu Xun became greatly influential in Mist City. On the surface he ran restaurants and conducted some trades but in reality, the number of people that had been sold by him was so high that it could no longer be counted. Despite that, no one has ever dared to investigate him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because he had the Lord of Mist City as support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who asked Gu Xun’s human trafficking business to be one of the pillars of Mist City’s economy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were all things that Tang Doudou managed piece together by indirectly questioning the manservant.</span></p>
