 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 377.2: Four Large Families </strong></u></span></p>
 <p><span style>"Everyone, I still have some things I need to grab…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li, go ahead. There's no rush, we'll wait for you to get ready so we can head over together." Bai Luoqing got up with a smile. Someone handed her a very beautiful fan made from purple feathers and she lifted it above her head to block the sun as she looked at Tang Doudou with an expression that seemed to say 'don't try any tricks.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou silently remarked that this woman was seriously scary, but on the surface, she replied with a straightforward smile, "En, then I'll have to trouble everyone to wait for a moment."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, she turned and knocked on the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she walked in, she was about to close the door when she noticed Bai Feiyun out of the corner of her eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have something to say to you." His low voice was barely audible. Tang Doudou looked towards Bai Feiyun in confusion and saw that he had already walked past her into the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yi and Xiao Ren hadn't heard about Bai Feiyun's change and greeted him cordially when he entered. "Bai <em>gongzi</em>, long time no see! You haven't visited the valley recently, we thought that you wouldn't be coming anymore."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right! Bai <em>gongzi</em>, what have you been busy with lately? In the past, no matter how busy you were, you would still come visit once a month. Now that you don't come at all, it feels strange."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was surprised. Bai Feiyun actually used to visit Azure Water Valley that frequently?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun replied mildly. "It's been rather busy lately so I haven't had a chance."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aiy. Say, why did so many things suddenly happen on the Jianghu in just two years?" Xiao Ren sighed and looked towards Bai Feiyun with pity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yi expressed his agreement. "If you didn't have so many mundane matters to deal with, based on your natural talent, had you focused on studying medicine, you'd definitely be able to surpass Valley Master really soon!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Right!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Medicinal expertise doesn't always require studying to improve." Bai Feiyun's tone was still very indifferent. He glanced towards the inner courtyard. "I'm going to the library to look for something, so I'll have to trouble you two to keep an eye on me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Before Valley Master left, he said that from now on, Bai <em>gongzi</em> is welcomed to use the library as you please. If you want to take something, feel free to! We don't have to keep an eye on you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao left the valley as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder she hadn't seen him for such a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Cang isn't in the valley?" asked Bai Feiyun in faint surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yi nodded. "He left several days ago. He seemed to have expected you to come, because he told us this right before he left."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thanks." Bai Feiyun didn't continue asking questions and headed straight to the library.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had also visited that library several times when she first got here. All that was in there were medicinal books. She couldn't understand it, so she didn't go in there anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Bai Feiyun's figure disappeared at a corner, Tang Doudou called down Jun Xin who was still crouched on the roof. "How long are you going to stay up there? Are you waiting for candy to fall from the sky?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin stretched laxily, then got up and jumped down gracefully. "I thought you forgot about me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou made to rap his head, but before her hand landed, her wrist was caught and pulled. She lost her balance and fell into Jun Xin's arms.</span></p>
