 <p><b>Chapter 138.1: I’ll Definitely Be Back</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi was surprised to hear what Tang Doudou said. “Old Cang isn’t the type to make this kind of mistake. Let me have a look at that booklet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let him look at it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her nose and gave a very unnatural smile. “I didn’t bring that booklet. How about I show it to you some other time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi didn’t like wasting time. He waved at Tang Doudou and said, “If you want to be able to help Baili Yu cure his poison sooner, then hurry and let me have a look at it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still had to bring her back to Cloud City after helping her with this trifling matter. Amnesia is nothing but trouble. In the past she could head back and head out whenever she felt like it without any regard for his city rules - which led to no small amount of complaints from those old men in Cloud City - but, now she probably wouldn’t even be able to find the way back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou heard this, she couldn’t be bothered to worry about whether it was a ‘little yellow rabbit’ anymore. She stood up and said, “Then wait for me. I left that thing in the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce. I’ll go grab it and come right back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi pulled her to a stop and said, “Don’t you think that’s troublesome? Why don’t I just go with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Wu agreed, “That’s right. You’re a girl, it’s best not to randomly run around at night. Just let Su Yi take you back, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn’t find any reason to refuse this offer so after saying goodbye to Feng Wu, she prepared to head back with Su Yi. Unexpectedly, the moment they stepped out of the City Lord Residence, their path was blocked by Murong Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Xueyi, come with me.” Murong Ming obviously did not recognize Su Yi since he had rushed up and rudely shouted at Tang Doudou the instant they stepped out of the City Lord Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge? Does this guy have a mental illness?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was rendered speechless as she looked at Murong Ming. Back then Feng Wu was just saying that in order to give him a way out of the embarrassing situation, yet he actually took her words seriously!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, he had been waiting for her for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If his tone had been a little more courteous, perhaps she would have found time to chat with him a little about that pitiful lil sis’s <span style="color: #3366ff">(‘mei4zi’ this is a general very informal way to refer to a girl)</span> situation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi reacted before she could even speak. Setting aside Li Xueyi’s status in Cloud City for now, just based on the fact that she was the current martial arts Alliance Head made her status high enough that no ordinary person should dare to casually call her by name!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, scram right now before this </span><i><span style>da ye</span></i><span style> gets angry!” He had been excited to go back to Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce with Tang Doudou. Of course, it wasn’t for the reason that Feng Wu said, that he was worried about Tang Doudou heading out alone at night. After all, children that walked the Jianghu were different from something like an unmarried daughter of a noble house!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was actually looking forward to meeting with Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was heading over with the resolution to con Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming’s blocking of Tang Doudou’s path was pretty much the same as blocking his path. This crime cannot be forgiven!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was this person? How dare he talk to him this way? <span style="color: #3366ff">(This is Murong Ming’s thoughts now)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi’s features were fresh and elegant and his attire was usually in accordance with his temperament. However, today, for the sake of being a Spring Festival couplet with Feng Wu, he had put on a crimson robe. Rather than giving him an enchanting and flirtatious air, the attire seemed out of place and made him appear like a little<span style="color: #3366ff"> (male)</span> courtesan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming thought about Baili Yu and Li Xueyi’s unclear relationship, then looked more closely at Su Yi. Could this person be Li Xueyi’s new darling?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once this thought emerged, the more Murong Ming looked at Su Yi, the more he felt certain of this possibility. Hence his eyes became filled with disdain as he said, “Who do you think you are, to dare speak this way to </span><i><span style>ben gongzi</span></i><span style>!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bro ah, you sure are capable ah, to dare speak like this to the Lord of Cloud City!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the sake of avoiding the ensuing violent scene, Tang Doudou silently said ‘pray for yourself’ to Murong Ming and ran to hide behind a nearby stone lion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming knitted his brows upon seeing that. What was that about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before he could think much more about it, a painful feeling transmitted from his chin. Following that was a bone-shattering sound. Tang Doudou heard this and hastily covered her chin. This was way too cruel!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to act fierce towards </span><i><span style>lao zi</span></i><span style>!?” Su Yi didn’t stop cursing even while beating the guy up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One punch after another greeted Murong Ming’s face. “People who are fierce towards </span><i><span style>lao zi</span></i><span style>, if they aren’t already dead, they are not much different from dead! Who the f*ck do you think you are!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-you! You actually dared to hit me!” Murong Ming was dumbfounded. He never thought that Su Yi would suddenly turn violent and so it was only after being punched a few times that he managed to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am hitting you, this grandson, what about it!?” <span style="color: #3366ff">(Calling someone ‘grandson’ is a way of looking down on them)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“And you even dare to curse at me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am cursing at you, you damned grandson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh. If you had the ability to, you could do this to me as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sounds of punches mixed with Murong Ming’s angry pitiful cries as well as Su Yi’s unbridled cold laughter. Tang Doudou couldn’t bear to look directly at the scene. This Murong Ming actually seems pretty good at enduring. He didn’t retaliate even after being beaten up this bad!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Tang Doudou possibly have known that Murong Ming also wanted to retaliate but for some reason couldn’t? His pressure points hadn’t been hit, yet his body wouldn’t obey him. All he could do was watch dumbly as he got beaten up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart gradually chilled. It was likely that he had run into an expert this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never thought that there would be such a high-leveled expert by Li Xueyi’s side. The only reason he had dared to be so rampant in picking fault with Li Xueyi was because he had heard rumors that Li Xueyi had lost his martial arts and was now powerless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never expected to end up meeting with such a mishap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never thought that this thin-skinned tender flesh could stand up to a beating this well!” Su Yi had hit him for half a day but when Murong Ming gradually stopped screaming, he became disinterested in it. What meaning was there in hitting someone that didn’t scream?<sup>T/N</sup> </span></p>
 <p><span style>So Su Yi just threw him on the ground. “</span><i><span style>Da ye</span></i><span style>’s in a good mood today so </span><i><span style>da ye</span></i><span style> will stop here. Stop hanging around here to hinder </span><i><span style>lao zi</span></i><span style>’s line of sight, hurry and scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming only recovered control of his body after Su Yi released him. He hastily climbed up from the ground. He reached out to touch his face which was numb from being hit, then he glared at Su Yi as he said menacingly, “Boy, you just wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiy, do you see this? He’s gotten addicted to being beaten up. Alright ah, remember that this </span><i><span style>da ye</span></i><span style>’s name is Su Yi. When you go looking for a beating you better not end up looking for the wrong person!” As Su Yi spoke, he took a step forward with a smile that didn’t quite seem like a smile, scaring Murong Ming into running away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even as he ran he didn’t forget to say fiercely, “Su Yi, you just wait! I’ll definitely be back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pfff. Wasn’t this Big Big Wolf’s signature line?<span style="color: #3366ff"> (from Chinese animated series: Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>This Murong Ming sure was a weirdo. Even though he clearly knew he wouldn’t be able to beat Su Yi, he still wanted to come back and be beaten up.</span></p>
