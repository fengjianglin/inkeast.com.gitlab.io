 <p><b>Chapter 313.1: Exceptionally Good Lady</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young men downstairs looked at each other, then the man at the very front cupped his fist and bowed to Tang Doudou. "This brother, I don't seem to have seen you around?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou could tell that they were interested in making friends, so she replied straightforwardly, "This one is Tang Longbiao. I only arrived in Hibiscus Garrison yesterday, so it's not strange that you guys haven't seen me before."</span></p>
 <p><span style>That man replied with a smile, "So it's like that."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he said, "Brother Tang, this one is Lin Shuxuan. Seeing as Brother Tang also enjoys cultural pursuit like us, would you grant us the honor of having a drink together?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, I was just worrying about what to do today. Since Lin </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> has extended such a cordial invitation, then this Tang will gratefully accept!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Brother Tang's personality and words are both straightforward, you are truly a refreshing person. It seems that it was a good choice to head out today! It is our fortune to have been able to meet Brother Tang, don't you guys agree?" Lin Shuxuan laughed, then flipped open his fan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other young men nodded in agreement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pressed one hand on the windowsill and jumped out gracefully. Lin Shuxuan's group exclaimed praise at this sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan's eyes lit up. "So Brother Tang was actually a martial arts expert!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou cupped her fist with a smile. "Brother Lin is joking. I only learned a little bit from my master, how could I count as a martial arts expert?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aiy, Brother Tang, it has actually been my dream since childhood to learn martial arts, but sadly... Haa..." Lin Shuxuan sighed and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the other young men said, "Aiyah, Young Master Lin, you have so many people protecting you whenever you head out, so why put yourself through the torture of learning things like that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tsk, what do you know?" Lin Shuxuan shot a disdainful look at that person before saying with a laugh, "Brother Tang, come this way. An encounter is fate, so let us drink until we are drunk!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two were just about to walk forward when someone said, "Young Master Lin, we, we..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Say it already!" Lin Shuxuan was annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, could it be that Young Master Lin has already forgotten about Lady Hibiscus?" That person laughed vulgarly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan shot him a look and frowned. "Speak more decently. Don't make a fool of yourself in front of Brother Tang!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person hastily said with an apologetic smile, "Yes, yes. Young Master Lin's chastising is correct."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan nodded with satisfaction and snapped his fan closed as he asked Tang Doudou, "Brother Tang, so you came to Hibiscus Garrison this time..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou laughed heartily and shot a wink towards the group. "Of course it was for... Hehe..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan, who had just scolded the other guy for not acting decent, immediately nodded understandingly with a vulgar smile. He tapped his fan on Tang Doudou's chest. "I never would have thought, so Brother Tang was also a kindred spirit ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haa, sweet, fair, and graceful beauties, noblemen truly... wishes to collect ah!"<span style="color: #3366ff;"> (The correct ending of this phrase is noblemen truly desire.)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Another burst of vulgar laughter rang out on the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting to the matchmaking event area with these people, Tang Doudou looked around and found that it was truly a sea of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn't expected for a matchmaking even in a small town like this to be so popular.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah Cai, where's the private room? Where's the private room I had you prepare ahead of time? It couldn't be that you want this young master to sit with this crowd of country bumpkins?" Lin Shuxuan, that picky rich kid, looked around and immediately became displeased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah Cai hastily replied, "Young Master, don't get angry, the private room is right over there. Ah Cai will lead you there right away."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Quit dawdling, otherwise this young master will fire you!" Lin Shuxuan shook his fan. When his gaze shifted over to Tang Doudou, he smiled warmly again. "Brother Tang, this way please."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded and started walking forward with vigorous steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan's eyes whirled, then he glanced meaningfully at the men following him. One immediately said, "Young Master Lin, this Tang Longbiao doesn't seem like a normal person. There's no nearby large family that has the surname Tang either, so could it be that he came from the Imperial City?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Send someone to his inn to ask around about him. All of you, be careful and don't mess up in front of him. If he really is here for Hibiscus, that's fine, but if he isn't..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou, who was walking in front, smiled slightly when she heard what they said. It seemed like this small Hibiscus Garrison actually contained a lot of secrets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The so-called private room was just a stage that had about two dozen chairs separated by tables.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, isn't this Nephew Lin? You had the time to visit Hibiscus Garrison today?" The moment Lin Shuxuan's group walked over, a fat man that looked around fifty walked over to greet them. This stage wasn't for just anyone to sit on, so this man's status in Hibiscus Garrison probably wasn't low. However, despite his seniority, he was facing Lin Shuxuan with an ingratiating smile, so it caused Tang Doudou to become curious about Lin Shuxuan's identity.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">C: Lol, the name Tang Doudou came up with sure is valiant. Tang is her usual surname, but long = dragon and biao = tiger stripes.</span></p>
