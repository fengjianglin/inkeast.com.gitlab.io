 <p><b>Chapter 356.1: Baili Yu's Family</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Baili Yiling and Tang Doudou were chatting, something shot towards them with shocking speed. The glints of silver rapidly enlarged. Just as those weapons were about to hit them, they suddenly fell backwards and the weapons ended up brushing past them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thud!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sounds of impact rung out clearly from above their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily looked over and saw that two hidden weapons had stabbed deep into the stone above them. All that was left revealed was a bit of silver. Tang Doudou broke out in cold sweat. If they had been hit, they would've died for sure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that someone had pulled them, otherwise they would already be wandering ghosts right about now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law, what are you dazing out for?" Baili Yiling spoke in an low, urgent tone, pulling Tang Doudou back to her senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We don't know how many people there are. From the looks of it, they're probably still very far away, so we should hurry and leave!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded in agreement, then climbed onto the horse. Baili Yiling jumped onto the horse as well and squeezed with her legs, prompting Little Bell to dash forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh no! They're leaving!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hurry and catch them!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, the voices behind them were submerged by the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law, are you alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm fine. What about you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm fine too. However, it looks like we've been going too slowly since they actually managed to catch up. Urgh!" Baili Yiling then looked around worriedly. "We have to be much more careful about the rest of the journey."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who saved us earlier?" If it weren't for the fact that someone had pulled them when the hidden weapons were flying over, they would've been done for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling rolled her eyes. "The guy that's been following you the whole time, obviously!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the two didn't take any breaks or chat much. The atmosphere was very tense. It was only when the sky started to lighten again that Baili Yiling finally pulled on the reins. "We're here."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We're here?" Tang Doudou looked at the gray cliff in front of them. "You're talking about this place?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's get off first!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's this on the ground?" The moment Tang Doudou jumped down, she felt that something was off. Just as she was about to look down, Baili Yiling grabbed her and said, "There's nothing. Let's hurry and go inside before the people following us catches up!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling had Little Bell leave, then started leading the way down the cliff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cliff was very steep and the bottom of it couldn't be seen. In addition, since it rained a few days ago, even after a couple sunny days, the rocks and soil were still very moist and slippery. However, Baili Yiling was walking comfortably like it was just normal flat ground. It was clear that she came here often.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time they reached the bottom of the cliff, Tang Doudou's clothing and legs were covered with mud. When she turned around to look, she was shocked. She hadn't noticed while they were walking that the cliff had actually been that high!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law, follow closely, alright? If you end up getting seperated from me, I won't be able to find you in this place!" Baili Yiling saw that she was spacing out while looking up and went over to grab her arm. "Let's go, let's go. Stop looking now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou withdrew her gaze and knitted her brows slightly. "This is a sinkhole?"</span><span style>"That's right, what about it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's nothing." Sinkholes tended to have a lot of radioactive material. If someone stayed here long term, there'd be serious health complications. She originally wanted to ask Baili Yiling if she came here often and also wanted to ask if people lived here, but it occurred to her that she would be able to find out soon anyways. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking for a short time, they reached a row of wooden houses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling then asked, "Sister-in-Law, did Big Brother ever tell you about his tribesmen?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu's tribesmen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou thought back. When she recalled what Baili Yu had confessed to her that time, she nodded. "He's mentioned it before. Could it be that they live here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En. In the past, Big Brother would often come to visit them. However, since Big Brother disappeared for way too long this time, they contacted the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce out of worry. I just happened to be in the store that time, so I met them and ended up learning about this place. After that, I came here several times to assure them that Big Brother was fine. If they ask you later, don't tell them that Big Brother lost his memories. Just tell them that Big Brother is busy dealing with something, that's why he doesn't have time to come visit."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw that Baili Yiling looked very serious, she nodded and lifted her hand in a vowing manner. "I got it. Don't worry, I definitely won't let anything slip!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aah!" A tall man had at some time appeared in front of them. When they looked up, they almost crashed into that man. When Tang Doudou got a clear look at him, she immediately cried out in alarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Y-Y-Yiling! W-why's he here!?"</span></p>
