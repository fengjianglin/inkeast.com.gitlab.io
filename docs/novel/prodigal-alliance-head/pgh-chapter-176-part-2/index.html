 <p><b>Chapter 176.2: Jerry-Built Construction</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fruit entered her mouth. The taste was actually pretty good. It was sweet and tasty, and very juicy as well. She didn’t know what kind of fruit it was, she had never seen it before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that this color looked way too bright, like that of a poison fruit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment this thought occurred to her, she spat out the fruit. Her facial color was unpleasant. The hell? It really was poisonous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She opened her mouth, but her tongue was numb and she couldn’t even talk anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She instantly felt like crying but didn’t have the tears. Da fudge? What exactly was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn’t dare risk eating the colorful fruits again. But Mu Ye, seriously, shouldn’t he at least check to see if the fruits were poisonous before picking them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was hungry and also couldn’t sleep, she decided to just go out and walk around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The injuries on her foot still hurt a little, so she could only walk on tiptoe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Big Sister, why did you come out-yo? You’re still injured, you need to rest-yo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Tang Doudou left the room, Nan Maner appeared from somewhere and hastily stopped her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, the room’s too stifling. I wanted to come out and get a bit of fresh air.” After she found out that Nan Maner was one of Shen Moru’s subordinates, she couldn’t feel any intimacy towards her anymore. At the same time, she didn’t dislike her either. The numbness had faded from her tongue a little already. However, it still felt a bit numb when she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it was like that-yo!” Nan Maner nodded naively. She didn’t notice Tang Doudou’s strange manner of speaking. “Then just stay on the sacred tree-yo. No matter what, don’t get off the sacred tree-yo. The people below are very fierce-yo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sacred tree?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Tang Doudou realize that she was currently standing on a tree branch. It was just that this tree branch was enormous. Wooden boards formed a flat surface and the dense leaves around didn’t let in much light, so it had caused her to think that she was in some forest. She never expected that she was actually on a tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She instantly started feeling a bit weak in her legs and stomach. Who knew how safe this irregular construct was?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if it was a jerry-built construction? It wasn’t impossible that she would fall down in the middle of the night while she was sleeping!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heehee, Big Sister, are you worried that you’ll fall?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou’s freaked out manner made Nan Maner cover her mouth and giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O-of course not!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why are your legs trembling-yo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she swept her gaze over Tang Doudou’s trembling legs and smiled mischievously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was perspiring profusely inside. She pulled back her legs and said, “Ahem, it’s cause I’m hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I almost forgot-yo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she mentioned that she was hungry, Nan Maner promptly smacked her own cheeks, then looked at Tang Doudou apologetically. “Sorry-yo, I forgot to bring food for you-yo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all my fault-yo, I have such bad memory-yo. Grandma even reminded me before she left-yo, but I actually forgot-yo…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily interrupted her ‘yoyoyo’s. If she kept continuing it would go onto ‘check it out!’ <span style="color: #3366ff">(There’s a Chinese phrase used to get attention that sounds like the English words “Yo! Yo! Check it out!”)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then will you still be able to get food now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course-yo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” Could it be that she had to say it directly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Maner finally caught on. She moved her fingers and pouted at Tang Doudou. “Don’t worry-yo, Big Sister, I’ll definitely get food for you-yo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks!” It wasn’t that she was heartless or impatient, but that she really didn’t want to continue to listen to ‘yoyoyo, check it out’ words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, Nan Maner was very naive and didn’t notice the impatience in Tang Doudou’s tone at all. She smiled sweetly. “Big Sister doesn’t need to be polite-yo. Saint King said that I must do my best to fulfill everything that Big Sister needs-yo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Haha… (sarcastic laugh)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn’t continue this conversation with her. She tiptoed cautiously on the wooden plank ground. She only relaxed and started walking towards the edge after she confirmed that the planks were quite stable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Maner disappeared after she had finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knew that she had gone to prepare food for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t see Mu Ye. She didn’t know if he had ditched her and ran off or went to do something with Shen Moru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that she was narrow-mindedly thinking of random things but that Mu Ye had become strange after he saw Shen Moru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she wasn’t very familiar with Mu Ye, and was even almost ‘kacha’-ed by him when they first met, later, during the Plum Garden Gathering after he asked her to make a deal with him while she was in the latrine, their relationship seemed to have gradually improved. After that, he taught her qinggong in Azure Water Valley, then intercepted the God Firmament Hall’s attack and saved her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>All these events occurred quite close together. Now that Tang Doudou thought about it, it was quite clear. Mu Ye’s change had happened after the Plum Garden Gathering, meaning that it probably had something to do with the deal he had mentioned before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what exactly was that deal about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had met so many times afterward but why hadn’t he brought it up again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come out?” Just as Tang Doudou was deep in thought, Mu Ye’s voice came from above her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So there was a wooden ladder up. Looking at the ladder in front of her, she asked curiously, “What’s above?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tree.” Mu Ye poked his head out from the dense leaves. “I picked the fruits from here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would have been better if he hadn’t brought it up, but the moment he brought it up, Tang Doudou felt like cursing again. Fudge! When he was picking, he was definitely just picking whatever looked pretty. He probably never bothered to think about whether it was poisonous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they all plucked from this tree? But all those fruits look different. How could they all come from this one tree?” Tang Doudou pointed at the dense leaves above her. “And, don’t you sense a strange feeling from this tree?”</span></p>
