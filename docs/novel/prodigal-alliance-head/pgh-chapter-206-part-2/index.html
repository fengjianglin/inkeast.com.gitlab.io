 <p><b>Chapter 206.2: He Has Come</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really wanted to laugh but that feeling immediately disappeared, because Ming Mengxin had taken out a certain object.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's facial color immediately changed. Hadn't Baili Yu put that lamp in Plum Garden?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would it appear in Ming Mengxin's hands!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jesus ah, this was seriously too strange!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked towards Baili Yu and found that he had already leapt onto the stage and landed not far from Ming Mengxin. Meanwhile, Nangong Yan was angrily stomping in place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan whispered something to her but only met with a harsh berate. Following that, Nangong Yan turned and walked back to her seat to continue watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one could stop Baili Yu from doing what he wanted, not even Master. That's why she learned to be very obedient and only made some small moves behind his back. In front of Senior Brother, she always acted innocent and unaffected, and supported all his decisions unconditionally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, she could tell from the conversation earlier that Baili Yu thought he had simply fallen asleep and didn't suspect her of drugging him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked worriedly towards Baili Yu, then directed her wrathful gaze towards Tang Doudou. It was all this woman's fault. If something happened to Senior Brother, even if it was just that he lost half a strand of hair, she'd have this stinking woman buried!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She'd make her understand that people of Wind Cloud Island aren't people that a person with lowly bloodline like her could claim connections with!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was completely baffled by Nangong Yan's furious glare. She scratched her head, then decided to ignore her. Gripping the hems of her clothes nervously, she asked, "What if he can't beat him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yi replied with a smile, "I think you should be worrying about Ming Mengxin instead. That little fox's tolerance is practically nonexistent, who knows how badly he'll beat the kid... However, the question is, should I act to save him at that time? That kid's not bad."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw how excitedly he was staring at Ming Mengxin, she felt goosebumps rise all over. It couldn't be that this old brat had some sort of unique fetish?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere on this side was still pretty good, but the atmosphere on the stage wasn't good at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ming Mengxin pulled out that antique lamp, he simply looked at Baili Yu silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu was still smiling as he glanced at the lamp meaningfully. Then he looked at Ming Mengxin for a few moments, before saying, "Ah Xin, we meet again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah Xin?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her head, recalling faintly that he had also called Jun Xin this way. She subconsciously glanced below the stage but saw that Jun Xin had left at some unknown time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where did that guy go?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely saw something tasty and went to secretly eat! Disloyal guy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, she retrieved her gaze and looked towards the two on the stage with confusion. They knew each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn't link Jun Xin with Ming Mengxin because the two were truly too different. Anyone who didn't know the situation wouldn't have been able to link those two people together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the way Baili Yu called him 'Ah Xin,' both their names had 'Xin' in it so it wasn't surprising!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu's intimate tone was worthy of being mulled over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ming Mengxin didn't speak. No emotions could be made out from his cold eyes either. Just as everyone was completely confused as to how he would deal with Baili Yu, he suddenly reached up towards his mask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a collective inhale as everyone held their breaths and stretched their necks to see better. They were extremely curious about Ming Mengxin's appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some unknown reason, Tang Doudou also felt very nervous. She felt as if the face below the mask would cause her to be extremely stirred up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You said before that you would never call this name again." Ming Mengxin laughed lightly, his tone filled with taunting and contempt. "Baili Yu, I never expected that a day would come when you would actually beg me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he pulled off the mask. The silver butterfly mask cut a beautiful arc through the air and landed on the ground, rocking slightly.</span></p>
