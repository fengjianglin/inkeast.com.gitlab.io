 <p><b>Chapter 303.2: Find a Man for Sister-in-Law</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin sighed. "Why torment yourself this way? Do you think he'd be happy that you killed yourself to follow him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"At least I won't hurt anymore." Tang Doudou's tone was firm. She glanced at Jun Xin and said, "I want to rest."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou lay down with her back facing Jun Xin. However, her eyes remained wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin covered her with the blanket. "Sleep well. Since you don't want to see Bai Feiyun, I'll find you a different doctor."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you going through all that trouble? Jun Xin, I'm going to die sooner or later. You won't be able to keep an eye on me forever. Why not just let me die now so everyone can go on with their lives comfortably?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I've already said that you're not allowed to die."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou abruptly sat up. "I insist on dying!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin gave a cold humph. "It's not up to you to decide."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What right do you have to get involved in my decisions? Who do you think you are!?" When Jun Xin refused to budge, Tang Doudou abruptly started shouting and threw everything on the bed at him. "I'm not even Li Xueyi, nor am I Tang Doudou! I'm not the person you guys are looking for! I don't belong to this crappy place! Why won't you let me go back? Why won't you let me return!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>She just didn't want to suffer the pain anymore. She would rather stay unconscious forever than to face this painful reality!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was right! She liked running away! Because, what could she do besides run away?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Doudou!" When Jun Xin saw that her emotions were going out of control again, his anger was immediately replaced by worry and he rushed over to press down her hands in order to prevent her from hurting herself. "I don't care who you are as long as you're you!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slap</span></i><span style>! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou slapped his face hard. "Who do you think you are?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who I am isn't important. What's important is that, he's..." Jun Xin repressed the pain that was spreading through his entire body as he looked at her. "He's already dead! He's dead! Even if you die, you won't be able to see him again. Don't you understand?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you think that once you die, everything would end?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you think that once you die, you won't hurt anymore?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you think that once you die, I won't hurt anymore? Tang Doudou, please wake up! Death doesn't solve anything! Moreover, we still haven't found Baili Yu's corpse. What if he's not dead?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not dead?" Tang Doudou seemed to recovered some hope for a moment, but it was only for a brief moment. "If he's not dead, then why hasn't he come back?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tang Doudou, once a person dies, there's no more hope. Only the living has hope. You should know this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If he's alive, we must find him. If he's dead, we must see his corpse." Jun Xin reached out to pull this hateful woman into his arms as he said softly, "I'll go with you to search for him. Before we find what's left of his corpse, don't mention wanting to die again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if we do find it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"At that time, if you want to die, I won't stop you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pushed him away. Her eyes gradually filled with spirit again. "Alright!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I believe in him. I'm sure that he wouldn't die so easily." Jun Xin's hand paused in midair for a moment before he lowered it. "You have to believe as well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou lay back down on the bed as confusion flashed through her eyes. Should she believe?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, Lan Jia had spoken with such certainty...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That sea isn't connected to the larger ocean. As long as you agree not to attempt suicide again, I'll immediately send people to search that sea!" Jun Xin frowned. He got news from God Firmament Hall that Lan Jia had left Cerulean Mountain a month ago. As of now, Cerulean Mountain was a dragon without a head. The true Hall Master of God Firmament Hall, Jin Fengyi of the Gold Tribe, had already set off towards Cerulean Mountain to deal with the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His relationship with Jin Fengyi was not bad, so with him there, it probably wouldn't be difficult to search that sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's not connected? But I saw that sea dragon outside and I saw it again in that sea. If those bodies of water aren't connected, how did that sea dragon get in and out? It couldn't be that it can actually fly like the legends say?" Tang Doudou felt like Jun Xin was just lying to her in order to dissuade her from committing suicide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's no reason for me to lie to you and no matter what, I've already made you a promise. I'll bring you over so that you can see for yourself, alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if you don't find anything in the sea? What if the sea dragon already ate him?" Tang Doudou couldn't bring herself to say anymore. There were too many scenarios that could take place in the large sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't you know that the sea dragon doesn't eat dead things?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And even if it had eaten him, we can just kill it and cut open its stomach to see."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You can beat it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's already severely injured from fighting with Lan Jia. I heard Jin Fengyi say that when he went to take a look and tried provoking the sea dragon, it didn't even bother to surface." Jun Xin picked up the blanket, pillow, and clothes on the ground. "Alright, don't worry about that anymore and just rest. I'll make the preparations, then we can head off!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then what about Plum Garden? Yiling..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, Sister-in-Law, there's me here. I won't allow Big Brother's business to fall into someone else's hands!" Baili Yiling walked through the door. She had been listening outside this entire time and heard everything that Jun Xin had said. No matter how Jun Xin treated her, it had to be acknowledged that he treated this sister-in-law of hers really well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just getting Sister-in-Law out of her comatose state probably took a great deal of effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she didn't like the fact that a man other than her brother was being so nice to her sister-in-law, Jun Xin was currently the best choice of personnel to take care of her sister-in-law. If her older brother really had met an unfortunate mishap, it wouldn't be bad for Sister-in-Law to get together with Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In any case, she didn't like Mu Ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she was amused by her own heartless thoughts. She was already thinking of ways to find a man for her sister-in-law before her brother's corpse had even cooled. If her brother knew, wouldn't he crawl out from hell to throttle her?</span></p>
