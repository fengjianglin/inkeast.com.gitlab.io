 <p><b>Chapter 160.1: Urgent Situation</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xueyi?” For a moment, Yu Fenger couldn’t recalled who Bai Feiyun was talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao didn’t remember either. Even though they knew that Tang Doudou was Li Xueyi, they were used to calling her Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two looked at each other for a few moments without moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter who it is, since it was Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> who called us, let’s go take a look?” Yu Fenger had a vague, bad premonition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao was also planning to do the same and immediately nodded. “Alright, let’s go see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so, the two jumped over into the Alliance Head Residence. However, in midair they saw that Bai Feiyun was running out of the residence chasing after a figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly is going on?” Yu Fenger was completely confused but still pulled Jin Longbiao to head towards the Alliance Head Residence’s exit. Unexpectedly, after a few steps an uproar occured in the residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People poured out from all the corners of the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it that dares to trespass in the Alliance Head Residence!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that these guards suddenly appeared made Golden Wind Jade Dew feel very depressed. No one had ever blocked Bai Feiyun and Tang Doudou even though they were always running back and forth between the two courtyards!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did so many people appear the first time they jumped over?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since Doudou was the Alliance Head, Yu Fenger didn’t want to fight these people and explained patiently, “We’re friends with your Alliance Head. We live next door in Bai Courtyard. We only came here to help Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quit wasting words! All trespassers should die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, take these two down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Fenger still wanted to try and explain, but how could Jin Longbiao possibly endure these people’s chirping with his impatient personality? He swung his morning star and smashed back the first row of people, before pulling Yu Fenger and running. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The head guard that was blocking them hastily shouted, “Hurry, stop them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said that, many guards jumped onto the wall and started attacking Golden Wind Jade Dew. There were many people with bows among them. It caused the pair to become angry and start fighting with the guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re seriously a bunch of annoying guys. Jin </span><i><span style>ge</span></i><span style>, don’t bother with them anymore. We’ll lose sight of Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> if we don’t hurry!” Even after fighting for a while, the number of people didn’t seem to decrease at all. Yu Fenger felt that these people weren’t trying to kill them but simply trying to delay them and prevent them from helping Bai Feiyun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jin Longbiao had a straightforward personality, he was no musclehead. Moreover, he had pretty good tacit understanding with Yu Fenger so he immediately understood what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using his morningstar, he smashed a path through the guards, then spun his morningstar so that it made a whirlwind, keeping the guards from approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this moment, Elder Yu appeared amongst these guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Golden Wind Jade Dew, you’ve finally come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For half a month he had been waiting to find evidence of Tang Doudou’s wrongdoings, however he never found a good chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he knew that Golden Wind Jade Dew lived in the neighboring courtyard, he didn’t dare to make a move due to Tang Doudou being there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, the heavens actually gave him such a good opportunity today!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did something happen to Li Xueyi, making him act like a lunatic, but Bai Feiyun actually called Golden Wind Jade Dew to help and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wouldn’t it be a waste if he didn’t properly cherish this great opportunity?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He must stop Golden Wind Jade Dew and prevent them from saving Li Xueyi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fenger ah, Yu Qingshan, that old thing seems to be over there!” Jin Longbiao’s eyesight was pretty good. He noticed Elder Yu with one glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It does seem like him!” Yu Fenger deliberated for a bit. “Was he the one that told these guards to block us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh no!” Yu Fenger cried out as if he had suddenly thought of something. Sending out palm strikes one after another, he struck away all the guards that were blocking their way. “Jin </span><i><span style>ge</span></i><span style>, I remember now. Isn’t Xueyi our Doudou? That old thing is trying to delay us and keep us from saving Doudou!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao immediately understood, then his gaze turned fierce and he roared at Elder Yu, “Old thing, you’re seeking death!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before his voice even faded, his figure along with the violently revolving morning star headed towards Elder Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Yu wasn't a vegetarian either. Lifting both hands, he concentrated his inner strength into a white ball of light in front of his chest. He abruptly pushed it forward and it made contact with Jin Longbiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous shockwave sent many of the guards flying. Elder Yu was also forced back several steps. He was inwardly shocked. He’d never expected that this mountain bandit’s martial arts would actually be this good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao was also sent flying backwards, but Yu Fenger caught him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jin </span><i><span style>ge</span></i><span style>, let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin Longbiao estimated the gap between himself and Elder Yu and felt that there were pretty good chances at victory if they really started fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he thought about the fact that something might have happened to Tang Doudou, he dropped the idea of continuing the fight. After sharing a glance with Yu Fenger, their figures transformed into rays of light, before disappearing from the Alliance Head Residence in a blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their speed was so fast even Elder Yu was caught unprepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of martial arts was that? It actually made it possible to move as fast as lightning!” Greed filled Elder Yu’s eyes. Golden Wind Jade Dew, originally I was just planning to capture you two to use against Li Xueyi, but now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He swept his gloomy gaze over the guards. “Return!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood! Elder Yu!”</span></p>
