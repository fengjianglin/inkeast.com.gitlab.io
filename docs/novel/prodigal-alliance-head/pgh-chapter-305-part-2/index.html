 <p><b>Chapter 305.2: Kidnap Bai Feiyun</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun seemed to be heading somewhere secretly, as he kept walking through small, mostly empty alleys and glancing back to see if anyone was following him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it weren't for the fact that they were very skilled at qinggong and that Jun Xin was an expert at concealing himself, they would've already been discovered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was originally planning to kidnap Bai Feiyun as soon as they got to a quiet place, but when she saw that he was acting strangely, she decided to wait and see what he was up to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, are you going to do it or not?" Jun Xin pulled Tang Doudou and asked this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced over at Bai Feiyun, then whispered, "Isn't he acting strange? He's definitely off to do something shady. Since he's someone of the Alliance Head Residence, if he did something bad, other people would say that I, as the Alliance Head, failed in disciplining my subordinates."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're just curious, aren't you? Why make up so many excuses?" said Jun Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glared at him. "If you don't want to go, just head back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, I'm pretty curious as well. Bai Feiyun has always been called the 'white jade </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>' and is known on the Jianghu as a rarely seen good person..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, enough, I know what you mean." Tang Doudou hastily waved to stop Jun Xin's chatter and jumped forward just in time to see Bai Feiyun enter a small door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go, hurry!" Tang Doudou beckoned Jun Xin and jumped onto the roof. She saw that Bai Feiyun was following a peasant into a house in the small courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin followed her at a leisurely pace. He glanced over and remarked, "That pleasant seems to be from the Bai family."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You know him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Saw him once."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What a strong memory," said Tang Doudou half-teasingly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She was just about to jump down when Jun Xin stopped her. She turned and asked, "Why are you stopping me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you dumb?" Jun Xin glanced at the courtyard again. "The reason I remember him is because he's a trusted aid of the Bai Family Head."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou seemed confused. "So what?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So there's no need to look. Since that guy's here, Bai Feiyun is definitely here to see the head of the Bai Family," explained Jun Xin. Then he lay down on the roof and folded his arms behind his head. "For now, let's just wait for Bai Feiyun to come out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is the head of the Bai Family a really powerful person?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"On the Jianghu, the most famous powers aside from your Alliance Head Residence are the four large clans: Lin, Bai, Murong, and Xiao. After you lost your memories, you didn't have much interest in managing the matters of the Jianghu so you naturally don't know this. Although the Lin family was the leader of the four large clans, it's the Bai Family Head, Bai Luoqing, who's the strongest in martial arts."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A woman?" Tang Doudou was surprised. She hadn't expected that such a powerful person would actually be a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin just asked in response, "Aren't you also a woman?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn't Bai Feiyun cut his ties with the Bai family? Why would he secretly come here to meet Bai Luoqing? Could it be that everything he said before were lies?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They were definitely true, but the person that cut ties with the Bai family was his mother, not him. The Bai family is a strong reliable support since they have large human and material resources. It's not something that White Clouds Manor can hope to compare to."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, I get it now." Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. "He wants help from the Bai family for something?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin brushed back his loose hair. "En."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But what is it for?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's not good to be too curious."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tch, fine, I won't go, but in a little while, make sure to move fast and knock him unconscious for me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm only here for the show. When did I become your subordinate?" Jun Xin closed his eyes. "I'm not going."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You little brat!" Tang Doudou slapped his head. "I have a lot of inner strength but I barely know any martial arts. If I do it, I'll immediately be discovered."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, so what does it have to do with me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You! One meal! Are you going?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't think you can bait me with food..." Jun Xin flipped over and propped up his head. His eyes shone as he extended three fingers and waved them in front of Tang Doudou. "Add, add three more! Four meals!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fine, fine, fine!" Tang Doudou really didn't know what to do with this gutton. She slapped aside the claw in front of her. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw Bai Feiyun walk out. She hastily slapped the back of Jun Xin's head. "Stinkin' brat, hurry!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin slowly got up. "If you hit this little master again next time, I won't bother with you anymore."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Enough talking, hurry and go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun cupped his fist as he bid goodbye to Old Bai, then walked out with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Bai hesitated for a moment before saying, "Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, please don't blame this old man for speaking out of turn."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since you know that you're speaking out of turn, don't speak. Feiyun still has business and will be leaving now," replied Bai Feiyun mildly before leaving without turning back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun was concerned over something so he didn't notice Jun Xin swaggering behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou lay on her stomach on the roof. As she watched Jun Xin walk right behind Bai Feiyun without even bothering to hide, she felt so nervous that her heart tensed up. This guy was way too fearless. What if he got caught?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she watched Jun Xin worriedly, she quietly urged, "Little brat, hurry up ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin waved her off, annoyed. Then he picked up a rock and weighed it in his hand for a moment before exhaling and saying, "Bai </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's mouth twitched. Why happened to sneakily knocking him out!? This idiot!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun's brows furrowed slightly as he turned around. "Jun..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he even finished speaking, he was hit by the stone in Jun Xin's hand. A trace of confusion flashed through his eyes, then he collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
