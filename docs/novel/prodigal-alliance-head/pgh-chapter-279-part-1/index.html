 <p><b>Chapter 279.1: But Very Pitiful</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pah</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was the sound of another slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, there continued to be the sound of things being smashed until all the sounds eventually faded. There was probably nothing else left to smash. All that was left was the distinct sound of heavy panting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Liu Zhiyuan spoke those earlier words, he didn't make anymore sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nangong Yan started crying. "Why? Why are you treating me this way?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why? I also want to ask you why you treat me this way?" Liu Zhiyuan didn't soften when Nangong Yan cried; his tone remained cold and vicious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What did I do? You're the servant Father bought, a lowly and wretched existence. Putting it nicely, one would call you a servant, but one can also say you're just a dog! Could it be that I'd have to be polite to a dog?" Even at this point, Nangong Yan still refused to humble down her attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words successfully drove Liu Zhiyuan to explode. "Dog of a slave!? You're right! I'm just a dog!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words contained so much anger it sounded almost tangible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou shuddered as she silently remarked, oh no.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she expected, there was the sound of a thump as something heavy hit the ground. Following that was a low pained moan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck! The person has started 'driving' again by himself without a word. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was very conflicted. Although Liu Zhiyuan hadn't stated it clearly, nor had Nangong Yan admitted to it, the whole story was already very clear. Back then, Baili Yu hadn't drunk that soup and the only person that could have possibly delivered the soup was Nangong Yan's most trusted aid, Liu Zhiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Baili Yu hadn't drunk that soup, it was very likely that Liu Zhiyuan drank it. It was even more likely that Nangong Yan had ended up drinking it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of who it was that drank the soup, something had definitely happened between Liu Zhiyuan and Nangong Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later, Nangong Yan figured out what had happened, but she continued to deceive herself and refused to accept the fact that something had happened between her and Liu Zhiyuan. Following that, she continued being infatuated with Baili Yu while gradually hating Liu Zhiyuan more and more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason she was so nasty to the person always accompanying her was probably because she felt humiliated from the thought that Liu Zhiyuan had sullied her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to kill him, but couldn't find a good reason. Her greatest fear was probably that Liu Zhiyuan would reveal the incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, she started to feel that she was unworthy of Baili Yu. However, her desire to obtain Baili Yu only increased. After constantly suppressing these painful feelings for such a long time, it caused her mentality to twist. That was why she wanted to also sully the people by Baili Yu's side and cause them to feel the same pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After organizing this information and sorting out her thoughts...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt that she was completely innocent! Why did she end up getting hit by this even though she was lying so far away?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if Baili Yu disliked Nangong Yan so much, why did he walked out of this room with her so intimately that day?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that his personality had suddenly changed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn't very likely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was thinking through the possibilities, Mu Ye's voice suddenly appeared in the room. "What are you doing?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou came back to her senses. There were still faint sounds of that poignant drama coming through the wall so she gulped. "Uh, nothing much."</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, how bad did she expect Mu Ye's hearing ability to be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye had already noticed the vulgar sounds coming from next door when he entered. It was just that he hadn't expected Tang Doudou to be so bored as to stand here and listen to them...</span></p>
 <p><span style>His expression became a little unnatural. The rumors on the Jianghu really were true. Her conduct was sometimes, indeed a little... not enough like a virtuous lady.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye said, "If it's nothing, then let's go."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou replied 'oh,' then hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's wrong?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahem, why don't we save her?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Nangong Yan!" Tang Doudou really couldn't bear to just ignore this. Although it wasn't the first time between Nangong Yan and Liu Zhiyuan, Nangong Yan was an unwilling party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was hateful, the most loathsome person was Liu Zhiyuan. He was the most deranged person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A couple years ago, Nangong Yan was probably only around fifteen. That was the age where young girls longed most for a wonderful love. Right at that time, she ended up encountering someone as perfect as Baili Yu, so it was no surprise that she fell in love. When she failed to obtain him and decided to use desperate measures, not only did Liu Zhiyuan not stop her, he even took advantage of this chance to sully her body and her mentality. After taking the wrong step once, she ended up continuing to land on the wrong steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She fell in love with the wrong person and took the wrong path, so she was destined to have a pitiful life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her current personality and situation stemmed from Liu Zhiyuan's doings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His love truly was as Nangong Yan described, not only was it wretched, lowly, and shameless, it was even perverted!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye's gaze focused on her eyes. "Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can I tell you after you save her?" Tang Doudou curved her eyes. "You'll definitely find it interesting!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye slanted a look at her. "Not interested."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How do you know you're not interested before even hearing about it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye started walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily chased after him. "Hey, where are you going?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stopped and tilted his head. "To rescue."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou cheered then followed him to jump over the wall. In an instant, they landed in front of the house next door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye walked up without a pause and kicked down the wooden door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a burst of dust and splinters, but since Tang Doudou was hiding behind Mu Ye, none of it got on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who!?" There was the sound of Liu Zhiyuan's voice, followed by the rustle of clothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the dust settled and Mu Ye and Tang Doudou's figures were revealed, Liu Zhiyuan first looked stunned before his expression turned dark. He then pulled Nangong Yan into his arms and pressed a sword against her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't approach or I'll kill her!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou laughed. "You're using Nangong Yan to threaten me? Liu Zhiyuan, did you get out of bed head-first this morning? Damaged your brain?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Zhiyuan didn't speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She continued, "Aiy, actually, I'm just here to enjoy the show. You guys don't need to mind me! Go ahead and continue!"</span></p>
