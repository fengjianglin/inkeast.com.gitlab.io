 <p><b>Chapter 32: So What If I Did It On Purpose?</b></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu didn’t stay there for long before he lifted his foot and headed into Snow Gazing Courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin watched until he walked far away before hurriedly running to Tang Doudou’s side and checking her breath. Seeing that it was still pretty steady, he finally released a breath of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, he got ready to help push out the water in Tang Doudou’s lungs and stomach. After all, this incident was partially his fault. In reality, he was still concerned about Tang Doudou’s spicy strips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hands pressed down at her stomach area two times, then his face turned rigid. It’s really soft?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he never rubbed a woman’s stomach before, but he had often rubbed his own . Where was it this soft? When he doesn’t eat it’s all flat and hard, once he eats until full it’s also plump and hard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin suddenly narrowed his eyes and stooped down to look. This guy’s skin was like concentrated resin, his facial features delicate. With his red lips and white teeth, he seriously did look like a lass ah.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t be that he’s really a girl?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was really like that, then it might rather be a bit too interesting. Jun Xin rubbed his chin. Should he show his great benevolence and help Baili Yu examine and find out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hand paused in front of Tang Doudou’s chest. Jun Xin had second thoughts again. Master<span style="color: #99ccff;">(teacher)</span> said that between men and women, who is receiving and who is searching is not clear. If he places his hand down, in the one in a thousand chance that Li Xueyi really was a woman, then doesn’t that mean he had to take responsibility?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No no, this kind of troublesome thing, he better throw it to Baili Yu after all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Retrieving his hand stealthily, he slapped a couple pats on Tang Doudou’s face, “Hey hey, wake up! Wake up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’s already fine, why is he still not waking up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin called several times, but seeing no indication that Tang Doudou was about to wake up, he acted with a might-as-well mindset. So he tapped several acupuncture points on her body, then supported her up. After moving to her back, he raised his hand and swatted a palm onto Tang Doudou’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shit, who the hell hit her!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Tang Doudou’s consciousness was about to return, she was hit with Jun Xin’s palm. The enormous power also made her have an intimate kiss with mother earth. Adding on the residual effects of falling into the water, her heart, spleen and stomach all truly felt terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meow a miii, seriously. Tang Doudou slowly opened her eyes. After seeing the familiar ground did she realize she had been saved. Her intuition told her Jun Xin could never be that good-hearted, could it be Qing Yin?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turning around to look, what entered her eyes was Jun Xin’s particularly infuriating face. He was currently proudly blowing at his palm, completely ignoring the already awake Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This young master’s<span style="color: #99ccff;">(shao ye)</span> palm strength is just improving at an unbelievable rate with practice……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Practice…… urh……” You </span><i><span style>da ye</span></i><span style>*! Tang Doudou wanted to open her mouth and curse, but who knew the moment she opened her mouth, the latter three words were drowned out by a hot flood that surged out from her throat. With a ‘gurgle’ she vomited all over Jun Xin’s face.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">I think I’ve covered it in earlier chapters but cursing at someone’s relatives is common. Your mom is used most commonly alone, cursing at a particular action the other person talks about often uses other relatives. For this one, Jun Xin called himself ‘shao(young) ye’, which is young master, usually for the younger generation of a family. ‘Da(big) ye’ is kind of like big master, usually referring to the older uncles of a family, but is also a way for arrogant people who, often turn out to be just bigtalk and useless, to refer to themselves. Since I already got to here, ‘lao(old) ye’ is usually used for the current master of the family.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Originally when she first started vomiting, she did have time to turn her head to the side. But when she saw Jun Xin’s scoundrel appearance, Tang Doudou forcibly rushed towards that face. Only after she finished vomiting out the last drop of water in her mouth, did she wipe her mouth and say with a ‘hehe’: “I’m sorry ah, it wasn’t on purpose!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You! You completely did it on purpose!” Hearing Tang Doudou’s completely insincere apology, Jun Xin finally snapped out of his daze. Even the finger he had pointed towards her was shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did do it on purpose, but so what? Unwilling to accept? Unwilling to accept then come bite her ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou cast an extremely smug side glance at Jun Xin. In regards to vomiting all over his face, she was completely unapologetic. Who asked this despicable guy not to save her when she fell into the water?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin absent-mindedly wiped his face, feeling the nauseating smushiness, he immediately exploded, “Li Xueyi! This is how you repay your lifesaver!? If </span><i><span style>lao zi* </span></i><span style>knew earlier </span><i><span style>lao zi </span></i><span style>would have just let you drown!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">”lao zi” - father, daddy, “I, your father” (in anger or contempt), I (used arrogantly or as a joke). Sometimes, I’ll probably use ‘this daddy’.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>In any case, she was unconscious at that time and didn’t see that it was Bali Yu that saved her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who expected that Tang Doudou would actually give an exceedingly disdainful humph and directly expose his lies: “Do you even want face? How could it be possible for you to have that good of a heart to save me? You should just drop it. I would rather believe that the sun rises from the west before believing that you would save me! Heartless butt-aged brat! </span><i><span style>Xiao ye</span></i><span style><span style="color: #99ccff;">(little grandpa = I)</span> really made a wrong judgement, to believe that we could become friends. Treating you sincerely, even giving you spicy strips to eat. Never thought you were actually this type of person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This burst of words caused Jun Xin’s handsome face to turn flushed then pale, then from pale to red again. His neck even turned completely red, yet he couldn’t hold back his curiosity, “You, how did you know that it wasn’t me that saved you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Tang Doudou woke up, she felt horrid. Merely just the taste of falling into the water in the dead of winter was already unpleasant, adding on Jun Xin’s slap just then? It didn’t slap her straight to death but she felt like her five visceras and six bowels had been all struck out of place. If she still had the spirit to chat with Jun Xin right now, she would truly be disdaining that her life was too long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately pushed Jun Xin aside and shakily got to her feet, “Scram to the side, </span><i><span style>xiao ye</span></i><span style> doesn’t have time for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was the past, being shouted at by Tang Doudou like this, Jun Xin definitely would not have let her off easily. But right now, he actually didn’t refute even half a word but rather asked with concern: “Hey, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What eyes are you looking from to think that </span><i><span style>xiao ye</span></i><span style>, I, am alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun was glaringly bright, but with a breeze her entire body became even colder to the point she trembled. Tang Doudou’s teeth chattered. She just wanted to quickly leave this place, change out of her wet clothes, then snuggle into the blankets to warm up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the moment her feet moved, she nearly fell to the floor again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Misfortune never comes singly. This legs going soft symptom that refuses to come at better times has started up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Tang Doudou’s face and lips were the same color of paleness and that her hair and clothes were all dripping wet, emitting chill, Jun Xin hurried over to help support her. He slowly sent his inner strength circulating into her body, while asking in a soft voice: “Hey, is it a little better?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, he had some responsibility for this. He, Jun Xin, has always regarded responsibility as important. If it was his wrong then he would never try to deny it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling a warm flow enter her body, Tang Doudou had on an expression of wonder, so this the the legendary inner strength. On the other hand, she was also deeply moved that this Jun Xin’s conscience wasn’t completely gone. She’s such a big girl, so she won’t bicker with a little kid about that much. What’s more, she really couldn’t stand steadily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she seized the opportunity and leaned against Jun Xin’s body, “Little brat still has some conscience ah. But don’t waste time and inner strength anymore, if you have this strength then hurry and bring me to change my clothes. Could it be you fudging didn’t notice that I’m freezing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was called ‘little brat’ by her several times in succession. He couldn’t quite hold it back anymore and retorted: “You’re not allowed to call me little brat. I’m not little anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn’t have the time to debate with him over this, “Stop chitchatting, hurry and take me to change my clothes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok!” Out of the corners of his eyes, his gaze swept across the injury on her hand and saw that it had already been soaked by the water so much that it turned white and was curling up. Thus Jun Xin also didn’t dare to delay any longer. Even though Baili Yu isn’t scared of trouble, he, Jun Xin, is afraid ah. If it turns out that Baili Yu, that fox, foisted off all the responsibility of something happening to Li Xueyi onto him, then wouldn’t he have to deal with that entire bunch of people from the Alliance Head’s place when they come to cause trouble?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just thinking about it sounded frightening. He couldn’t help but feel a bit of sympathy for Tang Doudou. How could he be that out of luck, to be thrown over by the Cloud City Lord to be some pain-in-the-butt Alliance Head?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Tang Doudou tell what Jun Xin was thinking in his heart? Seeing that he didn’t move for a long time, she directly struck his head with her middle finger, “Hurry up and go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Qing Yin finally returned from going to get gauze. Seeing Tang Doudou’s wretched appearance, her brain couldn’t quite comprehend it for a moment. It had only been a few moments, what had happened?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou closed her eyes, out of strength, so she didn’t see Qing Yin’s arrival. When Jun Xin saw Qing Yin he shot a look at her, telling her to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin bit her lower lips, really wanting to head over to take a look at Tang Doudou. But in the end, she helplessly put down the gauze and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin stared at that gauze for a while before supporting Tang Doudou and starting to walk towards a direction, gradually leaving Snow Viewing Courtyard. Before he left, he extended a hand behind his back and sucked that gauze into his palm<span style="color: #99ccff;">(like The Force)</span>. Later when he needs to bandage the wound, he couldn’t very well walk all the way back here to get it, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After putting away the gauze, he lowered his eyes and discovered that at some unknown time Tang Doudou had fainted again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Please do not host elsewhere but Volare and Yumeabyss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recalling the situation he observed when his inner strength was circulating inside Tang Doudou’s body, he couldn’t help but sigh. Disseminating Tassel Fragrance sure was vicious; actually completely scattering all his martial arts, not leaving half a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Xueyi was ranked fifth in the Cloud City Martial Arts Circles. It is said that his martial arts skills were only below that of the Lord of Cloud City. He greatly received the City Lord’s favor and quite a few matters in Cloud City were given to Li Xueyi to handle. In the past there were even rumors that Li Xueyi may succeed the Cloud City Lord’s position, but unexpectedly just as these rumors were heating up, it was announced that the City Lord was sending Li Xueyi to take up the Alliance Head position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towards this person, Li Xueyi, there were a lot of rumors about him in the Jianghu. Over half talked about how he committed this crime or that; it could be said that he was infamous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, he also was quite disdainful of this guy for using the fact that he had good martial arts skills to commit wrongdoings everywhere. But looking at it now, other than the fact that his mouth was a bit exceptionally stinky, he didn’t have any other obvious shortcomings. Why are there so many terrible rumors about him in the Jianghu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance caused his personality to undergo a huge change?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This also isn’t completely impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hey hey, what is he thinking about so much for? It’s not any of his business anyways. He only had to wait for this guy to wake up, recover, then think of a way to overcharge him and make him cook a meal for him. Those spicy strips were so tasty, others will definitely not be any worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking of spicy strips, Jun Xin suddenly recalled that those super spicy ones that Tang Doudou made for Baili Yu were still inside Moon Viewing Courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recalling that dreadful spicy taste… Ay, it can only be wasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking of which, Baili Yu had returned to Moon Viewing Courtyard. In the originally empty courtyard, in an instant it was filled up with quite a few people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A uniformly attired black-clothed group appeared then all knelt on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you finished investigated everything?” The moment Baili Yu stood inside the courtyard, the desolate courtyard immediately became as beautiful as a painting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The acting leader of the group reported: “We’ve finished investigating. Half a month ago Li Xueyi went to Azure Water valley and never left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye is still in Huai City and did not return to the Demonic Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That night, he was startled away by the Master of Rutaceae Pavilion. When Mu Ye went over, Li Xueyi had already lost all his martial arts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The subordinate narrated systematically and in full detail all the information he had to report. Baili Yu was silent the entire time until he got to the point where after Mu Ye left it seemed like Li Xueyi became an entirely different person. At that point, the expression in his eyes turned a bit complicated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though there are quite a lot of suspicious points that appeared in the current Li Xueyi, Bai Feiyun didn’t show the slightest sign of doubt. On the contrary, he still helped Li Xueyi over and over again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Getting to here, there were no more information to report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after a while did that subordinate speak again: “Master, should we keep a watch on this Li Xueyi? Jun Xin also seems to treat him a bit differently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu swept an indifferent gaze at him, unhurriedly saying: “It’s rare for Ah Xin* to get along well with someone, just let him do as he pleases. There’s no need to watch him. Anyways, with Ah Xin there, he won’t be able to cause any trouble.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #99ccff;">Putting Ah(阿) in front of someone’s name is a form of friendly endearment, often used towards someone younger.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Even though Jun Xin looks unreliable, in reality he had an innate gift of perception. Towards many things, he can see through them with just a glance, able to make decisive choices when facing matters. He was a very hard to come by seedling, Master<span style="color: #99ccff;">(teacher)</span> had said when he first handed Jun Xin to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that he was still young, so his personality was rather straightforward and simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, Baili Yu didn’t continue speaking. Those subordinates could only stay kneeling in their places, not even daring to twitch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Meng Yu carried out the pot, she was just in time to see the row of black-clothed men kneeling on the floor. Looking at Baili Yu who was standing in the courtyard with an unclear expression, she thought Baili Yu was angry and hurriedly with ‘thump thump thump’s ran to Baili Yu’s front. Wiping off the sweat on her forehead, she recalled what Tang Doudou said to her earlier and blurted out: “Master, Young Master Jun sneakily ate all the deer meat again!”</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #99ccff;">I probably should have explained this earlier, but I use parenthesis for short explanations of something I think may be confusing, a reminder, or my interpretation of the best explanation for a word that has multiple meaning. If I feel like it can’t be sum up in one or two words, I use the mini paragraph. I also use a mini paragraph once to explain terms that seem to recur. I leave it in a light color so you can just skip over if you’re not interested, I hope it’s not too distracting~</span></p>
