 <p><b>Chapter 209.2: The Ideal Life</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>But...</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, the two were sneakily lying on the roof of a certain kitchen. <span style="color: #008000">(P: oh no...)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>"They're not finished even after working on it for that long? I'm about to starve to death ah!" Tang Doudou had lifted up a tile to peek into the room. When she saw that the chef below was still bustling around, she gave a long sigh and plopped down on the roof. Lying flat on her back, she rubbed her stomach. "Poor baby is starving to death."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Baby?" Jun Xin glanced her stomach with a strange expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't think in weird directions, I'm also a baby, alright?" Tang Doudou declared forcefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. There was this way of speaking?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, it seems like it's done!" She had clearly been lying down, but she immediately turned around the instant the chef finished working as if there were eyes on the back of her head. She started drooling enough to make a puddle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin pushed her disdainfully. "Don't be so disgusting, alright? I'd like to see how you can eat later if your drool falls in!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uh..." It was true. She hastily wiped her mouth before she came back to her senses and said angrily, "This daddy wasn't drooling!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was just teasing you. The person's gone, let's hurry and get down!" Jun Xin pushed her again, then leapt off the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily got up as well. She walked forward a few steps before suddenly recalling that she couldn't use qinggong. How was she supposed to get down?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey hey, Jun Xin, wait for me ah!" She was filled with anxiety when she saw that the brat had already squeezed into the kitchen, but she didn't dare to make too much of a ruckus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, her gaze landed on a large tree on one side of the kitchen. The Heavens were truly merciful ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hastily climbed over and slid down the tree. She glanced around, and seeing that there was no one around, rushed into the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she entered, she saw that Jun Xin was in the middle of eating happily. Her anger rushed up at once and she said, "Butt-aged brat, you have no loyalty at all!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of her words were shoved back into her stomach by the food in front of her. "Hell, it's still Cloud City’s chefs that are most impressive!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she finished speaking, she picked up the chopsticks nearby and started fighting Jun Xin for food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stinkin' woman, you're snatching even when it's about to enter my mouth?" Jun Xin glanced angrily at the empty chopsticks near his mouth before shifting his gaze towards the woman that was currently covering her mouth as she ate the piping hot piece of food happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slowly lowered his chopsticks. He didn't eat anymore and just watched Tang Doudou make comments as she ate. He was thinking about how great it would’ve been if they were people from ordinary families.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just being able to watch her eat was already very satisfying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, why aren't you eating?" Tang Doudou only noticed after quite a while that Jun Xin had already put down his chopsticks and was staring at her without a word. She touched her face as she asked, "Is there something on me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was more puzzled than she appeared. After all, it was not the first time that Jun Xin had acted like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that he was still keeping some important information from her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was thinking through the possibilities, she heard Jun Xin sneer at her as he said, "Could it be that no one has ever expressed disgust towards your table manners? They're seriously too terrible to look at!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was speechless. She shot him a fierce glare, then paid him no more attention. She decided to eat her fill first. All she had eaten today was some of the pastries on the palanquin, and that was when she headed out early this morning. It was almost night now, so she was starved to the point where it felt like her chest was sticking to her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Someone come! Catch those thieves!" Tang Doudou was immersed in eating, and Jun Xin was engrossed in watching, when suddenly, a blood-curdling screech came from the entrance of the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crap, they had been discovered!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily threw away the chopsticks, stuffed another drumstick in her mouth, then pulled Jun Xin along to run towards the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop!" That person was trembling, but still stood in front of the door to block them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't be bothered to stop and try to reason with him. She had no desire for tomorrow’s headlines in Cloud City to be: The Young City Lord pilfered food and was caught red-handed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou picked up the stick nearby and said menacingly, "Move aside, or I'll beat you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her fierce manner frightened that person into taking a step back, which left a gap in the doorway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this, Tang Doudou laughed 'hehe,' then shoved the banknotes she had tucked away into that person's hands. "Money for the meal, money for the meal!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she pulled Jun Xin and ran off!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Money for the meal?" That person was left to stare blankly at the papers in his hand, then he threw them angrily on the floor!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He exclaimed indignantly, "As the grand Young City Lord, you actually brought someone here to break into someone's house and steal food!? It's intolerable!"</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: #3366ff">C: Feels like deja vu. Wasn't there a time Tang Doudou had to run away from a restaurant, and it turned out that the waiter was the restaurant's boss's lover? Ahh, like master like disciple hmm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #008000">P: "She was more puzzled than she appeared. After all, it was not the first time that Jun Xin had acted like this!" omg you clueless woman *facepalm*</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: #008000"> P: "Just as she was thinking through the possibilities" when you try to look for an ant that's a kilometer away, but it was right under your nose the entire time :/</span></p>
