 <p><b>Chapter 129.2: Taboo</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> has arrived!” said the manservant as he pointed towards the pavilion behind the rock garden in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou snapped out of her thoughts and looked in the direction he was pointing. The rocks blocked most of her view so all she could see was that there was a pavilion and a lotus pond on the other side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” Tang Doudou nodded towards the manservant, then headed towards the pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun’s face was extremely similar to Bai Feiyun’s and their figures were identical as well. When added on to the fact that they both tend to wear completely white outfits, it caused Tang Doudou to almost mistake the person that was sitting there, sipping on tea, for Bai Feiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao…” Before she even called out the name, she was jolted out of it by the scheming look in Gu Xun’s eyes. Tang Doudou coughed lightly and said, “Brother Gu sure knows how to enjoy life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It truly was very luxurious. Although the lotus pond was still full of withered stems and leaves, fresh green was already emerging from the weeping willows beside the pond. The scene of contrast was quite refreshing and beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter how good I am at enjoying life, I still can’t compare to Alliance Head Li. The sun haven’t even set, yet you’ve already gone to frolic among flowers,” said Gu Xun with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of puzzlement flashed through the depths of Tang Doudou’s eyes. How did he know that she had visited a brothel?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“‘The scent of the person’s fragrance arrives before the person herself’, this fragrance likely belongs to Lady Zhizhi of Phoenix Cloud House?” Gu Xun winked at Tang Doudou as he said, “Is this Gu correct?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing what Gu Xun said, Tang Doudou lifted her hand and sniffed her sleeve. However, she didn’t smell anything. Did this Gu Xun have the nose of a dog?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alliance Head Li, please sit and sample this Mist Mountain <span style="color: #0000ff">(green)</span> Tea. It took me quite some effort just to obtain this little bit. Speaking of which, it’s really such a coincidence. You happened to arrive right after I finished brewing it.” Gu Xun greeted her very amiably, but it had the effect of making it hard for Tang Doudou to state what she came here for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought a little, then sat down opposite Gu Xun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun poured a cup of tea and pushed it to Tang Doudou. The steam of the tea swirled slightly as it rose and a refreshing scent entered her nose. Even without tasting it she could tell that this was good tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though she wasn’t very knowledgeable about tea, back in the modern era when she had free time, she liked to brew a cup of green tea as she read a book or surfed the web on the porch. The feeling was terrific.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Collecting her thoughts, Tang Doudou lifted the tea and took a light sip. As the tea entered her stomach, the fragrance wound around her tongue. It was truly refreshing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wonderful!” exclaimed Tang Doudou in admiration as she put down the teacup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Joy appeared on Gu Xun’s face. “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This reaction of his was a little strange ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou took another sip and nodded with a smile. Her gaze didn’t shift away from Gu Xun the entire time as she deliberated on how to set about achieving her goal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After obtaining another confirmation from Tang Doudou, Gu Xun was so happy he was practically about to leap up and dance. Though he didn’t do that, he insisted on playing the flute for Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was dumbfounded, a bit confused as to why Gu Xun was so excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t keep it from Brother Gu, I’ve come this time because I have something I’d like to ask Brother Gu to help with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sitting through a burst of enchanting music, Tang Doudou finally could not endure the torment anymore and told Gu Xun what she came for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Gu Xun lowered the flute from his lips and looked at Tang Doudou in surprise. “What matter is it? Is it something that the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce can’t solve?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seriously, probably all the people in the world have already labeled her as part of the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem, this is something related to my Alliance Head Residence and also a personal matter. It has nothing to do with the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so it’s like that.” Gu Xun nodded. “Since it’s Alliance Head Li’s personal matter, then this Gu would like to hear the details.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was silent for a bit, then she got straight to the point. “Brother Gu has been in Mist City for many years. Do you know Lady Qian of Five Kilometers Emporium and the old man that lives there? Who are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Qian? Old man?” Gu Xun mulled over these words. After thinking for a while, he revealed a troubled expression. “If you’re talking about old men that live in Five Kilometers Emporium, there’s plenty of them, but this Lady Qian is probably a woman, right? How could there be a woman in Five Kilometers Emporium? Alliance Head Li, did you get tricked by someone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Gu Xun’s manner was pretty convincing, Tang Doudou was confident that he was lying. If he was telling the complete truth, why would he be fiddling with his flute?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know much about psychology but she would occasionally read about popular scientific discoveries. It was said that when people lied, they would often start making some small movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier, when Gu Xun was speaking, his palm had been placed lightly on the table. Once she brought this matter up, however, he started making this little movement. This was proof that he was definitely not telling the truth right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Tang Doudou didn’t call him out on it. She calmly lifted the tea and took another sip. This tea was truly unbelievably fragrant. One sip led to the urge to take another sip, it felt almost addicting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Brother Gu doesn’t know who those two are, could Brother Gu help me find out about them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing this, Gu Xun exposed a troubled expression. “This…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Gu should just say things straight out. It’s fine if you truly cannot help, I can just go ask other people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s actually not a problem to find out about this matter but, I won’t keep it from Alliance Head Li, Five Kilometers Emporium is now a taboo subject in Mist City. It’s still alright right now but if the people from the City Lord Residence found out that someone wanted to investigate this matter, even if you guys are the Heng Xuan Chamber of Commerce, you’ll still be driven out of Mist City!” Gu Xun gave a long sigh, then poured another cup of tea for Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knitted her brows upon hearing this. Why would it be like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t Five Kilometers Emporium just a worn out street? What exactly did it contain to cause the Lord of Mist City to declare it a taboo topic?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not just that,” said Gu Xun with his voice lowered. He glanced around, then continued, “I heard that the City Lord is cleaning up all the people that have been to Five Kilometers Emporium before…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Tang Doudou was extremely shocked. “You’re saying that he killed all the beggars that managed to escape from the fire?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiy, precisely. Could it be that Alliance Head Li didn’t notice? There are barely any beggars in Mist City anymore. Regardless of whether they’ve been to Five Kilometers Emporium or not, they’re all being secretly disposed of,” said Gu Xun with a sigh as he shook his head.</span></p>
