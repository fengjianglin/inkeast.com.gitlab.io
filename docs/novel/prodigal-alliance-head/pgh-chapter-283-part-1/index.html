 <p><b>Chapter 283.1: How Was She Supposed to Consummate?</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had gotten used to Baili Yu messing around and teasing her, so when he reached out to hug her, she didn't react much and continued wondering why he was acting so strange. In the end, she only snapped back to her senses when her lips had been plundered so much that she ran out of breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she had been lost in thought, she had been pushed onto the large bed that had been behind them. Baili Yu's movements hadn't stopped and his hand was currently slowly traveling down her body. Tang Doudou hastily pressed his hand and told him to stop, but all that came out of her covered lips were muffled sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she realized that Baili Yu didn't seem to be joking around, she became completely flustered and pushed him away. "Baili Yu! Don't do that!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu swayed and almost fell off the bed from her shove, so she hastily pulled him back. "What's wrong with you? Do you remember who I am?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu didn't react at all and just looked at her vacantly for a moment before reaching out to hug her again. He looked like a puppet that was moving on strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how oblivious Tang Doudou was, at this point even she was able to notice that something was off. She hastily dodged Baili Yu's embrace and jumped off the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yu saw that she was running, he sluggishly turned around, then ran after her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Tang Doudou's reaction was to run. As she ran, she shouted, "Big evil spirit, don't you dare come over here! Otherwise, don't blame me for not bothering to be polite!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu didn't seem capable of hearing anything right now and just continued to follow her tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou tried hiding behind the screen, but he continued following. When Tang Doudou ran, he ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou ran in circles around the screen, Baili Yu did so as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After making several circles, Tang Doudou was exhausted, so she started running in a different direction. However, after a few steps, she noticed that Baili Yu wasn't following.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she looked over, she discovered that he was still running in circles around the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou pressed a hand against her forehead as she sat down next to the table, exhausted. She poured herself a cup of water, but discovered that it was wine after she drank it in one gulp. That burning sensation traveled all the way down to her stomach. It was so acridly refreshing that she almost vomited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hastily picked up a fruit from the fruit platter and shoved it in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took a good while to calm the churning in her stomach. When she looked over, she saw that Baili Yu was still going in circles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin. Baili Yu's behavior was definitely not due to poison. It seemed more like he had fallen to some sort of spell. The Seven Great Saint Tribes were extremely mysterious, so it wouldn't be strange for them to have some sort of ancient dark magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the main question was, who had done this to Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first person that came to mind was Lan Jia, and he was the only one she could think of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, though he said that he was good friends with Baili Yu, no one knew their actual relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what was Lan Jia's goal in doing this? And he had said that Baili Yu was going to marry some Saint Maiden, so how did she end up becoming Baili Yu's bride?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, it was best to focus on getting Baili Yu back to normal before trying to figure all those other things out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as he got back to normal, they would be able to figure out Lan Jia's motive and leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou reached this conclusion, she stood up and walked towards Baili Yu. He was still acting as foolish as earlier. She was no longer there, but he was still running in circles continuously and almost knocked into the corner of the screen several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw this, she felt strong heartache and hastily called out to stop him. "Baili Yu, stop running around over there. I'm over here!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after she called out to him, Baili Yu turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I-I'm here, so come chase me!" After shouting that, Tang Doudou jumped up and started running. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu naturally started chasing after her again. After making a few laps around the room, Tang Doudou returned to the screen area. This time, she didn't run for long before stopping with a wooden box in her hands. She had grabbed it from the dressing table as she passed by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu saw that she had stopped, but it had happened too abruptly for him to react in time, so he crashed straight into the wooden box that Tang Doudou was holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was still for a few moments, then a trace of clarity appeared in his originally dull eyes. Immediately after that, his eyes rolled back and he collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily threw aside the wooden box in her hand and ran over to catch him. "He's finally passed out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hauled Baili Yu over to the bed, then leaned over the bed to examine Baili Yu as she rested a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His familiar features momentarily caused Tang Doudou to space out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had only been a few days since they had last seen each other, but it felt like it had been countless seasons. She reached out and lightly touched his eyelids, then sighed. Who would have imagined that when they met again, it would be under such circumstances?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her fingers slowly moved down, brushing against his high nose, scarlet lips... The memory of his smile floated to mind. "Big evil spirit, you look the best when you're smiling."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she said that, she sighed again. She didn't even know why Baili Yu was currently like this, so how was she supposed to come up with a way to get him back to normal?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this moment, Baili Yu pressed his chest and groaned in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chest?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou patted Baili Yu's shoulder. "Relax, I'll help you take a look!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she said that, she reached out to push off Baili Yu's clothing. She had seriously become too worried, because she managed to take off his complicated bridegroom clothing in just a few moments. After pulling off his clothes, she saw that there was a strange, bluish black veined pattern on his chest that stretched all the way to his right wrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or, perhaps it should be said that it stretched from his right wrist to his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was stunned. Following that, tears filled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She recognized this veined pattern!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a symptom of the Hoarfrost Poison! That book had recorded that if the black veins appeared and spread to the heart, it meant certain death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black veins didn't spread very rapidly so Baili Yu definitely saw the signs a long time ago. He knew that he didn't have long to live, yet he never told her about it.</span></p>
