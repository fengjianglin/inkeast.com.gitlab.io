 <p><b>Chapter 174.2: Tree Valley</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hastily rushed out and caught up with Shen Moru. “She has a fever. Do you have medicine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the anxiety on his face, Shen Moru laughed strangely. Then he pointed at the village in front and said, “Let’s go, there’ll be a doctor to treat her in the village.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is this place?” Only then did Mu Ye realize with surprise that they were next to a very desolate cliff. Below the cliff was black soil and rubble. It was the color of coal that had been burned by a fire. Black leaves hung off the few withered trees and located within the black area were houses made of stacked stone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the center of that village was an unbelievably large tree with lush, dark green leaves that seemed to cover the skies. It was completely incompatible with the surrounding dark, ashy environment. It gave the feeling that all the nutrients here had been absorbed by this large tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru didn’t answer him and simply walked on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye was worried about Tang Doudou so he could only follow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they reached the village, he discovered that there were quite a lot of people in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all wearing the same black garment as Shen Moru. Regardless of whether they were young or old, male or female, they were all dressed in black and their facial features couldn’t be clearly made out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru led Mu Ye to the large tree in the center of the village. He sent out a palm strike and a long wooden ladder appeared from above. He jumped up and soon disappeared among the dense leaves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye also started climbing the ladder while carrying Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ladder went straight up along the tree trunk until it reached a point where three enormous tree branches diverged. There were simple wooden planks on it, and wrapped around the planks were vines that formed a large house. Shen Moru was standing at the entrance, and in front of him was an aged old lady wearing a black robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two were originally talking but when they saw that Mu Ye had come up, the old grandma looked towards the two. Her eyes lacked white and were a terrifying sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at Mu Ye for a long time. Her gaze seemed to sweep over Tang Doudou, then she spoke in a hoarse and unpleasant-sounding voice, “Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye didn’t move and simply looked towards Shen Moru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru said, “Go in. Grandma Shen is a Sky Doctor Saint Envoy. She can cure her illness and treat her wounds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a rare occasion, he didn’t make that eerie laughing sound. After he said this, he entered the house made from vines. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandma Shen was actually a Sky Doctor Saint Envoy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of astonishment flashed through Mu Ye’s eyes but it soon receded. He entered carrying Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put her there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Mu Ye entered, Grandma Shen spoke, pointing at the wooden plank in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye glanced at Tang Doudou and saw that her face was currently an unhealthy red. Her body temperature was so high that even he was starting to feel hot. He hastily put her down on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave,” said Grandma Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye frowned. Upon seeing this, Shen Moru said, “You won’t be able to help even if you’re here and will just end up affecting Grandma’s concentration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still felt uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s rare for me to do something with good intentions, don’t test my patience!” said Shen Moru, annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So Mu Ye left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after he walked out, he heard a ‘bang’ behind him. The door had been closed, but Shen Moru hadn’t come out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye didn’t know whether what he did was right or not. However, he didn’t dare take risks with Tang Doudou’s life. He found a concealed spot on the tree and sat down to adjust his internal energy. However, his attention didn’t leave that house for a second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the house, Shen Moru was sitting at the side with his legs crossed and his eyes closed. It was unknown what he was doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Grandma Shen knelt in front of Tang Doudou with a knife and chanted strange words with an expression of reverence. Then she kowtowed towards Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandma Shen, help treat her injury first. Even more blood is needed for the later parts. If she loses too much blood now and isn’t able to hold up until the end, all that work would have been for nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Grandma Shen’s muddy eyes revealed even more reverence. “Understood, the body must be cleansed before the wounds are to be treated. I’d have to trouble Saint King to withdraw.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru said ‘en,’ then vanished from the room like smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had a normal person seen this, they’d definitely faint from fright, yet Grandma Shen seemed to treat it as an ordinary sight. She unhurriedly stood up and walked with the crutch to the cupboard. With shaky hands, she pulled out the things for treating injuries, then pulled out some garments and placed them on the ground. After doing this, Grandma Shen called, “Maner, go prepare the medicinal bath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young girl who looked about sixteen rolled out from the dense leaves. She had a chubby baby face. Her mischievous large eyes rove around like that of a doll’s. She spotted Mu Ye who was standing in the shadows with a single look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her agate-like eyes immediately lit up. “Hey, man ah-yo! Where did you come from? You’re really good looking! Are you Grandma’s new guest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Mu Ye saw her naive and clear eyes, he was reminded of Tang Doudou’s similar charm and his cold eyes turned a little gentler. He replied softly, “En.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bell-like laughed spilled out from the young girl’s lips. “Heehee, I’m Nan Maner. You have to call me Maner, alright-yo? I’m Grandma’s granddaughter-yo. What’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maner, stop messing around and go prepare the medicinal bath!” Just as she was about to walk forward in order to get a closer look at Mu Ye, Grandma Shen’s displeased voice came from inside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maner pouted and replied unhappily, then shot Mu Ye a brilliant smile. “I have to help Grandma prepare the medicinal bath first-yo! Man, you have to wait until I come back-yo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye didn’t reply to her and instead looked towards the vine house. Medicinal bath?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou’s entire body was covered with wounds. Would she be able to endure a medicinal bath?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, these were clearly things out of his control. Nan Maner did things very quickly. Barely fifteen minutes later, she returned from beneath the tree, carrying an enormous cask. It was covered by a large wooden plank so the medicinal bath inside couldn’t be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a strange smell floated out from that cask. Mu Ye sniffed. This scent was a little familiar but he couldn’t recall what it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Nan Maner’s face was plump, her figure was abnormally petit. The black robe was too wide for her so she tied it up with rope, revealing a little waist that was the size of a palm. It was hard to imagine how she was capable of carrying this cask up with her slender arms and legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even he, this large man, would probably have to use a lot of energy. After all, this place was quite far from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she wasn’t moving slowly either. When she finished climbing up, she put the cask down and pushed a cart out from the room. Placing the cask on the cart, she hopped as she pushed it into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, she pushed the empty cart out again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she got outside the room, she tilted her head to think. Afterwards, she discovered that Mu Ye was staring at her the entire time and a bashful expression immediately appeared on her delicate face. “Man, you still haven’t told me your name yet-yo.”</span></p>
