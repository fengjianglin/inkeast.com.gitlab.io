 <p><b>Chapter 267.2: Where Did She Go?</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Shen Moru's neck was being choked, he was still able to speak. "Tang Doudou ah, Tang Doudou. If I die, you'll never be able to obtain those secrets again!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't you want to know who exactly you are?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't you want to know why you got poisoned with the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance, and why you suddenly disappeared?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And why you would become like you currently are now?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And there's Baili Yu, aren't you worried about his Hoarfrost Poison?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no change in Tang Doudou's expression, but she stopped tightening her hands. Her ice blue eyes swept over him indifferently before becoming filled with strong bloodthirst. "You talk too much!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru coughed out a mouthful of black blood. "As expected of a child of the Xuanyuan tribe, the reputation is not in vain!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, he turned into black smoke before recondensing at a distant place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou charged over and crushed Shen Moru who still hadn't fully condensed under her foot. "Die!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tang Doudou..." Just as she was increasing her strength to crush Shen Moru's skull, a gentle voice suddenly appeared in her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who?" She looked around but couldn't see anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's no point in searching, you won't be able to see me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you want?" Tang Doudou was very curious. Ever since she abruptly woke up earlier, the only voice she had been able to hear was Shen Moru's. She hadn't been able to hear or see anything else. </span></p>
 <p><span style>So it was hard not to be curious about this voice that had suddenly appeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"What I want? Won't you know once you come take a look?" said that voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where are you?" Tang Doudou took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Walk towards the left, all the way forward..." That voice seemed to contain some sort of demonic compelling force. Although she didn't want to go in the direction he gave, her legs started moving in that direction without her command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru got up from the ground and watched Tang Doudou's strange behavior with surprise in his eyes. A dagger appeared in his hand, but before he could act, a hand pressed against his shoulder. "Don't move."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Moru recognized this voice, so he didn't turn around. "Aren't you worried about getting retribution for doing this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're not afraid, so why should I fear it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you want?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why does everyone seem to like asking me this?" That person laughed lightly. "If you want to know, why don't you just follow and see for yourself?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said this, Shen Moru started walking forward blankly just like Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu was stunned to see the person that had suddenly appeared, but he didn't pause to ask questions and made to chase after Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person called out to him. "Brother Baili, please wait."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We'll talk when I get back!" Baili Yu glanced at him, uncertain of his intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mu </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> can handle following Lady Doudou. Brother Baili had better come with me to a certain place!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after that person spoke, Mu Ye nodded towards Baili Yu and headed off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lan Jia, you'd best explain yourself." Baili Yu turned around to face Lan Jia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia chuckled, then pushed Shen Moru aside. His shallow eyes that seemed clear were currently unreadable. "Brother Baili, could it be that you don't trust me anymore?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Trust must be built on reality. Reality has shown that the clue about Yiling that you gave me was wrong. Nangong Yan definitely isn't Yiling!" The moment Baili Yu recalled this matter, rage filled his eyes. That damned woman!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia seemed surprised. "She isn't? However, the only female infant that was brought back to Cerulean Mountain was her."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu was still worried about Tang Doudou so he didn't want to waste time arguing about this. He turned to continue walking without replying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he only managed to take a few steps before he was hit with strong dizziness. His footing became unsteady and he crashed straight to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lan Jia, you..." Before he even finished speaking, he fainted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia walked to Baili Yu and crouched down. Reaching out, he stroked Baili Yu's face as he remarked, "It sure isn't easy to knock you out. It took almost eight people's portions..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Mu Ye was chasing after Tang Doudou and heading towards the edge of the Sacred Tree. The further they went, the more serious his expression became, because there was not a single person around and no visible roads. The only thing ahead of them was an extremely deep abyss with billowing black smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye's gaze swept around. Where did she go?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky was still covered with crows so it was very dim and hard to see things. Mu Ye tried every single direction, and even questioned multiple people, but no one had seen Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could only return to the edge of the Sacred Tree. As he gazed at the billowing black fog below him, his eyes flickered with hesitation. Could it be that she's jumped into the Devil's Depths?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn't dare to try confirming this guess, because there was no fate other than death for those who jump into the Devil's Depths. Although she wasn't conscious, she should still be very sensitive to danger due to her inner strength exploding. Devil's Depths was surrounded by the black fog year round and filled with the scent of death. There was no way that she wouldn't be able to notice this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But... If she hadn't jumped into Devil's Depths, where did she disappear to?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye looked at Devil's Depths for a long time. Just as he prepared to descend a little to look for signs of her, he saw a trace of red out of the corner of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hastily went over and picked up that red item. It was the red string Tang Doudou had used to hang Baili Yu's thumb ring around her neck. It still contained the bound hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye abruptly looked towards Devil's Depths, then jumped in without any more hesitation.</span></p>
