 <p><b>Chapter 300.2: She’s His Wife</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already interacted with Baili Yu for a very long time, so mimicking his tone and voice wasn't difficult. In addition, Baili Yiling had only interacted with Baili Yu for a short time so she probably didn't remember his voice clearly either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, when Baili Yiling heard his voice, a sweet smile appeared on her face. "No! Big Brother, it's not late! Yiling's already really happy just to be able to see Big Brother!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw her smile, he faintly smiled as well, and that smile seeped into his voice, making it seem even more like Baili Yu's. "It's good that Yiling's happy."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big Brother, they bullied me." Baili Yiling's thoughts were jumping all over the place because she was only half conscious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't worry, Big Brother's here so they won't dare to bully you ever again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big Brother, I want to eat tanghulu."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big Brother, I want pretty clothes!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We'll buy."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Brother...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling started awake from her dream and her eyes darted around the room. However, all that entered her sight was an unfamiliar room. Where was her brother anywhere in sight?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that had felt so real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sighed softly and wiped away the sweat on her forehead. Was it Jun Xin that brought her back?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where was this place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She got off the bed and was just about to walk towards the window when she heard a clear voice come from outside. "Eldest Miss, are you awake?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eldest Miss?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling was stunned for quite a while before she finally realized that the person outside was addressing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, I'm awake. You are?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This servant is Qing Wu. Young Master Jun sent me to attend to you, Eldest Miss."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin sent her? To attend to her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eldest Miss? Had Jun Xin already announced her identity publicly? Why would he suddenly become so considerate?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eldest Miss, since you're awake, should this servant help you wash up?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling opened the door and took a look at Qing Wu. Qing Wu's conduct was natural and unrestrained, making her appear very much like a young miss. How did she look anything like a maid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's no need for you to attend to me. Just tell me where I should go to wash up." When Baili Yiling saw Qing Wu's looks, she thought that Jun Xin was purposefully sending this woman as a 'servant' to mock her so she became annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Wu's smile stiffened. She had no idea where she messed up to make this new master angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their new master really resembled Master too much. Those eyes were remarkably alike and caused her to instinctively fear their new miss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was inwardly thinking that this person really was Master's biological younger sister. The fact that she had a bad temper must run in the family, and no matter how terrible her temper got, it would still be better than Master's.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately smiled again and said, "Understood."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had no idea that Baili Yiling had taken in all of her tiny expression changes just now. Baili Yiling inwardly gave a cold humph and said, "Lead the way."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eldest Miss, please, this way..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humph! Jun Xin! You actually dared to treat this lady like this! You'd better watch your back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin who was currently watching over Tang Doudou suddenly sneezed. He rubbed his nose, then glanced over to check on Tang Doudou, who had fallen asleep again. Who was it that had such unhealthy interests as to curse him in the middle of the night instead of going to sleep?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn't be Baili Yiling, that damned girl, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When that girl's annoying face appeared in his mind, his face immediately darkened. Why did he remember that girl's looks so well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>En, it was because she looked too similar to Baili Yu. He had long gotten so used to Baili Yu's face that he was sick of it, so it was normal that it had been easy for him to remember that girl's face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He retrieved his thoughts and shifted his gentle gaze towards Tang Doudou again. "You ah, why do you always make people worry so much about you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If he's dead, so he's dead. There are plenty of good men in the world. Aren't you usually pretty open-minded? Why are you so fixated on him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you torment yourself this way and he finds out, he'd definitely die with his eyes still open from lingering regret."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He's so good-looking that his face is like a beautiful gem. If he dies with his eyes still open, that face will become ugly and unsightly. He'll bleed from all seven apertures of his head and his eyes will glower creepily..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He'll probably get scared to death by his own looks in the Yellow Springs. What do you think will happen to a ghost that dies?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wouldn't that ghost's soul disperse so that he can never reincarnate?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ha, you're sure good at talking!" A cold sneer suddenly came from the nearby window. "But, is there any use to you scaring her like this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin didn't need to look to know who it was. "Why are you here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If I didn't come, how long did you plan to keep it from me?" Feng Long jumped in with a laugh, but her hypnotic eyes were abnormally cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin pressed his lips together without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Long walked over with large steps and fiercely seized his collar to slam him against the bed pillar. "Speak! What exactly happened to Master? If it weren't for the fact that I heard about the eldest miss returning, how long were you planning to keep it from me!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin pushed away her hand, annoyed and sat back down next to the bed. "If you want to know, go ask Baili Yiling. I don't have the time to deal with you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Long was so angry her chest hurt. Master was dead, was he not hurt at all? Did he feel no sorrow?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin, Jun Xin, do you even still have a heart? (Jun Xin's name, xin = heart)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or was it that in your heart, no one other than the useless thing lying on the bed mattered!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'll kill her!" With how strong master was, how could he have died so easily? It was definitely because he had been trying to save this woman! Feng Long's eyes filled with murderous intent and a blade immediately shot out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin blocked the blade and sent Feng Long crashing to the ground with a strike. He stood up and towered over Feng Long as he said, "She has already gotten married with Baili Yu and is currently pregnant with Baili Yu's child. Do you still want to kill her after knowing this?"</span></p>
