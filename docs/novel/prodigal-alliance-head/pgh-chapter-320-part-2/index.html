 <p><b>Chapter 320.2: I Have Plenty of Money</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the song came to an end, Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> appeared in a light pink garment with peach flower embroidery. His outfit complemented his charming features and made him look particularly beautiful. He smiled softly and said, "Qing Cheng must first thank everyone for your longtime support of Wind Cherishing House. Many thanks." </span></p>
 <p><span style>After he finished speaking, he curtsied slightly to express his thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng? What a good name. Tang Doudou watched calmly as Qing Cheng curtsied like a daughter of a rich family. Inwardly, she felt like falling apart. This guy was as handsome as his name in terms of looks and temperament. He could attract countless admirers just standing there on the streets, but he just had to curtsy in such an incongruous way. It was so awkward to watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She recalled that Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> had said that Baili Yu had been personally trained by their boss. Did that mean that Baili Yu would also bow like this when he came out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fudge, that would be completely messing up her man! No matter how this ended up, she'd make sure to get back his dignity!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Next, we'll be inviting out our Escort Xue, Xue Mengyao." Qing Cheng had already finished his unending torrent of an opening remark while Tang Doudou was spaced out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Mengyao? Which idiot came up with this name? <span style="color: #3366ff">(Xue = snow, Meng = eldest amongst brother, Yao = one of the five legendary emperors)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou silently 'asked after' all eighteen ancestral generations of the person that came up with this name for Baili Yu even as she kept her eyes on the stage. When she had been at his window earlier, he had taken off his coat for her to wear. She hadn't paid attention to it back then so she wasn't sure what color it was, but it was probably crimson red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one in the world could compare to him in looks when he was wearing crimson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked pretty good in white as well. When he wasn't smiling, he gave off a very cool and indifferent aura that made everyone keep an instinctive, respectful distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he was wearing fiery red expressionlessly with only a hint of a smile in his eyes, it would be as captivating as a hypnotic flame. It was to the point that people would feel the urge to kidnap him back home in order to enjoy the view slowly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Haaa. Tang Doudou sighed. She had clearly seen it countless times already, so why did she still long to see more?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did she forget to tell him not to wear red earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She now regretted it a lot. If Baili Yu showed up in such alluring clothes, he'd probably captivate the entire hall of men!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If those men got over-excited and decided to bet their entire fortunes to obtain Baili Yu, she wouldn't be able to hold her ground with what she currently had!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it turned out that perhaps she and Baili Yu pretty good mutual understanding after all, because he slowly walked out from behind the curtains in a white outfit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His appearance was cool and indifferent as he glanced over at Tang Doudou. He stood there like a jade orchid tree, quietly without speaking a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng shot Baili Yu a displeased look, but Baili Yu didn't react at all. Annoyance flashed across Qing Cheng's face, but he still needed to rely on Baili Yu tonight for business, so he could only shelve his anger for now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn't they say that Escort Xue was an extremely alluring courtesan?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Baili Yu appeared, the hall became noisy with discussions again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He looks so cold, he's practically like an ice cube. I don't see what's so special about him."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"However, he really is so beautiful that he doesn't seem human."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No matter how beautiful he is, it doesn't matter. Only gentle touchable warmth is real!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Tch</span></i><span style>, you just don't get it. If you can push something this cold down and..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Bang</span></i><span style>!" The conversation was getting more and more vulgar. Tang Doudou couldn't stand it anymore and slapped the table. Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> started and shrank backward. What was this guest angry about now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're so noisy! It's not like anyone forced you to come here! If you're not willing to stay, then hurry up and scram!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her unrestrained shout annoyed a lot of people. The middle-aged man who had been talking the dirtiest stood up angrily. However, instead of shouting at Tang Doudou, he shouted at Qing Cheng. "Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, is this how your business treats its guests?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng didn't know what Tang Longbiao was angry about either and just thought that he was crazy. However, he had heard rumors that Tang Longbiao had been hanging out with Lin Shuxuan a lot, so he assumed that they were both sons from rich families that he couldn't afford to provoke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this Master Wang was also a frequent customer of Wind Cherishing House and couldn't be offended either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Qing Cheng was someone with a lot of experience. He soon reacted and walked to Master Wang with a smile. "Master Wang, please don't be angry. This Tang </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> is a loyal admirer of our Escort Xue. He must be unhappy since there's so much competition today and was trying to get rid of some competition this way &nbsp;You shouldn't fall for it!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he quickly whispered to Master Wang. "He's the one named Tang Longbiao that Young Master Lin has been inviting out to play every day. Master Wang should think things through."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Wang's facial color immediately changed when he heard this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng didn't stop in front of him for long. He soon moved towards Tang Doudou. "Tang </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, Qing Cheng knows that you're unhappy with this arrangement, but these rules are set by the owner. Although I'd like to fulfill you two, I don't have that ability. If </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> has true feelings towards Escort Xue, Qing Cheng would still give the same advice as before."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at him. Inwardly, she gave a cold laugh. As expected of the person in charge, he had been able to calm their tempers with just a few words.</span><span style>"This master is so poor that all he has left is money, plenty of money. I, Tang Longbiao, insists on taking Escort Xue today!" declared Tang Doudou. She shot a provoking look at Master Wang and gave a disdainful humph before sitting back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, she wasn't as crafty as Qing Cheng was making her out to be. All she wanted was to make those vulgar men shut up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she sat down, she said, "The spring nights are regretfully short, so Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> should hurry up!"</span></p>
