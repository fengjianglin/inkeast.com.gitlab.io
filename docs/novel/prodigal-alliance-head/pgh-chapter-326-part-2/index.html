 <p><b>Chapter 326.2: Was Taught by Me</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin froze, then he immediately laid down flat on the ground like he had just fallen there. "You must have saw wrong."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou approached him, then lifted her leg. Jun Xin hastily rolled to the side and got up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Again?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How come you can move after I sealed your pressure points?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin's eyes whirled, then he gave a dry cough. "I was the one that taught you how to seal pressure points. There's no reason for the teacher to be sealed by his student, you know?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glared at him. "</span><i><span style>Pei</span></i><span style>! So you didn't teach me a good method?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin just laughed. Tang Doudou couldn't stay angry at him with how he was acting. "Little brat, hurry up and undo the big evil spirit's seal."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin nodded. "Of course, but before I do that, let me check his pulse."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke in a serious manner, so Tang Doudou couldn't help but wonder if he was suspicious of Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what was he suspicious of?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, her eyes lit up. Could it be that Jun Xin thought Baili Yu was faking amnesia?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only reason she thought of it so quickly was because she was a little suspicious as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she turned and asked Baili Yu, "Why don't you let him take a look?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu just glanced at her without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jun Xin seemed to recall something and quickly ran over to strike a couple spots on Baili Yu's body before rapidly retreating again. When he saw that Tang Doudou seemed confused, he explained, "I acted too fast earlier and accidently sealed his voice."</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Tang Doudou didn't believe him at all. He had clearly sealed Baili Yu's voice on purpose so that he couldn't wake her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Baili Yu's voice was unsealed, he coughed before saying in a low voice. "I don't want him to check."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you won't let me check, then I won't unseal your pressure points!" The only thing Jun Xin was relying on was the fact that Baili Yu had lost his memories and his martial arts. Otherwise, in the past, no matter how fearless he was, in front of Baili Yu his tails would always be tucked between his legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu glanced at him indifferently. His tone was calm to the point it chilled. "I'll remember this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin's heart jumped nervously, but he refused to admit defeat. "So what if you remember? Who's scared of you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large sweatdrop slid down Tang Doudou's forehead. Baili Yu was clearly holding a grudge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"D-don't be like this..." When she saw that the atmosphere was turning bad, she had no choice but to try and mediate them. "Look, you guys grew up together like siblings. Just discuss things calmly, alright?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jun Xin, you should stop making a fuss too over checking his pulse and stuff. We can just wait until we get back for a specialist to check. You've said so yourself that you don't know much about medicine, what would you be able to find?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big evil spirit, you shouldn't be so petty either. Jun Xin's here to help us, and I owe him a lot. If it weren't for him, I would already be reporting to the King of Hell, so you shouldn't hold a grudge against him, alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin yawned unhappily. "Fine, whatever you say. Humph... This little master doesn't want to deal with so many troublesome things either. I'm going to sleep."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked towards the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou felt pretty apologetic as well since Jun Xin seemed to really have gotten angry. However, Baili Yu's pressure points were still sealed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jun Xin." Although she hadn't wanted to call out to him, she still did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It'll undo on its own after four hours."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows and looked towards Baili Yu helplessly. "Then let's wait four hours? I'll carry you to the bed. It'll be more comfortable to lie down."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu smiled. "There's no need."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou frowned. "We still need to travel later tonight. Don't push yourself."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's no need to wait four hours, it'll only take a little while."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Really?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then alright, I'll believe you this once."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind the screen, Jun Xin's eyes widened when he heard this. It'll only take a while? Was Baili Yu planning to break the seal on his own?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But his martial arts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shifted quietly to peek outside only for the scene of Baili Yu and Tang Doudou gazing passionately into each others' eyes to come into view. He hastily drew back and silently rebuked himself for being stupid enough as to torment himself. Why had he agreed to help her look for Baili Yu back then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He should have just kidnapped her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That way he wouldn't have to see them flirt all the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He closed his eyes, vexed. What was the point of thinking about this? Once this matter was resolved, he'll have Baili Yu help him get back to Wind Cloud Island. Then once he settled the matter involving his parents, he'll start traveling the world and never deal with these messy things again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She too, he'll bury deep within his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to let go sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu hadn't lied. After a short while, his body relaxed. He lifted his arm and stretched before sitting down on a nearby chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was excited, but then she glanced at Baili Yu weirdly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want to ask me how I was able to undo it, right?" Baili Yu glanced towards the screen. His voice contained mirth as he said, "That's because when he said that he was the one who taught you to seal pressure points, I suddenly remember that I was the one who taught him how to seal pressure points."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou burst out laughing. Her eyes darted towards the screen as well. "If Jun Xin was awake and heard this, he'd definitely puke blood from anger."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind the screen, Jun Xin had already closed his eyes. However, when he heard this exchange, his eyes abruptly shot open. He really did feel like puking blood. How had he forgotten this!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after Baili Yu said this, Jun Xin became even more certain in his conjecture. There was definitely something fishy with Baili Yu's claim of amnesia!</span></p>
