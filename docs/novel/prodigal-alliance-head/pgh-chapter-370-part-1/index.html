 <p><b>Chapter 370.1: Leaving</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You know him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you forget?" When Tang Doudou saw the dead person on the ground, she was finally struck with the feeling that the situation was serious. She pulled at Baili Yu's arm. "He's Xiao Ziyu, the guy that helped Nan Maner that time in the inn!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Someone of the Xiao family," murmured Baili Yu. His brows furrowed slightly, but then soon relaxed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Ziyu's status in the Xiao family wasn't low. It was apparent from his way of speaking, the things Nangong Yan had said to him before, and the information he held that he was probably of the direct line of descent in the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was no small matter for some of the direct line of descent to die in broad daylight on the streets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you see who it was that did it?" Although she didn't know Xiao Ziyu very well, Nan Maner seemed to have feelings for him. Nan Maner would definitely be sad to find out that Xiao Ziyu had died, so at the very least, she should figure out the situation to give Nan Maner the concrete facts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu shook his head. "I hadn't expected for something like this to happen and was only focused on playing with you earlier."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn't you say earlier that they were targeting Fu Yunliu? Do you think Fu Yunliu's the one that did it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It doesn't seem like it," said Baili Yu. "The injuries on the victim doesn't reflect Fu Yunliu's martial arts style."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou heard this, she gathered up her courage to look towards the corpse again, but she didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. The only impression was that the murderer was terribly vicious, the body was completely in tatters from all the wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two were speaking, the street became even more deserted. Baili Yu reached out and pushed open the window behind them, then pulled Tang Doudou inside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This seemed to be the guest room of an inn. It was kept tidy but there was no one inhibiting it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu treated it like his own house. After walking around and inspecting the place, he poured a cup of tea and handed it to Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was still mulling over Xiao Ziyu's death. When a cup of tea was suddenly offered to her, she peered at it warily. "Is it alright to drink this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Inns must be prepared to receive guests at all times, so they change out the teas in the guest rooms very frequently. There's no need to worry." Baili Yu had her drink some tea and rest, then headed back to the window to open it a crack. He stayed by the window to observe the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't bring herself to go look at the corpse again. After drinking the tea, her mind started to whirl with thoughts. She then remarked, "The person who killed Xiao Ziyu sure has guts! The four large clans aren't easy to deal with, this will probably stir up quite a big disturbance."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who exactly was it that killed Xiao Ziyu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you think it's Nangong Yan? Xiao Ziyu had offended her quite a lot while defending Nan Maner, and there's no way she'd let it rest with her personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Or it might be something the four large clans did. In the past, Xiao Bai… No, Bai Feiyun said that although the four large clans seem to get along well, they actually plot against each other a lot. Perhaps Xiao Ziyu had been assassinated by someone those three clans sent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But what's the motive? There's no way they'd kill without a reason, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The other possibility is that Xiao Ziyu had provoked someone that he shouldn't have!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey! Baili Yu, what are you looking at? Why aren't you talking?" Tang Doudou had been mulling over it by herself while drinking tea. The conclusion she came to was that she really didn't know the four great clans well enough to figure out the situation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When she called for Baili Yu, Baili Yu turned around and made a shush motion toward her, then beckoned her over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw Baili Yu's cautious expression, she quickly jogged over so that she wouldn't miss out on what was happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She peeked out through the crack in the window and almost cried out in alarm again. She hastily covered her mouth, then exclaimed softly, "How did the corpse disappear?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Someone took it away." Baili Yu closed the window with a grim expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou noticed and reached out to stroke his furrowed brows. "What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That person is very strange." Baili Yu caught Tang Doudou's hand and rubbed it as he thought about things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you mean by strange?" Since it was something that actually managed to trouble Baili Yu, Tang Doudou immediately became interested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu didn't plan to tell her about it here. After all, they had come out here today to play, but after this incident, she probably wouldn't be in the mood to play anymore, so he said, "Let's head back to the valley first. I'll tell you about it once I figure out the specifics of the situation."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou considered it for a moment, then agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really wasn't in the mood to continue playing. She was troubled about how to tell Nan Maner about this incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she didn't think deeply about it, she still had a strange premonition that something huge was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once they got back to Azure Water Valley, they stayed for about a week without anything happening. Just as Tang Doudou was starting to think that she would be able to stay here until the child was born, a lot of uninvited guests appeared in Azure Water Valley.</span></p>
