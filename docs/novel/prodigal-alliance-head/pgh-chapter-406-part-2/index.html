 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 406.2: Can't Be Cured </strong></u></span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he felt her pulse, his facial color changed drastically and became completely white. He flung off Tang Doudou's hand and stood up. "How could it be this poison!? How's that possible? How…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>His repeated cries of disbelief were enough to show that this poison was going to be a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice even became a little flustered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Cang…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't talk!" Cang Baicao stopped Baili Yu's questions and started pacing around the room anxiously while muttering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu had pinned all of his hope on Cang Baicao, so although he was impatient, he had no choice but to remain silent as to not interrupt Cang Baicao's thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Cang Baicao stopped and stood in front of Baili Yu. His haggard face was filled with strong helplessness. Baili Yu's heart dropped. Could it be that even Cang Baicao couldn't do anything about this poison?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can't cure this poison!" Cang Baicao took in how Baili Yu's body trembled from shock when he heard this. After a moment, he continued, "But there's someone that can."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hope reappeared in Baili Yu's eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao said, "But there's not enough time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn't there anything that can slow the spread of the poison?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There isn't!" Cang Baicao shook his head firmly. When he saw the despair on Baili Yu's face, he hesitated, but still said, "Baili <em>gongzi</em>, there's something I'm not sure I should say."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu was currently very flustered and vexed. If Cang Baicao wasn't capable of curing this poison, who would be able to cure it? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would he help?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if he helped to cure this poison, wasn't that the same as admitting that he had poisoned her? He wasn't dumb enough to do that, so there was no way he'd agree to help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Baili Yu thought about things, the more exasperated he got. However, he couldn't very take his anger out on Cang Baicao, so he just said, "Senior Cang, feel free to say it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En. Baili <em>gongzi</em>, remember what I said about the child last time?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Cang means?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There will be more children, but if this poison remains in her body too long, no one can know for sure what will happen. You understand?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pain filled Baili Yu's eyes. "Isn't there any other way?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that was their first child!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao shook his head and continued taking Tang Doudou's pulse. "Think about it. You've suppressed the poison with your inner strength, so you have one day's time to consider."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu looked at him, then slowly closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there were any other ways, even if it required for him to make use of everything including his own life, he'd do it without hesitation to protect the mother and child. However, there was no way, so what could he do? In this moment, he actually felt so helpless. It was the first time he had ever felt helpless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked outside dispiritedly. He really needed time to think about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao didn't stop him and allowed him to leave. Once he got far away, Cang Baicao's expression suddenly changed and a pill rolled out of his sleeve into his palm. He quickly fed it to Tang Doudou, so quickly that his movements were barely visible. When one looked again, his fingers were still on Tang Doudou's wrist and his eyes were mostly closed as if he was examining something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Yin, who was outside, saw this, but it had happened so quickly that she thought she saw wrong. She retrieved her gaze and continued guarding the door quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azure Water Valley, along with Baili Yu, sank into a deadlock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Baili Yiling, who had headed over with the Wind Shadow guards to find Jun Xin, had already arrived in North Hara City. It was already night, so she was exhausted. She talked with the leader of the Wind Shadow guards and had them go look for Jun Xin first. She was going to rest until midnight, then follow the signs that they left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, right after she entered the inn, the Wind Shadow guards came back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you guys back here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Replying Eldest Miss, we've discovered Young Master Jun's tracks!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yiling heard this, she immediately became more alert and hastily asked, "Where is he right now?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard replied, "According to what we've found, Young Master Jun went to a high ranking official's residence, but we didn't find any trace of him inside."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Maybe he's already left?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We didn't see any evidence that he left. He seemed to have disappeared in there."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are there any other information?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, then you guys can withdraw. I'll call you if I need anything else."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Understood!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Wind Shadow guards left. Baili Yiling propped up her chin and thought about things for a while, then decided to go and take a look for herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had witnessed the Wind Shadow guards' skill at tracking on her way here. If they've determined that Jun Xin had disappeared in that residence, then it was definitely true. However, the fact that a large man disappeared so suddenly just like that meant that there was definitely something up with that residence!</span></p>
