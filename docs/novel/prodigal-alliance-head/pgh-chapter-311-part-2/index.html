 <p><b>Chapter 311.2: Setting Off</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it? You're smiling so much, that means you got definite news?" Although she was smiling when they came, the smile didn't reach the depths of her eyes. However, after coming back from where Mu Ye brought her, she was lit up with smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sat down next to him and then copied the way he was lying down. Her eyes curved into a smile as she said, "That's right, I got news. He's fine."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Happy?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Happy."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Won't die anymore?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Won't die anymore."</span><span style>"Alright, talk, what do you want to do?" Jun Xin flipped around to face Tang Doudou, his eyes flickering with light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou yawned without looking at him. "I'll go by myself."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you feel like I'd agree?" Jun Xin gave a disdainful humph.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou really wanted to give this kid a beating. If it weren't for the fact that she couldn't beat him...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can't allow anyone to find out about Baili Yu and two people would be too conspicuous. It'd be much easier for me to travel alone and... you have to help me get rid of those tails from the shadows." Tang Doudou turned around and patted Jun Xin's chest. "Stinkin' brat, this is a really important matter, you'd better help me properly!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, it's too worrying."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is a crucial time, so don't be so spoiled and stubborn." Tang Doudou rolled her eyes as she continued, "We're the only ones that can know about this, so help me, alright?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin bit his lips. Spoiled and stubborn? Was this the way she viewed him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fine, I'll help!" His eyes then whirled with an idea. "But you have to promise me something."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As long as you help, I'd agree even to ten conditions."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then let's elope?" Jun Xin laughed. When he saw that Tang Doudou's expression was rapidly turning dark, he quickly changed his tune. "I'm just joking, don't take it so seriously!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tch! I wasn't taking it seriously."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There's no way I'd be able to relax if you go by yourself. Since you're worried about your whereabouts being revealed, I'll just protect you from the shadows. How's that?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glanced at him. If she didn't agree to this suggestion, he'd probably lock her up to keep her from heading out alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fine, fine."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's more like it. I'm telling you, before we find Baili Yu, you should give up all hopes of shaking me off," stated Jun Xin firmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he got up and flicked off the leaves on his clothes. Licking his lips, he said, "We can't delay this matter, so let's head back to Huai City today. Once I finish dealing with the most pressing tasks, you should sneak out of Plum Garden and I'll follow you from the shadows."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two rushed back to Plum Garden. Tang Doudou found some time to go see Baili Yiling, but when she saw that Baili Yiling was still busy, she only chatted a little before she left and returned to her own room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she waited for news from Jun Xin, she started wandering around the room. Jun Xin had told her that he had put her box in a cabinet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After rummaging through the room for a long time, she finally found the wooden box that was wrapped in a wedding garment in the cabinet that contained her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw the red garments, she couldn't help but feel sad. However, she soon recovered and nimbly untied the garment to open the box. It still contained the same things that she had seen in the hidden room. She fiddled with them, but couldn't figure out how to cure the Hoarfrost Poison with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, for the time being, she decided to keep them with her since Baili Yu would probably know how to use them when she found him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was in the process of putting them away with Jun Xin came back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw that she was putting away the things in that box, he said with a laugh, "Back then, you were clutching that box so tightly that I thought it was Baili Yu's ashes!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blabbermouth of a stinkin' brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou glared at him. "Always talking nonsense."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin laughed. "Everything's ready. You can slip out tonight."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded. "Alright, thanks!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you want now?" She could tell he was up to something just by the way his eyes rolled around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin licked his lips. "After you head out this time, it'll probably be a while before you have a chance to cook again, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, he was thinking that even after they found Baili Yu, she probably wouldn't have time to cook again. In addition, it really wouldn't be right for him to keep hovering around her once Baili Yu came back because she was already married.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knew that it would be about food. She put the box away, then stood up and slapped the table. "Let's go, chowhound!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin smiled slightly. "This way, Chef."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou prepared a large feast for Jun Xin and fed him until his stomach turned completely round before he was satisfied enough to let her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was afternoon, she took a nap, and when she woke up again, it was already night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She got up and ate the meal the servants had brought over, then picked up the cloth bundle she had prepared. She had already extinguished the candles, so once she was ready, she quietly climbed out from the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin had already arranged for the hidden guards near her courtyard to be in other places, so even if she swaggered out, no one would see her. However, for the sake of making the act complete, she tiptoed out of the courtyard and quickly jumped over the tall wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she got out of Plum Garden, she left Huai City on horseback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin was dressed in black and wearing a silver mask as he followed her from the shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou decided to head to Dream Mountain first. It was fortunate that she had taken a nap in the afternoon because now she could travel through the night. She reached the inn right before dawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shopkeeper? Waiter?" She entered the inn but didn't see anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had only been gone for a day. Where did all the people go?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The inn was still unrepaired. Could it be that they had gone into town to find someone that could fix this place up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou casually picked a room and went to sleep. When she woke up again, it was near night. She ate a bit of dry rations and was just about to continue traveling when someone appeared in the room.</span></p>
