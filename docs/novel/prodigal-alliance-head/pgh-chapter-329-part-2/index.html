 <p><b>Chapter 329.2: Goal Achieved</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lin Shuxuan finished listening to all of it, he nodded. "Alright, I'll help you arrange that right now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Many thanks, Brother Lin!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Although you're the martial arts alliance head, to me, you're still that refreshing and straightforward Brother Tang." Lin Shuxuan's gaze was bright as he lowered his head and gradually leaned closer to Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou silently cursed. So it turned out that this silk pants </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> had approached her with lustful intentions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She discreetly pushed him away as she exclaimed, "Oh no, I have to hurry and rush back. Brother Lin, I'll be counting on you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan said, "Alright, then be careful."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou quietly returned to the nearby room. Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was still calling, but his voice was very hoarse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>! You can stop now." Tang Doudou picked up the clothing on the ground and climbed onto the bed. Then she untied the waist belts wrapped around Lian </span><i><span style>er'</span></i><span style>s eyes and mouth as she said, "Let's go, it's about time for us to head back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s eyes were completely red and swollen like balls. When he saw Tang Doudou, he pressed his lips together and tears started falling like a faucet was turned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou made a sympathizing expression as she patted his shoulder. "Stop crying. Look, just by crying for a while, you got the chance to leave Wind Cherishing House. That's a really good exchange, isn't it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> glanced at her tearfully. "En."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, alright, put on your clothes and let's leave."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they got back to Wind Cherishing House, Gu Xun ran over anxiously. "You're finally back! If you didn't return soon, we would've missed the timing!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou first had Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> leave, then she pushed open the door to Baili Yu's room. When she saw that he was still sleeping, she walked back outside with a smile and asked, "How much longer until we can head out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun furrowed his brows. "If you guys are ready, we can leave at any time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, I'll go wake Baili Yu up now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then I'll go prepare as well. Once I finish preparing, I'll immediately arrange for someone to send you guys out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded. After taking a few steps, she paused and said, "Oh, that's right. Boss Gu, I want to buy Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>. How much would it cost?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want to buy him?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun was confused. Could it be that she really has taken a fancy to Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou naturally had her own reasons for doing this. The less she explained, the harder it would be for Gu Xun to guess what she was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, I promised Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> yesterday that I would pay his ransom, so Boss Gu, I'll have to trouble you to bring his contract over!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun hesitated for a moment as if he wanted to advise her against it, but then he thought better of it and just nodded before instructing someone to get Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>'s contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou skimmed over the contract. When she saw that the contract stated that Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> started working here at the age of seven, several of her questions were cleared up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she had expected, these courtesans hadn't grown up here as they had claimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li, the fact that you like Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> is his fortune. Moreover, it's just a little courtesan. There's no need to be polite with me and talk about money. Just treat it as a gift from me," said Gu Xun with a laugh as he offered her the contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Tang Doudou didn't want to take it and wanted Gu Xun to hand it directly to Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, but when she saw that Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> was eavesdropping downstairs, she changed her mind and took it. "Then Xueyi won't be polite!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun left with a smile to finish the rest of the preparations. Tang Doudou watched him for a while, then turned back to enter the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Have you gotten everything you needed?" Baili Yu was standing in the room. When he saw her come in, he smiled towards her warmly. "Did things go smoothly?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded. "It went perfectly."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Jun Xin came back and said to give these things to you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What things?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu pointed towards the bed. "They seem to be human skin masks."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Human skin masks?" Tang Doudou walked towards the bed curiously and saw that there were two human skin masks on the bed. She picked them up with furrowed brows. "Could it be that he wants us to wear these?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's not right. With Gu Xun keeping such a tight watch on us, we wouldn't be able to leave even with our faces disguised."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's put them away for now. Since he gave them to us, they'll definitely come into use." Baili Yu helped Tang Doudou come to a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou nodded and placed the masks inside the box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This was what you went out to get?" When Baili Yu saw the contents of the box, his expression changed. He had a feeling that these things had something to do with him. They seemed to be things that he had been searching for for a very long time, they were very important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, this is for curing the Hoarfrost Poison in your body. It's just a shame that you've lost your memories, otherwise you'd know how to use them." Tang Doudou sighed, then swiftly put the items away again before heading downstairs with Baili Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xun was already downstairs waiting. When he saw them, he called Jin Yi over to lead them to the secret passage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They went with the earlier plan. Gu Xun's subordinates would lead them through the secret passage to meet up with the people outside, then they'd quietly leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The subordinate that Gu Xun sent was Jin Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alliance Head Li, please come with me." When they got to the secret passageway, Jin Yi walked inside with only a small oil lamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou and Baili Yu shared a glance. Just as they stepped inside, Tang Doudou felt a bout of dizziness and her stomach churned, so she leaned against the wall and retched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Doudou? What's wrong?" Tang Doudou's abnormal condition gave Baili Yu a fright. He hastily walked over to support her and rub her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't know what was going on either. She thought it was probably due to something she ate while she had been out with Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style>, so she waved and said, "I'm fine, let's go."</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jin Yi's brows furrowed. Tang Doudou's current condition, why did it seem to be like...</span></p>
