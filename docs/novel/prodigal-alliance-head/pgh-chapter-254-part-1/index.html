 <p><b>Chapter 254.1: Once Again Encountering Mu Ye</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was someone of the Seven Great Saint Tribes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That black robe had seriously made too deep of an impression on her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn't expected to encounter someone of the Seven Great Saint Tribes the moment she got to Cerulean Mountain. From the looks of it, her earlier guess hadn't been wrong. Baili Yu had definitely left due to discovering some black-clothed men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou edged backwards nervously. The monkey on her back also seemed to be very nervous. It grabbed her hair tightly as it cried out softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-clothed man wasn't far from them. He was near the underbrush where the monkey was and was only a few steps away from her. If he wanted, he could instantly get to her, grab her throat, and snap it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou's thoughts got to this point, she couldn't help but take another step back. However, she was also worried about causing too large of a disturbance and attracting the black-clothed man's attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only features of the black-clothed man that could be seen were his eyes. They were clear like a cool stream, and made him look much more appealing than Shen Moru, who was like a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, she didn't sense any hints of danger from this black-clothed man. His imposing aura was restrained and not a single hint of it was let out. His gaze was also mild as he looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was thinking that perhaps this person didn't know who she was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, though her name was famous, there were very few people that actually knew what she looked like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, right when she had this thought, she saw a hint of probing flash through that black-clothed man's eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, he laughed softly. It was like the sound of an inadvertently plucked guqin string, clear and slightly magnetic. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's breath was taken away by that sound. She couldn't help but sigh from the bottom of her heart. Wasn't this sound a little too beautiful!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This is Cerulean Mountain's forbidden grounds. Why did Lady run in here?" The black-clothed man slowly walked over. His eyes swept over the monkey behind her. "A nine-eared Monkey? Is it your pet?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uh..." Tang Doudou knitted her brows. The forbidden grounds of Cerulean Mountain probably pointed to the forbidden grounds of the Seven Great Saint Tribes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lil' Gray is my..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually people would be killed for breaking into forbidden grounds, but this black-clothed person actually started chatting with her. Wasn't this a little too strange?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Baili Yu had mentioned before that not everyone in the Seven Great Saint Tribes was a bad person. There was for example, Jun Xin. He only joined the Saint Tribes and became a Saint Envoy for the sake of finding information on his parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there was Nan Maner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it weren't for her, she and Mu Ye wouldn't have been able to escape Tree Valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, was this person a good person, or a bad person?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lady truly has good fortune. This Nine-eared Monkey is a very rare spirit beast." The black-clothed person's tone was light and gentle. It was very hard for someone to feel malice towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why did Lady come to this forbidden grounds?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's eyes whirled slightly, then she pulled the monkey behind her up to the front. The monkey seemed to be very afraid of this black-clothed person and hastily burrowed into Tang Doudou's chest. It only stopped moving once its head was completely hidden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I didn't come in here on purpose. It was all Lil' Gray's fault. He ran in looking for food. I was worried that he'd encounter something dangerous so I ran in after him!" Tang Doudou acted as if she had just come to her senses and explained herself timidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-clothed man laughed again. "So it was like hat."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If I ended up bothering you, I-I'll leave right away!" Tang Doudou turned to leave with the little monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her heart was practically about to leap out of her throat. She was really worried that this black-clothed man would suddenly attack her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he just offered considerately, "The forest isn't safe. Why don't I see you out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, how could Tang Doudou dare to accept? She hastily evaded the offer. "No need! I can get out by myself!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-clothed person didn't try to convince her and simply asked, "Lady knows the way out?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she didn't, in this kind of situation, of course she had to say that she did!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was certain that she would rather wander around the forest blindly by herself than travel with someone from the Seven Great Saint Tribes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even if you do know the way, are you not worried about encountering other people? Their temper isn't as good as mine, you know." That person walked closer. "Lady should just allow this one to see you out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just brought up a big truth. If she blindly strolled around this forest, she'd definitely encounter other black-clothed men and would likely be killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why wasn't this person trying to kill her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And why was he being so nice as to help her find her way out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was odd!</span><span style>"There are other people? Isn't this forbidden grounds?" Tang Doudou looked at him with a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-clothed man nodded slightly but still said the same thing. "Let's go, I'll see you out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knew that she couldn't refuse the offer anymore. If she refused again, it'd attract his suspicions, so she nodded. "Then I'll have to trouble you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the monkey heard that Tang Doudou had agreed, it immediately started struggling in her arms. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou tried to comfort it, but it struggled out of her grasp and jumped onto a tree. Baring its teeth, it screeched at the black-clothed man for a while, then leapt into the leaves and disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou wanted to chase after it but the black-clothed man grabbed her arm. "The spirit monkey is smart, nothing will happen to it. There are a lot of spirit fruits that help with cultivation in this forbidden grounds so that's probably what it came here for. Lady doesn't need to worry. It'll head back by itself once it eats its fill."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course she knew that it would be fine on its own. It's just that she felt safer with the monkey here. Now she had to faced this black-clothed person on her own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lil' Gray is just a naughty glutton of a monkey. How could it know anything about cultivating?" As expected, the Seven Great Saint Tribes really had something to do with cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As of now, only spirit animals are capable of cultivating. Its desire to eat is also instinct and its resulting increase in cultivation is simply the Will of Heaven." The black-clothed person said in explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Tang Doudou continued to act as if she couldn't understand anything as she inwardly cursed the monkey. When she saw that the black-clothed person had started walking, she had no choice but to follow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If the spirit monkey doesn't come back for a long time, Lady can go to Dual Moon Palace to look for me," said the black-clothed man after they walked for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dual Moon Palace?"</span><span style>"En. You can just ask someone for directions. At that time, I'll help Lady look for the spirit monkey in the forbidden grounds."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was actually being this cordial?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-clothed man then said, "If you encounter any trouble, you can also go there to look for me. My name's Lan Jia."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jia? Tang Doudou silently repeated it a couple times. It seemed familiar, but she couldn't recall where she had heard it before, so she just nodded, "Thanks."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not at all."</span></p>
