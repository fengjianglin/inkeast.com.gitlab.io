 <p><b>Chapter 256.2: Saint City</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>"W-what happened? Is it already over?" Tang Doudou lifted her head and saw that they were already at an unfamiliar place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye nodded before setting her down on a nearby rock. He then proceeded to cut open his sleeve and retrieve some medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily snatched the medicine from him. "I'll apply it for you. It'll be hard for you to do it with only one hand."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought that Mu Ye would refuse her help, but he simply turned his head to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was stunned for a moment, but she soon came to her senses and pulled of the bottle cork. After pouring the medicinal powder evenly on the injury, she ripped a piece of &nbsp;cloth from the hem of her garments and bandaged his wound before asking, "The Disseminating Tassel Fragrance in your body..."</span><span style>"It's fused." Mu Ye turned his head slightly as a trace of firmness flashed through his cold eyes. "They now have one more target."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou who was cleaning up the bloody scraps of cloth on the ground froze for a moment when she heard this. She didn't dare to think deeply about the meaning contained in those words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, Mu Ye didn't continue this topic since he wasn't a talkative person from the start. After resting for a while, he started urging Tang Doudou to move again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was injured, Tang Doudou refused to allow him to carry her anymore. She used qinggong and slowly flew forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was slow, it was still faster than walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of their journey was calm and eventless. After half a day, the two arrived to the gate of Saint City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They stole two black robes and tablets, and then snuck into the city with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The inside of the city was actually not much different from regular city streets. Both sides of the street were filled with vendors and pedestrians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only difference was that everyone here concealed their faces and figures. It was possible to still distinguish the genders of some, but many &nbsp;were completely concealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't help but silently remark that there were definitely a lot of swindlers here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Ye had warned her before they entered the city that she should try to avoid speaking as much as possible. He even stuffed Lil' Gray into her black robe so that he stayed on her back, making her look like a hunchback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was fine with it since it helped to conceal her identity. After all, who would have imagined that she would pretend to be a hunchback?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the city, Mu Ye found an inn and booked two rooms. He then instructed Tang Doudou to head in and rest before leaving by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown what he headed off to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the room, Tang Doudou put Lil' Gray down, then took off the black robe before lying down comfortably on the bed. She had only lay down for a while when a knocking came from the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear guest, the food you ordered has arrived!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>So it was a waiter. But, when did she order food?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as she wondered, she pulled the black robe back on until only her eyes were exposed. She stuffed the unwilling monkey back on her back before slowly walking over to open the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter was also dressed in a black robe that covered him from head to toe and only left his fawning eyes uncovered. He immediately carried the food in when she opened the door. "The guest that left just now ordered these for you. Please take your time and enjoy. Do let us know if you need anything else!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thanks." Tang Doudou squeezed her throat and spoke in a slightly hoarse voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter hastily repeated that it wasn’t much and withdrew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou stayed by the door the entire time and only moved to close the door once the waiter left. However, right at this time, she saw a group of black-clothed people enter the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man and a woman led the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou recognized them by their eyes with one glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weren’t they Nangong Yan and Murong Ming?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't keep watching because her first glance already attracted Murong Ming's attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn't panic either. She simply shifted her gaze away and walked into the room, closing the door behind her. She then stayed by the door to listen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you looking at?" It was Nangong Yan's voice. When Baili Yu wasn't present, her tone was always filled with arrogance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Nothing much. It just so happened that someone upstairs had glanced this way," replied Murong Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nangong Yan immediately became nervous. "Who was it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ming said, "It was just a coincidental look. It's not someone we know."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's good!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shopkeeper, give us three high quality rooms!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear guest, I apologize but there are only two high quality rooms left," replied the shopkeeper with an apologetic smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This group of people gave off an aggressive air. The shopkeeper could tell with a single glance that it wouldn't be good to provoke them, so he could only humble himself to try to keep them happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? With how crappy your store is, how could it be full? You sure have guts as to try and lie to us!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shopkeeper replied with something, but Tang Doudou had lost interest in listening. She returned to the table and glanced at the abundance of dishes. Pretty much every plate had meat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of a smile flashed through her bright eyes. It seemed that Mu Ye had noticed her craving for meat. She picked up the chopsticks and was just about to start eating when Lil' Gray twitched on her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Tang Doudou remember that he was there and took him off her back. "Lil' Gray? Do you eat meat?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil' Gray shook his head firmly, but when he saw the dishes on the table, he immediately clutched his chest like his heart was breaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou burst out laughing. She then picked out some vegetables and placed it in front of him. "If you don't eat meat, just have some vegetables!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil' Gray immediately bounced up and down. After bowing towards her, he lowered his head to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he suddenly screeched. Tang Doudou was alarmed and hastily covered his mouth. When she saw that the screech hadn't attracted any trouble, she lowered her eyes and lifted Lil' Gray. "Why are you screaming all of a sudden?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil' Gray pointed at the dishes on the table, and then clutched his neck abruptly.</span></p>
