 <p><b>Chapter 322.1: The Owner</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Qing Cheng hastily rushed out with the courtesan. The crowd was going crazy outside. A lot of guests had already stormed out. The remaining ones were either fuming with rage or watching the show with amusement. The only one who seemed completely unpreturbed was Tang Longbiao, who was sitting there with one leg crossed while sampling tea. Lian </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> who was kneeling next to him was flushed with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Two hundred thousand and one taels!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>That idiot was still adding!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng quietly cursed, then walked to the stage. "Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Please calm down and allow Qing Cheng a word."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What else is there to say? You guys are sure shameless, to put on this show just to inflate the price!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Exactly! This is two much! Can these two youngsters even take out that much money?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And just for a little prostitute too. Do you really take us for fools!?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng's face turned pale as he glanced towards Lin Shuxuan's private room. Could it be that the owner really was in there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Gentlemen, this really had nothing to do with our Wind Cherishing House. If you don't believe me, we can invite Young Master Lin and this Tang </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> out and hear the truth from their mouths."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who knows if you guys aren't all working together?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Exactly! Exactly!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What if you guys had arranged all of this beforehand? Then no matter what they say, it's still be just a ruse."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng felt a headache. "Then what must we do to prove that it's not a trick?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If they really take out that much money, I'll believe it. If they can't take it out, that means you guys are working together!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This..." Qing Cheng hesitated and subconsciously glanced at Tang Doudou. Could she take out that much money?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn't worried about his owner being troubled with this much money, but if Tang Doudou couldn't take out that much money, then they wouldn't be able to shake off this accusation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What a joke! Are you guys worried that Brother Tang can't bring out that much money?" Just as Qing Cheng was at a complete loss, Lin Shuxuan spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Master Lin, forgive this old man for being rude, but although you are the heir of the Lin Clan Stronghold, you're not wealthy to that extent. That's two hundred thousand taels! Not even the Lin Clan Stronghold could take out that sum all at once!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Shuxuan said, "It's true, I don't have that much money."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hall instantly filled with clamor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one expected for Lin Shuxuan to admit it so quickly. Even more people became infuriated and some even shouted for Wind Cherishing House to get the hell out of Hibiscus Garrison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou didn't speak. For some reason, she felt that Lin Shuxuan was doing this on purpose for the sake of achieving a certain goal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was starting to hurl a lot of angry complaints and insults now. Qing Cheng was about to cry from panic. He had no idea what his boss was trying to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lin Shuxuan didn't seem to hear any of the crowd and just continued, "I had no intentions of fighting with Brother Tang over Escort Xue. I just wanted to accompany Brother Tang in this game a little."</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did this mean?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou suddenly became uneasy. She looked towards the stage at Baili Yu. She wanted to steer the conversation to a safer direction before Lin Shuxuan could continue, but she didn't know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu's gaze also darkened. Although he felt that something was off, he had lost his memories and didn't have enough information to accurately judge the situation, so he could only watch silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since everyone seems object to it so much, I won't add to the price anymore. Brother Tang, I'll yield Escort Xue to you. I was just joking with Brother Tang earlier, I hope Brother Tang won't take it to heart?" said Lin Shuxuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's eyes narrowed. "Brother Lin's joke was a little too much."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, two hundred thousand taels is just a drop in the ocean to Brother Tang."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her chin and said with a laugh, "Actually, you know, I was just joking with Brother Lin as well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words immediately caused Wind Cherishing House to fall deathly silent again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Humph! What kind of joke are you guys trying to pull? In my opinion, this is completely Wind Cherishing House's doing!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng smiled wryly. "It really has nothing to do with us!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You guys don't trust Wind Cherishing House, but could it be that you guys don't trust me?" Lin Shuxuan continued, "This doesn't have anything to do with Wind Cherishing House."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What exactly is going on? Young Master Lin, you should at least give us an explanation!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's there to explain?" said Lin Shuxuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We all came for Escort Xue, but due to you guys..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En, then do any of you have two hundred thousand taels?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person speaking fell silent awkwardly. Even if he did have that much, he wouldn't spend it on a courtesan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since you don't, what are you still quibbling about?" Lin Shuxuan then said to Qing Cheng, "Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, isn't it about time to announce the result? Or is it that you're still waiting for someone to increase the price?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it occurred to Qing Cheng that Lin Shuxuan's words may be the owner's instructions, he said, "Ahem, I'll announce it right now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Humph! I'd like what other trick you guys can pull now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng cleared his throat, but didn't know what to say. This disturbance had unnerved him so much that his mind was completely blink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was actually Lin Shuxuan who spoke to help him out. "Congratulations, Brother Tang, in successfully obtaining a beauty. It's truly worthy of celebration!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou knew that he definitely had more to say. As she had expected, he continued, "The spring nights are bitterly short, shouldn't Brother Tang hurry and take the beauty off to enjoy the night? It's impressive that you're still able to hold yourself back even now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, the bid hasn't even been paid yet! Aren't you worried that this guy will eat the meal, then run off?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What nonsense are you saying!? Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style>, don't worry, Brother Tang will definitely pay every tael. You guys, hurry up and go dress Escort Xue up for my Brother Tang."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing </span><i><span style>gongzi</span></i><span style> forced a laugh. "Understood, right away!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said that, he looked towards Tang Longbiao. When he saw that Tang Longbiao was still sitting there unperturbed, he became nervous again. If his memory wasn't wrong, Tang Longbiao had also said that he was just joking with Lin Shuxuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the owner wasn't in Lin Shuxuan's private room earlier and he sent Escort Xue to Tang Longbiao, then Tang Longbiao revealed that he didn't have that much money, how was he supposed to deal with things then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The courtesan he sent to check Lin Shuxuan's room hadn't returned either, so should he trust Jin Yi's words or not?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Cheng expressed that he felt about to go crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this time, Baili Yu, who had been standing next to him, moved.</span></p>
