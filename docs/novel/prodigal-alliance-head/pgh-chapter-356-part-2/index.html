 <p><b>Chapter 356.2: Baili Yu's Family</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling was also taken aback for a moment. However, when she got a clear look at this person, she greeted him sweetly, "Ninth Uncle! Why didn't you say anything? You almost scared us to death!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninth Uncle?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had question marks in both eyes. This person was clearly Shen Moru, how had he become Baili Yiling's Ninth Uncle?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling seemed to sense her confusion, because she then introduced them. "Sister-in-Law, don't be scared. Ninth Uncle isn't Shen Moru, they only look a little alike. However, it's not strange because they're related, right, Ninth Uncle?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"En." The man being addressed as Ninth Uncle replied softly before turning to look at Tang Doudou. "This is your big brother's wife?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right! Ninth Uncle, don't you think that Big Brother's taste is really good? Isn't my sister-in-law a beauty capable of toppling a city and making the moon feel ashamed?"</span><span style>"She's a good match for your big brother," replied Ninth Uncle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling's smile immediately widened even more. She pulled Tang Doudou and said excitedly, "Sister-in-Law, Ninth Uncle just praised you! Hurry and call him Ninth Uncle!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fudge, a wife had to meet her in-laws sooner or later, but she had never heard of a sister-in-law being the one to introduce the in-laws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She silently complained. Fudge, Yiling should have warned her! If she had known that they were here to see Baili Yu's relatives, she would've changed before heading over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law." When Baili Yiling saw that Tang Doudou was spacing out, she tugged on Tang Doudou's clothes and quietly prompted her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou came back to her senses. Just as she was about to greet the man, that Ninth Uncle turned and walked forward. "Let's go, the tribesmen are waiting for you two."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he walked a bit further away, Tang Doudou lowered her voice and asked, "Why does it feel like your ninth uncle is a little weird?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He's always been like this, don't mind it."</span><span style>"When did he arrive earlier? Did he hear what we said about your brother losing his memories? Yiling, I can't help but feel uneasy." She pressed on her chest. She didn't know if it was the location or the fact that Ninth Uncle looked so much like Shen Moru, but she felt very uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling was walking ahead of Tang Doudou so she didn't notice Tang Doudou's abnormality. She walked for quite a while before she realized that there were no footsteps coming from behind her and turned around to check. When she saw that there was no trace of Tang Doudou, she immediately became flustered. "Sister-in-Law!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sister-in-Law!" Baili Yiling's face turned pale. This sinkhole wasn't some place to play in. Just a single wrong step could claim one's life because this place was filled with traps that the tribesmen had set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling didn't dare to run around to look on her own either. She gritted her teeth. The best choice right now was to find Ninth Uncle and the rest so that they could help her look. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hopefully they'd make it in time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after she left, Tang Doudou climbed out of the underbrush dizzily. She rubbed her pulsing temples. Why did she faint?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she looked around, she saw that Baili Yiling was nowhere in sight. That girl couldn't have left her here, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fudge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason she fainted was probably because this place was too strange. It was definitely due to radiation. However, why did it seem like Baili Yiling and the other tribesmen weren't affected at all? This wouldn't do, she had to hurry and find Yiling, then leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was about to start walking, she realized that someone was in front of her. She stopped and looked towards person walking to her with a confused frown. "Ninth Uncle?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You have no right to call me that way."</span><span style>Ninth Uncle's tone was still mild like before, but it contained faint hostility. Tang Doudou found it strange. Why was he hostile towards her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ninth Uncle, this seems to be the first time that we've met? Nothing has happened between us before, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninth Uncle's expression turned dark and he snarled, "Scram!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't help but become pissed off when he was hostile for no reason. "You think I want to come here? If it wasn't Yiling that brought me here, who would come to this damned gloomy hole? It's not fit for humans at all!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fudge! If a pregnant woman stayed here for long, it would probably affect their unborn child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What exactly was the Baili family thinking, to pick some place like this for seclusion?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weren't they worried at all about their descendants dying out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, although Baili Yiling seemed very friendly with them, when Baili Yu talked about being responsible for these people, his expression was filled with pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This tribe that hid themselves from the world like turtles put the burden of their lives on the shoulders of one small child, yet they were acting like it was natural to do so!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wretch! You dared to yell at me?" Ninth Uncle's eyes turned red from anger when he heard Tang Doudou complaining about this place being unfit for humans. He rushed up and seized her by the throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If it wasn't for you, why would Yu </span><i><span style>er</span></i><span style> meet with a mishap? It's all because of you! I'll kill you!" Ninth Uncle looked insane. The veins on his forehead and the back of his hands were bulging out unnaturally. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hadn't expected for him to suddenly rush up. By the time she managed to react, there was already an echoing hum in her head due to lack of air. She tried to push him away, but her shoves were as useless as if she was hitting an iron wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that she was going to die here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After surviving so many dangerous situations, she was actually going to die at the entrance of Baili Yu's home?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How ironic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was probably the only one in the world who would think about these things at death's door. Anyone else would be focused on fighting for their life right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'll kill you! I'll kill you!" Ninth Uncle's voice reverberated in the spacious sinkhole and bounced back like someone was answering. "I'll kill you, kill you…"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, a flustered fearful expression appeared on his face and he hastily released her and retreated backwards while looking around in alarm. His originally oppressive aura instantly disappeared. As the echos of 'I'll kill you' continued, he laced his hands together and started shaking his hands in a begging manner. "It's not me, it's not me! Don't kill me, don't kill me! It really wasn't me…"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cough cough cough…</span></i><span style> Tang Doudou pressed on her throat as she gasped for breath. She looked towards Ninth Uncle. His current condition, did he go insane?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or was it that he had long already gone insane due to living here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Radioactivity tended to affect the brain after all. Tang Doudou got up while leaning against the tree trunk behind her. Even without a mirror, she knew that five clear bruises were definitely forming on her neck. Ninth Uncle had been serious about killing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't stay here! She had to get away now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was thinking this, she kept an eye on Ninth Uncle's movements and slowly backed away. However, after a few steps, she recalled Baili Yiling. She didn't know how these people thought of Baili Yiling. Although Baili Yiling had greeted Ninth Uncle very enthusiastically earlier, this Ninth Uncle hadn't shown much reaction. What if they took things out on Baili Yiling once she left?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, Baili Yiling also wasn't a true member of the Saint Tribes… </span><i><span style>pei pei</span></i><span style>! What as she thinking? Baili Yiling's brain worked much better than hers! She'd definitely be able to find her way out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rubbed her head, then shook it to try to clear the dizziness. She had to hurry and get away from this Ninth Uncle. Once Baili Yiling realized that she was gone, she'd definitely come back to look for her. It wouldn't be too late to tell Baili Yiling about these things then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop right there! You can't escape!" As soon as she started to move, Ninth Uncle's demon-like voice appeared from behind her. Before she could even react, his hand had already landed on her shoulder.</span></p>
