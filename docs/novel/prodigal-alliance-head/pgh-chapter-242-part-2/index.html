 <p><b>Chapter 242.2: Spider Web</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything was already ready by the time she got there. They were just waiting for her to come before departing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This time Tang Doudou didn’t sit in a carriage all by herself. Instead, she shared one with Baili Yu that was driven by Feng Long. At the other carriage, Jun Xin was complaining incessantly as Bai Lianhua awkwardly got on, followed by Yuner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner</span> <span style>been with the group all along but Tang Doudou was a little scared of him after that last incident. It was just like encountering the Seven Great Saint Tribes, his strange abilities made one’s heart fill with dread. Thus, she didn’t dare to approach Yuner much anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so much so that she even forgot to tell him that she encountered San Yu in Cloud City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner</span> <span style>seemed to have sensed her gaze as he said a few words to Jun Xin before coming over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked at Baili Yu, but he just smiled at her before closing his eyes, so she jumped off the carriage and stood in front of Yuner</span> <span style>awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner’s eyes were as bright and clear as before. However, he didn’t give off that foolish feeling anymore, nor did he have that submissive yes-man attitude from before. Now, he just seemed like a youngster with a gentle and elegant temperament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Tang Doudou with an apologetic expression on his good-looking face. “Beautiful Big Sister, I’m sorry about that last incident, Yuner</span> <span style>wasn't deliberately trying to frighten Beautiful Big Sister. The situation was just so urgent. If I didn’t make Big Sister lose consciousness, then the poison would have spread through your entire body. If that happened, the situation would have gotten even worse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Xin already explained this to her after the incident, so Tang Doudou didn’t take it to heart. Now that this was brought up, she answered honestly, “I don’t blame you. I already know about the situation so don’t worry about it.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner</span> <span style>still looked apologetic. “I wanted to come over and apologize to Big Sister, but hadn't had a chance to. Back then, I ended up using more energy than my body could handle and injured myself. This matter only got delayed for so long because I had to spend the last few days treating my injury..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s your injury now?” After a few words, Tang Doudou feeling of discomfort towards Yuner</span> <span style>had disappeared. Yuner was still the same Yuner. The only difference was that he was no longer so foolish and that should count as &nbsp;a good thing! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuner</span> <span style>replied, “I’m almost fully recovered. I wouldn’t be out otherwise.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, it's good that you've recovered. Oh, that’s right, there’s something else that I wanted to tell you. But, don’t get overly excited, alright? I’m not sure whether I’ve recognized the right person or not either,” said Tang Doudou. Then she proceeded to tell him everything about her encounter with San Yu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“She told me that I was mistaken. I don’t think I was but she kept acting like she didn't know me so there was nothing I could do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Tang Doudou was speaking, she peeked to check Yuner’s expression. Surprisingly, his face didn’t contain any anxiousness nor any excitement. Contrary to expectations, he seemed very calm. “San Yu probably didn’t want us to know about this matter.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>San Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not Big Sister San Yu? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou looked at Yuner in surprise. Could it be after becoming more intelligent, he didn’t feel that sort of attachment to San Yu anymore? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why he didn’t feel anything even when San Yu’s matter was brought up? </span></p>
 <p><span style>If that was the case, it'd really be sad! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beautiful Big Sister, if there’s nothing else, then I’ll return to the carriage now. For the next few days, Big Sister must remember to not lean your head on the left side.” After saying that, he turned around and walked back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Doudou watched him walk away, she rubbed the left side of her head. How come it felt like Yuner</span> <span style>was becoming more and more like a fake Daoist priest? </span></p>
 <p><span style>He said to not lean her head to the left side. Could it be that her neck would hurt if she did? </span></p>
 <p><span style>She shrugged and climbed into the carriage without taking the warning seriously.</span></p>
