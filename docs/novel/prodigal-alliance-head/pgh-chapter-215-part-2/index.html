 <p><b>Chapter 215.2: Only Opens Unrestrictedly For You</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fine. She was clearly overthinking things, because the interior of the room was very normal. As always, Baili Yu was laying on a couch. His distinctive languid aura could be felt through the screen even before his figure was seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da fudge? He even put up a screen this time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou saw that Nangong Yan was behaving herself and sitting on a chair away from the screen and drinking tea, she loosened a breath in relief and walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn't know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu didn't speak either and the atmosphere immediately turned stiff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn't continue for too long though. Nangong Yan gave a tender laugh, then said to Baili Yu, "Senior Brother, since Sister-in-Law is here as well, why don't we just go together?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu still didn't make a sound. Tang Doudou who was standing in the room felt abnormally awkward. When Nangong Yan called her 'sister-in-law,' she felt goosebumps rise up so much that they fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when she thought that Baili Yu would pay no attention to Nangong Yan, he spoke. As always, it was languid. As always, no emotions could be made out. "En."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually agreed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou immediately felt countless grass mud horses run through her heart. Depressed wasn't enough to describe what she felt!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really wanted to just turn and walk away. However, when she saw delight appear on Nangong Yan's face and the provocative look she sent over, her legs refused to move. It was as if they had established roots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Perfect. I wanted to take a walk around as well." She shot a look back at Nangong Yan. It was cold and filled with disdain. Hell, as long as martial arts wasn't involved, it was easy as pie to deal with a little brat like Nangong Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she finished speaking, she lifted her chin and walked towards the screens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Big evil spirit.." She pinched her throat to call out in a voice that was so sticky and sweet it was almost unbearable to hear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, she walked through the screens. "It's been so long since we've seen each other, did you miss... me- ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she even finished speaking, she was immediately hit with regret upon seeing the scene behind the screen. She really, really regretted it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu who was behind the screen also froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But soon his dark red lips curved up. He stopped handling the clothing and slowly lowered his jade-like fingers. The originally already covered scene was instantly revealed in full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wife, what do you think? Do you think I missed you?" His tone was very deep and low, just loud enough for her to hear it clearly. It was unknown if Nangong Yan who was outside could hear it or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou gulped. She felt like right now, she should apply 'of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, fleeing is the best measure.' Never did it occur to her that Baili Yu was actually changing behind the screens. Fudge. No wonder. He never used screens before...</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Nangong Yan walked in earlier...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wife, don't worry. This husband's chest only opens unrestrictedly for Wife."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou had already witnessed his skill at teasing, but she didn't have much immunity towards it anymore. When she saw his firm, jade-like chest, she recalled the way she had bit him back then... Ahem. It didn't occur to her at that time, but when she thought about it now, it was a really erotic move...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something was off. Although Baili Yu was usually licentious- Pei! It's 'usually seductive,' but he had quite severe mysophobia. How could he possibly be changing right here, right now, with just a screen set up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, Nangong Yan was even outside. When Tang Doudou's thoughts reached this point, she became unhappy again. If she didn't come and only Nangong Yan came in. If this screen wasn't here. If...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as possibilities were running through her heart, she suddenly saw something that didn't quite fit in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou rushed over. Before Baili Yu could react, she pulled the thing out. It was a bloody bandage. Her expression immediately filled with worry. "What is this? You!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she could finish speaking, a certain person had pulled her into his arms and covered her mouth gently yet also tyrannically. After greedily drinking in the feeling for a little while, he finally let go reluctantly. His hoarse voice sounded next to her ear. "Don't disclose it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou's heart tightened. "How did you get injured?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't he still fine yesterday at the martial arts matchmaking competition?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu had missed this girl a lot. God knows how he had managed to suppress those urges to go look for her during this time. When he saw her come in and only ask about irrelevant things, he really wanted to thoroughly punish her. However, when he recalled that Nangong Yan was outside, he couldn't help but become depressed. If it weren't for the fact that he had been too focused on treating his injury and didn't pay attention to what was happening outside, how could he have missed the fact that Tang Doudou had come?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he hadn't expected her to come so fast. He thought that Su Yi would, at the very least, keep her in the City Lord Residence until most of those people had left before allowing her out.</span></p>
