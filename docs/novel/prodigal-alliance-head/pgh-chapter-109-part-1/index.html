 <p><b>Chapter 109.1: Have to Leave Again</b><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are on volare. If this is being found anywhere else, it has been stolen. Don't support theft. :)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You truly cannot differentiate between good and bad. This old man’s leaving!” Cang Baicao tugged off the mask on his face, revealing the obnoxious face of that old beggar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou curled her lips in disdain. “Do as you please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You better not regret it. This guy will definitely die in less than an hour!” said Cang Baicao with a humph.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Tang Doudou kept her spine straight and firm and refused to ask him to stay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She finally had it figured out. There was no way this old guy would leave. He was just trying to gain some benefits by having her ask him for help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she refused to be fooled. If he has the guts, he should just leave!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao dawdled some more. “</span><i><span style>Yatou</span></i><span style>, I’m really leaving now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you leaving or not? If you’re not leaving, this </span><i><span style>xiao ye</span></i><span style> will help give you a push!” Tang Doudou cracked her knuckles as she walked towards Cang Baicao with a nasty grin on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stinkin’ </span><i><span style>yatou</span></i><span style>, are you really not afraid of death? I-I’m telling you! You better act more respectfully towards me. Otherwise I won’t help save Baili Yu and you will die too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die? This </span><i><span style>xiao ye</span></i><span style>, I, am not afraid of dying! At worst let’s just all die together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sent a kick towards Cang Baicao then viciously gave the old guy a beating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did the old man start to behave. In a delicate and tender manner, he sobbed spasmodically on the ground. His back faced Tang Doudou and his shoulder shook from his sobs. “Heartless stinkin’ </span><i><span style>yatou</span></i><span style>, do you know how many times this old man has cured you from poison? How many times this old man has treated your wounds? And you’re treating your life’s savior this way!? It’s too much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quit blabbering and save the person. Otherwise, trust me when I say I’ll beat you to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was this old and yet still not acting in a decent manner. He should be beat up more to shake out his bones and loosen his skin. Only with this would it prevent him from becoming a dotard!<span style="color: #3366ff"> (</span></span><span style><span style="color: #3366ff">an old person, especially one who has become weak or senile)</span>&nbsp;<sup>T/N</sup> </span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao sulked and kept muttering complaints for a while before starting to treat Baili Yu’s injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s more like it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that Cang Baicao was lending a hand, Baili Yu’s little life could be counted as saved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, old man, why do you think those people appeared at Azure Water Valley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Obviously to kill Baili Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If they wanted to kill Baili Yu, couldn’t they have done it anywhere they wanted? Why would they need to go to Azure Water Valley to kill him? Not to mention, isn’t Cloud City super strong? Isn’t God Firmament Hall worried that Cloud City will seek them out to get revenge for Azure Water Valley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much Tang Doudou thought about it, she couldn’t figure it out. And what did Mu Ye go to Azure Water Valley for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao sighed. “The current Cloud City can’t compare to the Cloud City of the past. These past years, the City Lord has been ignoring the city’s affairs and would often wander around outside. Those people in the city have been restless for a long time. Then, on top of that, you met with an accident…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does that have to do with me?” Tang Doudou looked towards Cang Baicao gloomily. No wonder Elder Yu behaved so boldly and tried to snatch the position of Alliance Head away from her. It turned out that it was because her backing was on the verge of collapsing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does it have to do with you? You’re asking what does it have to do with you? You should know that the person most likely to be the next city lord is you! Ever since you were a child, the City Lord has treated you like his own biological daughter. Regardless of what bad things you did in the Jianghu, even if you set fire to the Imperial Palace, the City Lord would help clean up after your mess,” said Cang Baicao with a heartfelt sigh. “However, the City Lord hasn’t returned to the City ever since you got poisoned. He has been rushing here and there nonstop in order to help you search for an antidote. He even thought of ways to block the assassins that were after you and warned you against being snatched away by someone after losing your memories…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, wait!” When Cang Baicao got to this part, Tang Doudou hastily made a time-out gesture. “You said he helped block the assassins that were after me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Da f*ck? That’s saying blind things with your eyes wide open ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The real Li Xueyi had already dropped dead. Right now she was just an impostor draping on someone else’s skin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem. The City Lord is a man, not a god. It’s inevitable for mistakes to happen. You should be content with your situation…” Cang Baicao gave a dry cough, then said, “I’ve already finished treating his wound. I’ll leave these medicine here. For the first three days, remember to help him change the medicine once a day. After that, change his medicine once every three days. Once the scab forms, you can just use normal injury medicine. As for the Hoarfrost Poison inside his body, this contains the instructions and tools for curing the poison. After you look through it, you can slowly help him with it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he handed her a small wooden box. Then, he warned, “No matter what, don’t let any other people see this, especially Baili Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is a man, not a god.’ He said it as if it was really logical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, who cares. Li Xueyi was already dead. Right now she was Tang Doudou. Ever since she had been reborn, it had been Baili Yu and Bai Feiyun who had looked after her. That City Lord hadn’t even shown his face so who cares about how he’s doing!</span><span style>Tang Doudou accepted the box. Then, she looked at him with a doubtful expression, “Will I be able to do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course you can, you have to trust yourself!” Cang Baicao patted Tang Doudou’s shoulder as he said the words in a heartfelt and sincere tone. However, his eyes were filled with the mirth of schadenfreude. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was pondering about what the wooden box contained and didn’t notice Cang Baicao’s abnormal expression. “Alright, then I’ll help him with curing the poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She’ll help him cure his poison. Could this be used as a condition to exchange for other favors?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps she could use it to make him help cure her poison. Maybe she could even use it to make him cancel the wedding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Tang Doudou thought about it, the happier she got. Hell yeah, she could finally get a bit of an advantage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, this is pretty much all the business I had. I’m leaving first. You should take care!” As Cang Baicao spoke, he collected his stuff, then put that human skin mask back on. He headed towards the door, but suddenly turned back again. He stared at Tang Doudou and looked her up and down a couple times. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou hastily hugged her shoulders and protected her chest as she looked at him guardedly. This old thing couldn’t be a pervert, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you leaving? What did you come back for? You forgot something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Yatou</span></i><span style>, you took off that thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What thing?” Tang Doudou looked at Cang Baicao in confusion. Then she suddenly recalled and asked, “You’re talking about that thin thing? Yeah, I took it off. Is there a problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a huge problem!” Cang Baicao suddenly gave a long sigh. “You still do things without thinking about consequences.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Explain it more clearly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me ask you first: does Baili Yu know that you’re female?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou scratched her head. “He probably doesn’t?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu has never brought up the topic of whether she was male or female so how would she know if he knew?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention, to this day she still couldn’t bring herself to ask Baili Yu about what happened that night. That’s why this matter was really just unclear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably!? You actually don’t know about such an important matter!?” Cang Baicao’s expression was as if he hated the iron for not being steel. <span style="color: #3366ff">(feel resentment towards someone for failing to meet expectations)</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“If this is all you’re worried about, then no need to say anymore. You should hurry and go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it. In any case, I’ve also warned you. Whether you choose to listen or not is up to you! But before leaving, this old man still has to add one more sentence, even if it’s meddlesome. Baili Yu is not someone one can provoke!” After Cang Baicao said that, he turned around and opened the door. Then, he really left without turning back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time it was Tang Doudou’s turn to ponder. If it was only Cang Baicao that said this, it wouldn’t have really mattered but Su Yi had said this before too. What exactly about Baili Yu was so terrible? Why couldn’t he be provoked?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’s also a person. He likes to sleep, likes to smile like a fox, and likes to act profound. He could also be poisoned, injured, and die. But how come everyone describes him like he’s a demon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shouldn’t a real vicious demon be like Feng Yunhuan and that group of his?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou sat down next to Baili Yu and, for the first time, started thinking about everything seriously.</span></p>
