 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 409.1: Five Day's Time </strong></u></span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yiling recognized this thing. It was called rosemary and was a very strong knockout drug. By putting it inside the candle and slowly burning it, it'd cause a person to become drowsy without even realizing that they were under the effects of a drug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this was tasteless and colorless as it burned, there was just one fatal weakness to it that most people didn't know. Candles that had rosemary mixed in would burn slightly blue. The blue would be so faint that it was almost imperceptible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you weren't aware that rosemary was being used and didn't examine the flame specifically for that trace of blue, you wouldn't notice it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very difficult to obtain this drug. The only reason she knew of this drug was because she had already suffered at its hands before. Back then, she had only been saved because Grandpa Gui arrived just in time. After that incident, Grandpa Gui taught her about all the types of knockout drugs and their special traits. Since she had fallen for this drug before, she was especially sensitive to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that the master of the manor used this against her, or more precisely, used this in the guest rooms, meant that this manor was definitely hiding something!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Baili Yiling's thoughts got to this point, she became a little stirred up. She might really be able to find some important information here about the person that was behind all of this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Brother, just wait for my good news!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Azure Water Valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu had a jar of rice wine and was drinking cup after cup like it was water. His peach blossom eyes were even deeper than the color of the night. They were slightly narrowed, but also hazy. The cool moonlight seemed to freeze his crimson robe, causing the normally fiery color to look exceptionally cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another cup went down. He looked up at the bright moon. How was he supposed to choose?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Choosing to give up on his own child, how was that any different from killing his child with his own hands? How then, would he be any different from that insane father of his?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every night, he would dream of the past. Those vivid buried memories would always make him despair. That time, he had only been a few years old, but he had to watch as his brothers and sisters died one by one next to him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood, rotting flesh, and those disgusting bugs all over them… over him. That memory lingered in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even after so many years had passed, he still couldn't forget the terror that he had felt back then, the numb despair… Those people that died were sisters in which the same blood as his had flowed. Back then, he had wondered why the person they called father was so cruel, so heartless as to treat his own children this way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where were their mothers?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why didn't anyone come to save them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They wanted to live! That was the only desire in everyone's eyes, live… but gradually, even that faded. Their eyes turned dim and dull, then they died, until he was the only one left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he chose to allow the poison to spread in Tang Doudou's body, would that child have the same thought as he did back then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why were his parents so cruel?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A child that was near seven months old, if developing properly, would already be able to hear their parent's words and would kick his mother's stomach in joy… Did he already have a consciousness?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wouldn't death be too cruel to him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after coming to this world, before even having a chance to see it, he'd leave...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu abruptly grabbed the pot of wine and poured it into his mouth. He couldn't bring himself to think about what came next!</span></p>
 <p><span style><em>Crash!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style>After several swallows, he abruptly threw the pot to the ground and staggered towards Tang Doudou's room. Qing Yin saw him from a distance away and walked up to support him, but he pushed her away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu ignored her and pushed open the door. His eyes were completely red. "Senior Cang!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smell of alcohol filled the room. Cang Baicao was already on the brink of panicking because he had been inspecting the poison in Tang Doudou's body and could feel it slowly spreading. When he turned, he saw Baili Yu stagger over with complete despair in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You! Why did you drink so much!?" Cang Baicao's expression turned stern. How could he be in the mood to drink in this sort of time? Didn't he know that alcohol just intensified worries? It wasn't like Baili Yu was a normal person, how could he not understand this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao wouldn't understand. Even though Baili Yu wasn't an ordinary person, in front of his own wife, he was just a normal man that would feel pain and worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alcohol helped clear up his thoughts. It was just that he had never drunk it in the past because he had never felt that he needed his thoughts to be clearer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu grabbed Cang Baicao's hand. "Senior Cang, trust me, I'll definitely protect the child! I will!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're saying drunk words. I already told you clearly that this poison can't be cured! If you make a decision earlier, I can still help you protect this girl properly. After tomorrow, once the poison flares up, not only will the child be done for, this girl will also suffer huge damage. After all, this child is already quite big!" Cang Baicao spoke to Baili Yu sternly, "You had better think properly about what to do! Don't cause yourself a bigger loss due to hesitating over loss! At that time, this old man won't bother to care!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu said hoarsely with a bitter smile, "Doctors have the hearts of parents. Senior Cang, don't you find the child pitiful? He's completely innocent!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao's expression changed and he looked towards Baili Yu in surprise. It was only now that he felt there was something off with Baili Yu. "Baili Yu, you've drunk too much. Although this child is innocent, what's happened has already happened. As a doctor, if I can't save everyone, I have to save the patient with the highest chance of survival!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu didn't continue speaking. Even if he did, Senior Cang wouldn't understand. He wasn't willing to share with anyone those things that he had buried in the depths of his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled, then dropped to his knees in front of Cang Baicao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao jumped up in shock and looked at Baili Yu in confusion. "What do you mean by this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu's voice returned to its usual calm. He lifted his head and said slowly, "I know that you definitely have a way to suppress the poison. Give me three days. I'll bring the rootless grass back in three days."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wh-what did you say?" Cang Baicao's expression became filled with joy. "You can find the rootless grass?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Senior Cang, please help Doudou. Only three days, I only need three days!" Baili Yu didn't directly answer Cang Baicao's question and just lowered his head to kowtow towards Cang Baicao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Cang Baicao didn't allow him to kowtow. He truly couldn't take this honor. He hastily helped Baili Yu up. "I agree, get up first!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're right, I do have a way to suppress the poison. I've already fed her the vitals protection pill. It can protect her and the fetus for five days." After helping Baili Yu up, Cang Baicao took in his extremely haggard look and dim eyes, then shook his head. "However, if you don't come back in five days, I'll follow my original plan and force an abortion."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yu hadn't expected for him to have already fed Tang Doudou the vitals protection pill. If he had a way, why did he say that earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Baicao saw his confusion and sighed. "From the start, this fetus isn't normal. In my opinion, it can't be kept. However, both you and Tang Doudou were so adamant about keeping it, so it wasn't really the place of an outsider like me to say anything. That's why I left the valley. However, I never expected for something like this to happen after I left. Perhaps it's just Heaven's will!"</span></p>
