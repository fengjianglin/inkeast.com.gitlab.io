 <p><span style><u><strong>Chapter 392.1: I'll Definitely Kill You </strong></u></span></p>
 <p><span style>He was no longer that Xiao Bai who would smile gently every time he saw her and arrange everything for her so that she wouldn't worry. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps not even he himself was aware of his change. Or perhaps this was the true him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was the one that did these things and he was the one that changed his attitude towards her, so what did he mean by asking this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn't be that he thought she was the one that changed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou lowered her eyes and restrained all her complicated emotions. When she looked up again, there was a natural smile on her face. "Aren't you going to ask why I came to look for you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want to know who that person is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou shook her head. "I know who that person is, that's not what I want to ask."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Bai Feiyun chuckled and put down the book. "You know who that person is?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who else could it be besides Baili Yu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou curled her lips disdainfully. "There's no need to keep trying to arouse my interest. Don't we both know already?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun continued to smile as he lightly stroked the book. Then he opened it again to a certain page. His tone was distant as he said, "Then Alliance Head, please tell me why you're looking for me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn't he still alright just a moment ago? How had she ended up provoking him again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou couldn't figure out why Bai Feiyun's attitude was like this and swallowed her question back down. In the end, she asked, "Do you blame me for ambushing you last time?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hm?" Bai Feiyun looked up in surprise. "Alliance Head ambushed me? When?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou was also shocked. From the look in his eyes, he didn't seem to be lying. Something shocking flashed through her mind and she was so stunned that she abruptly stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared at Bai Feiyun warily. "Are you really Bai Feiyun?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun stopped flipping through the book and glanced at her strangely. "It's only been a couple months since we last saw each other, it couldn't be that Alliance Head had even forgotten about me, right? Or is it that the Disseminating Tassel Fragrance had flared up again? Alliance Head has lost her memories again?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He said this with an amused tone, but Tang Doudou sensed coldness in those words. She felt as if some sort of secret was about to be exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what secret did she have?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the past Bai Feiyun, to Baili Yu, Jun Xin, Mu Ye, and Su Yi, she was practically a transparent piece of paper. They knew all of her secrets and even secrets she didn't even know about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only secret they didn't know was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Doudou furrowed her brows. Could this be it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Feiyun has already found out that she wasn't the real Li Xueyi?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn't possible, how could they have found out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she had revealed this secret in the advanced modern world, no one would believe it. There was no way that people in the ancient era would believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if it wasn't this, what else could explain Bai Feiyun's sudden change in attitude?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, Bai Feiyun had said that it's only because of you. That sentence was still vivid in her mind like he had said it just yesterday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As of now, even though they were sitting right in front of each other, Tang Doudou could sense the strong distancing aura that Bai Feiyun was emitting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only because of you. It was only because of Li Xueyi and not her, Tang Doudou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, he thought she was Li Xueyi, that's why he had said this. However, since she was Tang Doudou, he became distant and cold and even seemed to hate her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tang Doudou's thoughts reached this point, many of the things she had been confused about became clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was like this, Tang Doudou also became certain that Bai Feiyun felt that she wasn't Li Xueyi and was thinking that she was an imposter. The idea that she was a soul that transmigrated to Li Xueyi's body definitely had not occurred to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As she had thought earlier, there was no way that Bai Feiyun could think of this no matter how intelligent he was.</span></p>
