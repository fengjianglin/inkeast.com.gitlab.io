 <p><strong>Chapter 482: I Want to Go Back</strong></p> 
 <p>Jiangfeng?<br> "Baili Jiangfeng," repeated Bai Feiyun as he reached out to take the child. He looked towards Tang Doudou gently, "He descended with the sudden wind and will have a carefree personality like the wind. How is it?"</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou repeated the name a couple times. The more she said it, the more she liked it. "Thank you."</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun didn't say anything else and carried the child as he went outside to get Tang Doudou a clean garment. "Hurry and get changed. Don't catch a cold."</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou nodded and took the clothes. Bai Feiyun then headed back to the cave entrance and faced away from her to lower his head and say something to the child.</p> 
 <p>Although it was very windy inside, the cave was abnormally warm. It was probably due to the needles Bai Feiyun had inserted, but Tang Doudou was now able to move a little. After pulling on the clothes with difficulty, she said, "Xiao Bai, give me Jiangfeng. You should go change as well."</p> 
 <p>When Bai Feiyun heard this, he walked back and placed the child back into her arms. Earlier, the two of them had protected the child so the clothing wrapped around him was still dry. However, after Bai Feiyun carried him awhile, the cloth became a little damp.</p> 
 <p>"There are no other clothes in this cave." Bai Feiyun picked up the clothing Tang Doudou had taken off and used inner strength to evaporate the water before handing it back to her. "I'm fine. I'll just use inner strength to dry it. You should change the clothes on the child as well, then feed him milk."</p> 
 <p>When he said the last part, his tone became a bit awkward and after he said it, he turned around to dry the clothing.</p> 
 <p>The two of them hadn't paid much attention to those things while the baby was being delivered, but now just thinking about it felt awkward. Due to his words earlier, Tang Doudou's ears also turned red. However, when she saw that the child was biting things everywhere like he was extremely hungry, she couldn't be bothered to care about this anymore. After changing the cloth on the child, she pulled apart her lapel to start feeding the child.</p> 
 <p>However, no matter what she did, the baby didn't seem to be able to drink it. He was becoming so anxious that he was shifting restlessly, which made Tang Doudou very anxious as well.</p> 
 <p>She wanted to ask Bai Feiyun what was going on and whether there was something wrong with the child, but she didn't know how to ask.</p> 
 <p>In the end, the child became so hungry that he started crying. The wailing startled Bai Feiyun, but he kept his back facing her as he asked, "What's wrong with the child?"</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou coughed as she looked at the crying child and finally said, "It looks like he can't eat… so he's anxious."</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun was taken aback, then he laughed. "He hasn't eaten anything since he was born so he must be hungry. It's normal for him to be anxious."</p> 
 <p>Then he said, "Even if he's panicking, you shouldn't. Guide him patiently."</p> 
 <p>Guide?</p> 
 <p>How was she supposed to guide him?</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou was completely at a loss. From what she remembered of the mothers that she saw breastfeeding, they just placed their child in front of them and the child would start eating. However, this child of hers… He's a bit dumb!</p> 
 <p>However, she still worked hard to make sure the child had his fill. Afterwards, the child fell sound asleep.</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou felt a sense of satisfaction when she saw the child sleeping peacefully, then she drifted off to sleep while holding the child.</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun only turned around once he heard their breathing become even. He sat down next to them and looked at Tang Doudou. Her hair was slightly disheveled and her cheeks were a little flushed. His gaze gradually shifted from her face to Baili Jiangfeng.</p> 
 <p>Baili Jiangfeng looked seriously too similar to Baili Yu.</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun's Adam's apple moved, then he reached out slowly for Baili Jiangfeng…</p> 
 <p>This storm lasted for an entire half a month.</p> 
 <p>When the sunlight that hadn't appeared for a long time first shone into the dim cave, Tang Doudou woke up from her dreams and blocked the light with her hands. She slowly opened her eyes and looked outside, then exclaimed, "Ah! The sun's out! Xiao Bai!"</p> 
 <p>She looked towards the cave but she didn't see Bai Feiyun anywhere. Even little Jiangfeng was gone.</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou wasn't startled in the least and just smiled as she got up to walk outside.</p> 
 <p>Although it had been storming outside the entire time, Bai Feiyun would still take advantage of the times when there wasn't rain and wind to take Xiao Jiangfeng out for walks. He said that the child couldn't stay in the cave all the time. It wouldn't be good for his vision and mental development.</p> 
 <p>In any case, he was the doctor so he was usually right. In addition, Bai Feiyun knew better than her what amount was appropriate, so she didn't bother to get involved. She spent all day sleeping or napping in the cave and the result was that she recovered extremely fast. In this half a month, she had pretty much fully recovered. </p> 
 <p>However, it was still a little difficult to walk. There was no way for her to walk as naturally as she had in the past. At the very least through, she could now walk by herself.</p> 
 <p>It was probably because the weather cleared up because Bai Feiyun had already pushed away the enormous rock in front of the cave entrance. Tang Doudou was able to leave the cave without trouble. The fresh earthy smell in the air after the rain was refreshing. She took a deep breath, then started looking around to find Bai Feiyun and Xiao Jiangfeng.</p> 
 <p>"Xiao Bai!</p> 
 <p>"Jiangfeng!</p> 
 <p>"Where are you guys?"</p> 
 <p>She didn't see Bai Feiyun anywhere in the forest. She looked around and found a trail of footprints. She laughed and started following those footprints forward. </p> 
 <p>These footprints were headed towards the direction of the sea.</p> 
 <p>So he had brought Xiao Jiangfeng to see the sea. After the tide receded, there were usually a lot of pretty shells on the shore. They had probably gone to pick seashells.</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou recalled when she taught Bai Feiyun to listen to the sounds inside the shell when they were picking shells before and smiled. There hadn't been any more Jianghu struggles and unresolved grudges these past months. Although she spent most of the time on a bed, it had to be said that this had been the most relaxed period she had ever experienced. She had thought several times that it'd be great if things could continue to be like this.</p> 
 <p>However, she understood that she still had to return to that chaotic Jianghu. Just the matter of whether Jun Xin would be able to recover from the soul-devouring bug was enough to keep her worried.</p> 
 <p>As she was thinking these things, she had already reached the beach. She looked over and saw that Bai Feiyun was standing there carrying Baili Jiangfeng as she had expected. But to her surprise, there was someone else on the beach, someone she knew.</p> 
 <p>After she saw this person, she stopped walking over and hid herself in the underbrush nearby to eavesdrop.</p> 
 <p>That person was a little angry, seemingly because all his attempts at persuading failed. "Do you think you can stay here your entire life with her just by hiding her here? No matter what, she'll go back. You should understand this, so stop making these mistakes."</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun replied mildly, "I'm not making a mistake. I will send her back, but just not now."</p> 
 <p>"You! What am I supposed to say? How long will your body even be able to hold up? You still want to drag things on? Are you really not afraid of death?"</p> 
 <p>That person pointed at Bai Feiyun in anger and helplessness. Finally, he sighed. "Let me have a look at the child."</p> 
 <p>"No."</p> 
 <p>"I just want to see what Baili's brat looks like! You're too stingy! Are you really treating him as your son? Even if you want to do that, you'd have to have that fate first!"</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun froze for a moment, then moved little Jiangfeng over to let that person have a look. However, he barely gave him a second before pulling little Jiangfeng back again. That person was speechless. "I hadn't even frickin' seen anything!"</p> 
 <p>"When he was born, he looked quite like Baili Yu, but now he looks more like her. You can imagine for yourself!" Bai Feiyun patted little Jiangfeng gently as he said this.</p> 
 <p>These words made that person so angry that he laughed. "Fine! I won't say any more. You should just think of the time yourself! Baili Yu doesn't have long to live. If you're not afraid that the girl will hate you after finding out, you can continue holing up in this island!"</p> 
 <p>After saying that, he angrily turned to leave.</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun hesitated, but then called out, "City Lord."</p> 
 <p>Su Yi stopped without speaking.</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun glanced at little Jiangfeng, then looked towards him. "Help me bring a message to Baili Yu. Back then, I had helped him so as the condition, before I die, she and the child must keep me company.</p> 
 <p>"So he should pray that he could live a little longer, or pray that I would die faster."<br> "Psyho!" cursed Su Yi.</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun didn't say anything else and walked away with little Jiangfeng .</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou was still stunned from what she heard of this exchange. By the time she snapped out of her thoughts, Bai Feiyun had already discovered her. Since there was nowhere to hide, she had no choice but to awkwardly get up and meet his gaze. She glanced towards the beach and found that Su Yi was already gone.</p> 
 <p>"I, I was looking for you." Tang Doudou didn't know what to say, but if no one spoke the atmosphere felt stifling.</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun nodded. "Yes, let's head back."</p> 
 <p>After he said that, he walked back to the cave with little Jiangfeng . Tang Doudou didn't follow after him and stayed on the beach for a long time. She thought about what he had said to Su Yi earlier as she stared at the vast ocean. What exactly had happened after she fell down the cliff?</p> 
 <p>"You're back?" When she returned, Bai Feiyun was waiting for her at the entrance of the cave.</p> 
 <p>"Yeah." Tang Doudou extended her hand and showed him the fistful of cute baby shells. "I wanted to make a necklace for Jiangfeng, so I collected some shells."</p> 
 <p>"It's windy by the sea and you still haven't recovered from your puerperium, so you shouldn't go to the beach for the time being." Bai Feiyun looked at the shells in her hand, then he picked them up and placed them in his own palm. "Jiangfeng has fallen asleep. I'll help you string these shells."</p> 
 <p>Tang Doudou glanced inside the cave and saw that little Jiangfeng was sound asleep, so she gave him the shells. "Then I'll have to trouble you." </p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun smiled softly, then went to start stringing the necklace. Near where he was, there were the toys he had made for little Jiangfeng . There were little pinwheels, rattle drums… He had made them all by hand.</p> 
 <p>He truly treated little Jiangfeng like his own child. </p> 
 <p>It was precisely due to this that she didn't know how to say it.</p> 
 <p>Bai Feiyun also didn't mention what happened and the days continue to pass like this.</p> 
 <p>It wasn't a solution to continue staying in the cave, so Bai Feiyun built another small house near the beach and they moved into it.</p> 
 <p>Little Jiangfeng 's health become better and better under Bai Feiyun's careful care. Of course, Tang Doudou's health also improved.</p> 
 <p>However, ever since that day, thoughts weighed on Tang Doudou's mind again, so she often spaced out while sitting on the beach.</p> 
 <p>Her head was filled with the thought that Baili Yu was about to die. It had been a long time. There was no way that she didn't miss Baili Yu. Whenever she recalled him, she would use the words Nangong Yan said to numb her own feelings. However, after finding out about this matter, she couldn't lie to herself anymore.</p> 
 <p>She really wanted to go back and see Baili Yu with their child!</p>
