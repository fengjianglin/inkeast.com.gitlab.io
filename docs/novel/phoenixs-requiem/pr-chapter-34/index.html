 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {

        })();
    </script> 
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“What’s the matter? What’s happened?” The others were all surprised by the sudden noise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Th, this place is a snake lair,” Zhuo Lin’er stuttered as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Mistress, quickly, run!” At the same time, Qiuqiu’s voice rang out in Yun Ruoyan’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Everyone, we have to run! The walls are embedded with snake eggs, so make sure you don’t touch them.” Yun Ruoyan quickly called out to everyone before she began running.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But it was already too late. A swarm of snakes poked their heads out of the eggs embedded on the walls, and a rain of snakes began to fall from the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Those snakes that had just emerged from their eggs were covered with a sticky fluid all over their body, and, as they fell like raindrops, a foul smell instantly smothered the cave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan and the others ran as though their lives depended on it. However, as if directed by some unknown entity, those little snakes all slithered along the walls in front of the group, forming a thick wall of snakes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Seeing that the way forward had been blocked, the party could only run back towards the fork, but they found that the way back had also been blocked by the snakes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The only path left was the right one. Without any hesitation, everyone ran in that direction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">This route didn’t seem to contain a single snake egg and was a little wider than the other one, but the swarm of snakes chasing them was like a flood just about to swallow them whole.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They didn’t know how long they’d run, but it was to the point that Yun Ruoyan felt as though her entire body were cramping up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After all, two days ago, she had just fought the saber-toothed tiger, and she still wasn’t fully recovered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Finally, ahead of them was the faint glow of moonlight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“We’re almost there, almost!” Lin Qingxue was in the lead, and she gathered the last of her flagging energy as she fervently ran towards the moon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Because Yi Qianying had sprinkled some snake-attracting powder on her body, those snakes were particularly interested in her, and some would even ignore the rest of the party in favor of pouncing on Lin Qingxue instead. This repulsion was what gave her the energy to sprint to the front and remain there.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As soon as she’d left the cave behind, she collapsed onto the ground, feeling weak all over. She kept on mumbling, “I can’t run anymore, not anymore, not even if the snakes start biting me…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Although this was what she claimed, when she felt something touch her shoulder, her whole body sprang up, and she made as if to keep running.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Stop, we’re safe!” Yun Ruoyan’s voice came from behind her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Only then did she dare turn back. The cave from which they’d all emerged was filled with snakes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Under the moonlight, they twined and curled around each other. The indistinct chatter from the contact between their tiny scales was magnified by the sheer number of bodies present until the &nbsp;noise was scalp-numbing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The strange thing was that these snakes couldn’t seem to get out of the cave, as if they were somehow restricted from moving.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Why aren’t these snakes chasing us further?” Lin Qingchen sat on the floor panting, barely able to catch her breath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Who cares? All I know is that we’re safe!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Are you both alright?” Yun Ruoyan turned toward the beastkin siblings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Lin’er had already gotten off Zhuo Yifeng’s back and was standing on the ground. Unlike the others, he wasn’t panting hard, but his face didn’t look too good.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“No.” Zhuo Yifeng shook his head. “I dropped one of the tiger’s canines behind!” His expression couldn’t help but look pained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">During the run, in order to protect his sister, although he could feel one of the canines falling from his body, he didn’t have the time or luxury to pick it up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A treasure from a mid-tier beast, enough to make at least twenty mid-grade arrows! How could he not be upset?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Brother Zhuo, don’t think too hard about it. Under those circumstances, your life’s far more important!” Lin Qingxue consoled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Brother, we’re sure to find more treasures in the future, but we only have one life.” Zhuo Lin’er peered at Lin Qingxue before saying lightly. The two girls, who seemed to enjoy opposing each other, could finally agree on something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Have we left the misdirection array, then?” Lin Qingchen asked as she inspected her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They were in a valley-like area. Under the moonlight, they could hear the chirping of birds and insects. A cool wind brushed against their faces, making them feel relaxed after their tiring ordeal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I don’t care where we are, but I want to have a good night’s rest,” Lin Qingxue muttered, and her thoughts reflected everyone else’s.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The group found a good place to set up camp for the night. Because it was the start of summer, the nights weren’t too cold, but they started a fire just as a precaution.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng, who had the best physique, would take the first watch, and the others quickly slipped into their dreams. The night was uneventful, and the others awoke to bright sunlight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan woke up upon smelling a concentrated aroma, and when she opened her eyes, she saw Zhuo Yifeng busying himself in front of the fire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Didn’t you sleep at all last night?” Yun Ruoyan walked to Zhuo Yifeng’s side, somewhat embarrassed. After all, last night, they’d agreed that Zhuo Yifeng would take first watch, and Yun Ruoyan the second, but Yun Ruoyan was so tired that she couldn’t force herself to wake up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Why didn’t you call me up?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng was busily preparing a roast, and he said without turning around, “It’s alright, I can miss sleep for a few days and still be perfectly fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan looked at his serious face in profile. To her surprise, not only were his eyes particularly bright, his eyelashes were unusually long. They curled slightly upwards, and the dawn gave his face a surprising gracefulness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It’s ready.” Zhuo Yifeng removed a skewer from the fire. As he turned his head, he locked eyes with Yun Ruoyan, and he couldn’t help but stiffen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan was looking at Zhuo Yifeng from the side, and this angle perfectly hid the birthmark on her right cheek. Her skin was pale, especially in contrast to her red garment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At that moment, Zhuo Yifeng’s three-quarters view of Yun Ruoyan seemed to have transformed into a different person entirely, a beautiful, pure, and unsullied maiden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan didn’t think much of Zhuo Yifeng’s momentary stupefaction. She smiled and took the skewer from his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“What’s this? A chicken or a large bird?” She asked, smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It’s so fragrant!” Lin Qingxue spoke up from behind them, and the two both turned around. They had been so wrapped up with each other that they hadn’t noticed Lin Qingxue waking up and emerging from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Good morning, Sister Ruoyan, Brother Zhuo!” Lin Qingxue gave the two of them a resplendent smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Good morning! Here.” Yun Ruoyan handed the skewer in her hand to Lin Qingxue. Her face was bright and sunny, but her heart went cold. How had her alertness dropped so much in the last few days?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After her rebirth, Yun Ruoyan had been a little bird, frightened by any sudden gesture and distrustful of everyone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">For a while, she slept so lightly that she would wake at the slightest disturbance, and whenever she ate, she had to secretly test her food with a silver needle beforehand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But ever since she had entered the imperial territory, her wariness had steadily dropped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Here, there’s more.” Zhuo Yifeng handed her another skewer. Yun Ruoyan absentmindedly chewed on the meat as she ate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Back then, she was alone and helpless, but now, she had trustworthy friends and family by her side. This was why she had unconsciously let down her guard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But wasn’t this a sort of dependency? Once she got used to something like this, what would she do if she became alone and helpless once more?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ah, Sister Ruoyan, you’ve eaten a share meant for two! Qingchen’s going to have to go hungry now,” Lin Qingxue suddenly exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Only then did Yun Ruoyan break out of her stupor. The large roasted chicken that she’d been consuming was now nothing more than bones; she’d eaten the whole bird by herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I got full just eating half the bird; Sister Ruoyan, how can you eat so much while remaining so thin?!” Lin Qingxue’s face was filled with shock. “How can your figure look so good like this?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I—” As soon as Yun Ruoyan opened her mouth, she let out a big burp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hahaha!” Lin Qingxue immediately began to laugh out loud. “Sister Ruoyan, you’re too cute, hahaha…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As if responding to Lin Qingxue’s laugh, Yun Ruoyan burped again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qingxue was so overcome by laughter that she couldn’t stand up straight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan didn’t know why she kept on burping, her face turning from white to red and white again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>My goodness! Was her cold, aloof image that she’d worked hard to develop ever since her rebirth about to break down just like that? No, she had to rein it in!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Burp!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng didn’t laugh in as obvious a manner. His face looked as paralyzed as ever, but his unusually limpid eyes were clearly full of mirth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The whole day, Lin Qingxue never stopped talking. Once Lin Qingchen woke up, Lin Qingxue masterfully recreated the entire scene alone, and then, when everyone sat down together for lunch, she did it again. Even Zhuo Lin’er was brought to tears from her antics.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I thought that I was the only glutton in our group, but it turns out that Sister Ruoyan’s even more of a glutton than I am! She’s been burping the whole day!” Lin Qingxue once again began to imitate her behavior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Considering her cousin’s innocence and naivete, Yun Ruoyan couldn’t bear to get angry, so she could only lower her head and pretend that nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It looked as though she would have to find a way to rein in her cousin, or the cold and aloof image that she’d built for herself ever since her rebirth would fall to pieces once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Luckily, her burping had ceased by the evening, or even she would have been unable to stand herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They’d discovered a path as they explored the mountain valley, the only path that they’d found so far. The group had already followed this path through the valley for an entire day, and while they didn’t encounter any powerful beasts, they did find quite a number of rare and valuable herbs: a variant on mugwort and rapeseed, vital mid-grade ingredients for concocting an ointment for external wounds; sage’s grass and earthbane shrooms, high-grade ingredients for treating internal injuries; and far more low- and mid-grade herbs than they could name. They barely took a few steps before finding more herbs, a small patch of which would have gone for hundreds of taels of gold in the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone was overjoyed from picking herbs, and Yun Ruoyan stuffed quite a few into her bracelet while no one was looking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Sister Ruoyan,” Lin Qingchen walked up to Yun Ruoyan’s side and asked, “Why are there so many herbs here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Do you have some insight?” Yun Ruoyan got at the heart of Lin Qingchen’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Generally, spiritual herbs tend to grow in areas with high spiritual energy. Do you think we could be in the center of the imperial territory?” Lin Qingchen revealed her own hypothesis. Having studied under Lin Zainan for quite some time, she was quite learned in some regards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Actually, Yun Ruoyan had been curious about the same thing. Could they have somehow meandered into the center of the imperial territory?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The imperial territory was shaped like a disc. The outermost regions had the lowest spiritual density, the lowest-tier beasts, and lowest-grade herbs. As they went closer to the center, the spiritual energy greatly increased in density, as did the number and quality of herbs and beasts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Given their current situation, they must have wandered into the center of the territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“But why are there only herbs, not beasts?” Lin Qingchen wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Mistress, something’s ahead!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Brother, brother!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Qiuqiu and Zhuo Lin’er cried out warnings simultaneously. There were beasts ahead!</span></p>
