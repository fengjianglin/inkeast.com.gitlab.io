 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The meat that Yun Ruoyu was grumbling about was roasted by none other than Pei Ziao.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Although she hadn’t helped out at all, she complained about every little thing, and her clear distaste made Pei Ziao feel somewhat embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Pei Ziao was holding some more meat skewers in his hands, and he was just about to hand them out when Yun Ruoyu spoke up. As a result, he simply stood still awkwardly, his face red and his hands trembling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yi Qianying reached out for one of the skewers, taking a big bite before turning to Yun Ruoyu. “It’s not that bad! Ruoyu, you’re a little too picky.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“If you like it, you can have it all! As I’ve said, it’s charred on the outside and half-raw on the inside—you might be able to consume it, but I can’t!” Yun Ruoyu’s face was lined with displeasure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It’s already really good for Brother Ziao’s first attempt!” Yi Qianying looked toward Pei Ziao with a look of adoration on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Qianying…” Pei Ziao called out gratefully, his heart about to melt under her radiant smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Perhaps half a year ago, Pei Yingxiong had sat Pei Ziao down for a serious conversation, telling him to frequent the Yun household and try to get on good terms with their sole wife-born daughter, Yun Ruoyan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It was an open secret that Yun Ruoyan was both useless and ugly, and almost no one in the upper echelons of society was unaware of that fact. But in order to maintain the family’s prosperity, Pei Ziao had no choice but to follow his father’s orders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Pei Yingxiong had promised him that she would be nothing more than an ornament after they’d gotten married. Once the Peis surpassed the Yuns, he would be able to get a divorce and find a new wife immediately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Pei Ziao had spent a tremendous amount of effort on Yun Ruoyan in the past. After all, as timid and self-abasing as she was, he had to make sure that his every gesture was moderate and kind in order to avoid frightening her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In addition, she was so sensitive that a single demeaning glance from another party would be enough to cause her to cry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone else would show an expression of disgust upon seeing the birthmark on Yun Ruoyan’s face, and it was all he could do to ignore its existence and pretend that he was wholly unaffected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Eventually, gradually, she finally got a favorable impression of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">During their mountain trip, he had known that Yun Ruoyao and Yi Qianying were scheming to push Yun Ruoyan into the lake, and had wanted to completely conquer her heart with one grand gesture. Of course, he hadn’t expected to almost die in the attempt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Luckily, he managed to survive, but Yun Ruoyan’s attitude toward him had soured completely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Pei Ziao hadn’t particularly cared about Yun Ruoyan except for his familial obligations, but her sudden aloofness actually ignited his desire to get into her good graces once more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As a dashing gentleman, the sole heir of the Peis, he could have whatever girl he wanted, let alone one as ugly and useless as Yun Ruoyan!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He forcibly suppressed his feelings for Yi Qianying and turned his gaze aside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Opposite them, Zhuo Yifeng was cutting the roasted meat into chunks. The golden-brown meat was dripping with fat, and it sizzled as it landed on the charcoal, making everyone salivate further</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The four girls all ended up staring at Zhuo Yifeng as he prepared the meat, and even Yun Ruoyan couldn’t help gulping down mouthfuls of saliva.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng carved out a large piece of meat, but he handed it to Yun Ruoyan rather than to his own sister.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan hesitated for a moment before taking the meat, but instead of eating it herself, she handed it to Lin Qingxue by her side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Thank you, Ruoyan.” Without hesitating, Lin Qingxue took a big bite. “Wow, it’s so tasty! Even more so than the chefs in the capital!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qingxue praised Zhuo Yifeng in an exaggerated fashion so loudly that Yun Ruoyu gave the whole crowd a supercilious look from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan was just about to stand up when Zhuo Yifeng handed her another chunk of meat. She frowned slightly, saying, “I’d prefer to do it myself, please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">And then she stood up, walked to the roast, and used her own little dagger to cut out two pieces of meat, one for Lin Qingchen and one for herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Oh, it really is tasty!” Yun Ruoyan took a bite and praised Zhuo Yifeng sincerely. “You’re a surprisingly good cook.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Brother Zhuo’s really skilled, isn’t he?” Lin Qingxue mumbled as she chewed, and Lin Qingchen likewise ate with gusto.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng revealed a rare smile. “We beastkin often have to hunt deep in the mountains, so we’ve amassed quite a few cooking-related skills.” As he said this, he cut the meat finely and placed it on a big green leaf before handing it to Zhuo Lin’er.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Lin’er took the proffered food and began chewing slowly, and it was only then that Zhuo Yifeng took a few bites for himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Who else is there in your clan besides you siblings?” Yun Ruoyan asked carelessly while popping a chunk of meat into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng stilled upon hearing the question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At first, Yun Ruoyan expected that he would refuse to answer, but he spoke up calmly instead. “It’s only the two of us left now, but there might be other missing members of the clan elsewhere.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Beastkin were a rather special sort of existence in the Chenyuan continent. Supposedly, the beastkin were half-blood spawns of man and beast, and had always served as slaves of the nobility, generally as hunters and beast tamers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A hundred years ago, a brave warrior emerged amongst the beastkin. He led his kinsmen to victory against their human masters, ending the perpetuation of slavery that had lasted millennia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">This warrior had seized untold amounts of riches from the hands of humans, bringing his kinsmen to the other side of the Yueli mountain and founding a beastkin kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">For a time, this kingdom coexisted with the Li, Yue, Mo, and Chen kingdoms, and there were said to be five great kingdoms on the Chenyuan continent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The warrior who had founded this kingdom was titled the Beast King.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But eighteen years ago, the Beast King had died of mysterious causes in the prime of his life. The beastkin kingdom splintered, marred by internal schism and conflict. Soon, it became no more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The beastkin once again roamed the four kingdoms as nomads.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Many adventurers, driven by greed for the treasures that the beastkins had seized from the humans, would go about hunting beastmen and interrogate them regarding where the treasure had ended up, and it was under these conditions that the beastkin population dwindled by the day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">What made Yun Ruoyan particularly curious was how Zhuo Yifeng and his sister managed to obtain tokens to enter the imperial realm despite being beastkin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Seemingly having anticipated Yun Ruoyan’s question, he said, “I once saved the master of a noble family while out hunting. He granted me a wish, which is how I’m here right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng’s openness made Yun Ruoyan a little uncomfortable, as if she were being petty and secretive in comparison.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ah, there’s no reason you have to divulge all this to me. Shouldn’t you beastkin be vigilant against us humans?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhuo Yifeng really seemed to be an exception among his kind. Even when they first talked in the morning, Zhuo Yifeng had revealed his identity as a beastkin at the very beginning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I believe in you,” Zhuo Yifeng said resolutely, looking at Yun Ruoyan with eyes that were far too bright.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Believe me?” Yun Ruoyan looked toward him, her expression uncertain. “Why? It’s the first time we’ve met!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Because your body’s suffused with a familiar scent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“What scent?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I don’t know, but it’s familiar and intimate!” Zhuo Yifeng looked at Yun Ruoyan, his eyes gleaming like those of a magical beast.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It can’t be that this fellow’s smelling my scent, can it?!” Qiuqiu chirped from the bracelet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan’s heart trembled in shock. Was this guy’s sense of smell so acute that he could even sense what was inside her pocket dimension? That defied common sense!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan’s attitude became cool once more. “You look like an honest guy, so I didn’t expect you to try to hit on me like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“No, I’m not—” Zhuo Yifeng quickly spread his hands out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Alright, I’m tired and going to rest now.” Yun Ruoyan didn’t want to hear his explanation. She walked up and to one side of the fire, preparing to lie down to sleep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Late in the night, she was jostled awake by someone. She opened her eyes to see Lin Qingxue looking at her in pain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I ate too much meat for dinner, and then a whole bottle of cold water on top of that. My stomach hurts so much! Ruoyan, could you accompany me to relieve myself?” Lin Qingxue pleaded earnestly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">And so the two girls found a location downwind and far from the fire. After Yun Ruoyan gave the signal, Lin Qingchen went to relieve herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In her boredom, Yun Ruoyan looked around her surroundings before suddenly seeing a faint glow coming from a nearby brush.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">She walked over. Under the moonlight filtering through the leaves up above, she found a pile of animal entrails near the brush, likely those that Zhuo Yifeng had cleaned out while he was preparing the meat for dinner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The funny thing was, there was an object giving off a faint green glow from within those entrails.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan unsheathed her sword and cut open the glowing organ, revealing a glowing green monster core!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After she’d cleaned it thoroughly and inspected it carefully in her hands, she could even smell a faint trace of medicinal herbs. It could only be the beast core of the bunny that had landed them within the pack of hounds in the first place!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Before the hound which had captured the bunny could fully digest it, they’d slain and eaten the hound.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The bunny had grown up feasting on such medicinal herbs, and its core would have retained some of that potency in restoring&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;">qi</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;and curing poison. In that sense, this one core was more valuable than a hundred firehound cores.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ruoyan, what’re you doing over there?” Lin Qingxue’s voice came from behind her. Yun Ruoyan quickly kept the bunny’s core in her pocket dimension and then turned around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I saw a firefly just now and wanted to catch it, but it flew away instead.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qingxue squinted at her cousin. When had she become so mischievous?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In the end, the two of them returned to the firepit to sleep, and when they next woke up, it was already morning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The next morning, as soon as everyone woke up, they went off in search of the exit to the misdirection array.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan brought up the idea of splitting into two parties once more. Yun Ruoyao and Yun Ruoyu were both fine with the suggestion, but Pei Ziao insisted on following Yun Ruoyan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">His excuse was that he had to protect and take care of her in order to thank Yun Ruoyan for saving his life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I feel like it’s best for us to work as a team,” Yi Qianying began. “None of us are familiar with the imperial territory, and if we encounter another beast horde, it’ll be better if there are more of us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After hearing Yi Qianying’s words and concluding that her party really would be too weak otherwise, Yun Ruoyao doggedly followed behind Yun Ruoyan’s group, ignoring Lin Qingxue’s taunts and Yun Ruoyan’s cold and aloof behavior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I saw that first!” Yun Ruoyu and Lin Qingxue glared at each other, both unwilling to let go of their half of a mauve medicinal herb gingerly clutched in their hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">This was already the third such incident this morning between the two girls.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">For some reason, the two of them would always see a treasure and rush to it at exactly the same time.</span></p>
