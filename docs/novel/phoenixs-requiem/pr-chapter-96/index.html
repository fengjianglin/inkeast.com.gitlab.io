 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan walked out of her rooms with furrowed brows.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Second Miss, you’re finally up!” Hong Yu was very pleased to see that Yun Ruoyan had finally been awoken by her ruckus. “Madam An wishes to discuss an important matter with you in her quarters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Yun Ruoyan pretended that Hong Yu didn’t exist. Instead, she looked toward Peony and Xi Lan. “It’s so bright and early. Where did such a noisy, squawking bird come from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Hong Yu heard herself described as a squawking bird, her face reddened, but she didn’t dare to refute Yun Ruoyan’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">During this period of time, she’d heard Madam An and the three misses discuss how Yun Ruoyan wasn’t a human, and Xiangcao and Qiuhong had gossiped to her about how she had a strange power that inflicted direct pain to their hearts. As a result, she was still quite cautious around Yun Ruoyan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But just as Peony was about to reply, Xi Lan interrupted, “Miss, it’s indeed an obnoxious pest. Shall we beat it away?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright,” Yun Ruoyan responded coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xi Lan rolled up her sleeves and picked up a broom by the side of the cottage, smacking the handle against her palm as she prepared to wave it around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Startled, Hong Yu had no choice but to retreat. It had been quite a while since she had last come to Yun Ruoyan’s residence. Not only had Yun Ruoyan changed, so had Xi Lan and Peony.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Had Xi Lan and Peony also been possessed by demons?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Xi Lan, how dare you hit me!” Forced back to the cottage’s entrance, Hong Yu could only point at Xi Lan and shout with false bravado.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Xi Lan raised the broom in her hands high up in the air, she shouted, “So what if I’ve hit you? Do you think we’re pushovers?!” She hurled the broom at Hong Yu, who was so scared that she yelled out in panic and leaped out of the cottage. Before she left, she shouted once more that Madam An was summoning Yun Ruoyan for an urgent matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xi Lan put her hands on her hips and laughed loudly as she saw Hong Yu stumbling away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Miss, it’s been quite a while since Madam An last tried to cause trouble for you,” Peony commented. “I wonder what she’s up to this time?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan smiled. To deal with someone like Madam An, she had to face her head-on without trying to hide. “Peony, help me comb my hair. I’ll be going to Madam An’s residence.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan turned and headed back into her rooms to dress. Moments later, she emerged. In a lotus-colored gown and with a lotus-flower gauze patch on her cheek, Yun Ruoyan walked over to Madam An’s residence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as she stepped into the yard, she saw huge swathes of peonies. Their scent was overwhelming, as was their mistress, who was dressed in a flamboyant, peony-red dress.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ruoyan, you’re here! Quick, come in. The sun’s just about to start burning.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan smiled as she let Madam An pull her inside. “Mother, I heard Hong Yu say that you had an urgent matter that you needed me for. What’s the problem?” Yun Ruoyan appeared to be gentle and affectionate. If Madam An wanted to pretend to be the warm, caring mother, then she would let her do so.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Madam An heard Yun Ruoyan’s obedient voice, her scalp couldn’t help but prick. Her gentle, smiling face suddenly reminded her of the red fox from her past. She immediately released Yun Ruoyan’s hand, her expression equal parts terrified and fearful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mother, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, yes, I’m fine.” Madam An patted her hair in an attempt to hide her discomfort before sitting down at her tea table. “Come sit, Ruoyan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan was quite curious as to why Madam An appeared so discomfited today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Madam An instructed one of her maids to begin serving tea. When Madam An said nothing even after Yun Ruoyan had two sips, she finally asked, “Mother, didn’t you have an urgent matter that you needed me for? I still have to pay my respects to Grandmother today…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, the thing is,” Madam An began, “My nephew went out hunting recently and gave me a red fox pelt as a gift. The color’s too flamboyant for me, so I thought I’d pass it along. If you’re interested, take it and have a vest or scarf made out of it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She glanced at Yun Ruoyan as she spoke, trying to detect any abnormalities in her appearance. Although the spiritual master had judged that Yun Ruoyan wasn’t, in fact, a demon, Madam An wasn’t quite so certain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">More questions popped up in Yun Ruoyan’s mind. Giving a fox pelt to her in the middle of the summer? “Mother, you should leave such a wonderful gift for Ruoyao,” Yun Ruoyan countered. “How could I accept it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, I’ve already given all your sisters part of it, so you can’t refuse. Otherwise, people might think that I’m prejudiced toward you.” Madam An signalled for Hong Yu to retrieve the pelt and laid it out in front of Yun Ruoyan. The fiery-red fur was lustrous and attractive, indeed a top-tier pelt by all standards. “Well, Ruoyan? Do you like it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Madam An scrutinized Yun Ruoyan once more. Not quite understanding her intentions, Yun Ruoyan could only smile and decline cautiously, “It really is quite charming, but I think it’s too flamboyant for me as well. Why not give it to Qianying? I’m sure she’ll love having more!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, no, it suits you just fine!” Madam An insisted. “Won’t it suit your phoenix-orchid gauze patch? Come winter, if you wear both this pelt and that gauze patch, you’d look just like a phoenix from afar!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan really couldn’t reject a gift from her mother without coming off as grossly impolite. In addition, she couldn’t detect anything amiss with the pelt. After another bout of hesitation, she finally relented and accepted it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As she left with the pelt in hand, Yun Ruoyan couldn’t help but wonder what had come across Madam An today. She looked at the pelt in her hands once more, frowning. It would be better to have Lin Qingchen take a look as well, just in case there was something that she’d missed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After Yun Ruoyan left, the spiritual master stepped out from behind the curtains in Madam An’s rooms. “Well? She accepted the pelt, didn’t she? If she were possessed by a fox demon, she wouldn’t have accepted it so readily. In addition, she didn’t seem to be panicking upon seeing the pelt at all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Could my suspicions really be misplaced?” Madam An mumbled to herself. “But she’s clearly behaving like a different person entirely…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Perhaps it’s because she’s finally wisened up to the error in her ways, or perhaps there’s some other reason,” the spiritual master murmured, stroking his beard. Suddenly, he turned to Madam An. “Madam, is there some other reason you’re trying to get rid of this daughter of yours?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not expecting the spiritual master to ask such a question, Madam An was temporarily caught unprepared. The spiritual master suddenly began to laugh. “Did you know that demons have a surprising propensity to show up in noble households? After I’ve caught so many of them, some things naturally become clear. Regardless of whether she’s possessed or not, Madam, don’t you want to get rid of her?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only after some reflection did Madam An respond to the spiritual master’s questions. With a calm expression plastered on her face, she stated, “The Yun family has always been well regulated, and we can’t have someone breaking this peace. That’s why…” Madam An slowly turned to the spiritual master and continued earnestly and solemnly, “Even if it’s unclear what exactly that girl is, for the sake of the Yun family, I have to get rid of her!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Madam An finally revealed her true intentions, burdened though they were by a tenuous leap of logic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After hearing Madam An’s solemn words, the spiritual master couldn’t help breaking out into laughter. “In that case, I can surely lend you a hand, Madam. I have only one condition.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As long as you can handle it, Master, money’s not a problem,” Madam An replied anxiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t require money, Madam.” The spiritual master shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In that case, what condition do you have in mind?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spiritual master opened his mouth, his features screwed up as if he were about to cry. He slowly enunciated, “I want the girl.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?” Madam An could hardly believe what she’d heard. “You want the girl, Yun Ruoyan?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What for?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spiritual master’s smile vanished, replaced once more by grave dignity. In a low voice, he warned, “Madam, you don’t have to worry about this. I’ll remove her from the Yun family, but I want her person.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Madam An looked at the spiritual master. After a moment, as if she suddenly realized something, a trace of anger seeped into her features, and the spiritual master’s sanctified, priestly image crumbled to pieces in her mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There wasn’t a single good man in this world, and even Daoists…!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was a little too much for Madam An. No matter how she detested Yun Ruoyan, she was still a young miss of the Yun family, Yun Lan’s child by blood. Even if she were to kill her, it would be a clean death. Allowing her to be defiled, however, was still a step too cruel for Madam An.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you’re unwilling, Madam, then forget it.” The spiritual master began to walk out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I’m willing.” Madam An finally overcame her mental hurdle. No matter what, she couldn’t let Yun Ruoyan stay in the Yun family!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good!” The spiritual master turned toward Madam An, not a hint of his passion and excitement&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Showing on his face. When Yun Ruoyan entered the room, he had discovered a tremendous secret.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This so-called demon was actually a legendary human furnace!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spiritual master wasn’t a particularly talented individual. Except for his cultivation as a blademaster and some experience at catching demons, he had no other skills to his name. Nevertheless, after many long years of cultivation, along with rare and esoteric methods, he had somehow advanced all the way to a peak ninth-rank blademaster. He was only one small breakthrough away from the mythical tenth-rank, the apex of blademaster cultivation!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But that was almost impossible. As far as he knew, in the thousand years since the Chenyuan continent had first formed, no human had ever managed to ascend to tenth rank. He, just like everyone before him, would remain stuck at peak ninth-rank.</span></p>
