 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p>The skies were still pouring when servants from the Pei family threw Yun Ruoyan onto the streets as if they were discarding a dog’s carcass.</p>
 <p>There were quite a few people walking through the streets, discussing the upcoming execution of the Yun and Lin families. When they saw Yun Ruoyan being thrown out from the manor, all they thought was that she was simply a handmaid who had committed some grave sin or another; no one could have imagined that she had once been a full daughter of the Yun family, nor wife to the master of the Pei household.</p>
 <p>Rain soaked Yun Ruoyan’s body. Before she married into the Peis, she had even started a big fight with her grandmother because of the relationship between her and Pei Ziao. Based on today’s events, however, she was clearly the one at fault.</p>
 <p>Grandmother, grandmother… she was the only one who had truly treated her well in this world. No matter what, Yun Ruoyan had to see her once more before the execution, even if it was only to apologize ineffectually.</p>
 <p>But after long periods of torture and the poison that she had just ingested, she no longer had the ability to stand up of her own volition. After trying and failing a few times, the most she could manage was to crawl along the floor as she pulled herself forward with her arms.</p>
 <p>The rain mixed with bloody rivulets on her body, leaving a frightening trail along the street as Yun Ruoyan crawled onward.</p>
 <p>Almost, she was almost at the stage!</p>
 <p>But before she could approach any further, a call rang out, “It’s time—!”</p>
 <p>“No, no…” Yun Ruoyan reached out in the direction of her family, yelling out with the last of her breath, but her voice was completely drowned out by the wind and rain.</p>
 <p>When Yun Ruoyan next regained her senses, all she could see were trails of blood that stemmed from the stage. Streaks of blood, diluted pink from the rain, stained her gown.</p>
 <p>A trail of bloody tears fell from her eyes.</p>
 <p>Was this the end? She hadn’t even been able to see her family one last time before their execution! In her sorrow and grief, as her breathing became uneven and ragged, she felt blood and bile rising up her throat.</p>
 <p>And as she lay dying, Yun Ruoyan couldn’t help but cry wretchedly in the rain. It was a heart-rending sound, as if she were trying to expel all her grievances and suffering at once to the heavens.</p>
 <p>The Yuns and Lins, both prosperous families, summarily executed—all due to her, Yun Ruoyan! And it was then that she swore once more: were she ever to live again, she would never allow herself to suffer so, nor forgive those who had left her in such dire straits. Oh, how she hated herself, her naivete and lack of perception, and those who had orchestrated this debacle!</p>
 <p>An umbrella opened up over Yun Ruoyan’s head, accompanied by a curious voice. “Yun Ruoyan?”</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan was lying on the floor, her eyes barely open. All she could see was a dark robe with gold embroidery, the signature of royalty.</p>
 <p>“I thought that you’d have woken up and seen the truth sooner.” His tone was uninflected, almost callous, as if he were stating a fact.</p>
 <p>“Ha…” Yun Ruoyan curled up, smelling the scent of blood rising all around her. “Even if I become a malicious spirit, I won’t ever spare them!”</p>
 <p>“That sounds more like the you I remember.” The dark-robed man’s voice rang out again. He stooped down and stroked Yun Ruoyan’s hair. “As you know, the weak don’t have the right to live.”</p>
 <p><em>Without the right to live?</em></p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan squeezed out a smile as her surroundings turned icy, as if her breath would freeze in her throat. If she could relive these days, she would never, never allow such calamity!</p>
 <p>The man heard no further response from her. He extended a slender finger towards her nose, frowning.</p>
 <p>A black-clad guard beside him looked at the woman on the ground, his cold features expressionless. “Your Highness, she appears to be dead.”</p>
 <p>Only then did the man retract his finger. “Yes, you’re right.”</p>
 <p><em>Cough! Cough, cough!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>When Yun Ruoyan came to once more, all she felt was a buzzing in her brain that caused her to cough violently. Only when she’d stopped did she slowly open her eyes and stare at the sight in front of her. It took some time before the fog in front of her eyes cleared up, as if she had been awoken in the middle of a nightmare.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a person dressed like a maid rushed to her front, calling out excitedly, “Miss, you’re finally awake! Oh, I was so scared! How did you end up falling into such a deep sleep?”</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan looked at her in a daze, not speaking for quite a long moment.</p>
 <p>She faintly recalled this face. It seemed to be one of her handmaids she’d had before her marriage, a warm, intelligent girl.</p>
 <p>But she had gotten married three years ago, and never had she seen that maid again.</p>
 <p>“Peony?” Yun Ruoyan asked cautiously.</p>
 <p>Peony replied immediately, “Yes, Miss, I’m right here!”</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan fell into a daze.</p>
 <p>What had happened? She clearly remembered being force-fed poison by Pei Ziao, and the horrifying execution of the Yun and Lin families, and her falling down amidst the rain, and then…nothing.</p>
 <p>She should have died! Peony should never have appeared in front of her, unless…she had come back to life once more!</p>
 <p>“Miss, is something wrong?” Seeing that Yun Ruoyan was in a daze, Peony glanced at her surreptitiously a few times. “Miss, if we don’t head over to the old madam’s residence now, we’ll be late…”</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan felt as though her head were filled with cotton. She pulled off her blankets and got up immediately. “Peony, my head’s hurting a little. Can you remind me what happened?”</p>
 <p>“Of course your head will hurt, miss, you’ve slept for so long!” As Peony helped Yun Ruoyan get up, she recounted, “The old madam just sent word saying that a jade ornament that the empress dowager herself bequeathed to her has gone missing, so everyone has gathered at the great hall to figure out what could have happened. We can’t be late!”</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan stilled once more.</p>
 <p>Her grandmother, the empress dowager, the jade ornament, missing…</p>
 <p>She remembered this series of events very clearly, but it was something that had happened five years ago. The whole family made a big fuss about this incident, and somehow, she ended up being the scapegoat. But she hadn’t done anything at all; she was clearly framed!</p>
 <p>Because of this event, even her grandmother had turned against her.</p>
 <p>Had she really gone back five years into the past? Had the heavens seen fit to bestow upon her a new life, after she had died at the hands of Yi Qianying and Pei Ziao?</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan sat in front of her dresser. Reflected in the mirror was a youthful face, which might have been pretty but for a bright red birthmark on her right cheek, extending from the corner of her eye to the base of her nose, giving her a frightening appearance.</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyan raised her hand and touched her birthmark.</p>
 <p>Had the heavens heard her plea? If so, she wouldn’t fritter away this opportunity. To those who had planned and plotted against her, she would repay her debt in blood!</p>
 <p>She clearly remembered that Yi Qianying was the one who had stolen the jade ornament, but her shame and self-abasement had prevented her from daring to speak the truth. There had to be a reason the heavens had sent her back to this specific time, and she certainly wouldn’t repeat the same mistake!</p>
 <p>And as for Pei Ziao, he too would pay.</p>
 <p>“Peony, something simple will do. Grandmother’s matter is urgent, so we shouldn’t let everyone wait.”</p>
 <p>Peony glanced at Yun Ruoyan’s reflection in the mirror. The young miss seemed to have changed after her long map, but she couldn’t quite make out how.</p>
 <p>She dared only glance at her once before dropping her gaze and carefully brushing her long hair. “Yes, miss.”</p>
 <p>Quickly after, accompanied by Peony, Yun Ruoyan walked towards the gathering.</p>
