 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Xiu faced the kneeling Pei Ziao, but his sharp gaze was fixed on Li Qianxiao.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In each of the four kingdoms of the Chenyuan continent, there had been historical precedent for the crown prince seizing the throne. As a result, while the crown princes of each kingdom were bestowed with power and authority, they were also subject to close scrutiny. This was how it had been for Li Xiu, and this was how it would be for Li Qianxiao.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Li Xiu’s gaze swept over him, Li Qianxiao forced his demeanor to remain calm. Turning to Li Xiu and bowing, he explained, “Father, I’ve drunk overmuch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Xiu hmphed before turning back to Pei Ziao. “What case do you wish to report?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pei Ziao took a deep breath to calm his nerves before recounting what had happened to him this evening: how he had been knocked out and how Yi Qianying had vanished. Naturally, he omitted the fact that Yi Qianying had been drugged with an aphrodisiac.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan, who was still trapped in Li Mo’s lap, also perked up her ears. Yi Qianying had drugged her, and she’d returned the favor. When Yun Ruoyan returned to the party and didn’t see Yi Qianying and Pei Ziao, she was all but certain that they’d found a place to deal with the aphrodisiac.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She’d been planning on threatening the couple with knowledge of this fact, but who would have expected things to develop in this manner? Yi Qianying had actually vanished!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sister Qianying’s been kidnapped? Goodness, what shall we do?” Yun Ruoyan exclaimed from Li Mo’s lap, deep concern seemingly exuding from her voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yan’er, don’t be too worried. We’re in the interior of the palace, and it’s very safe. I’m sure your sister will be found soon.” Li Mo had once sent Li Qianhan to inspect Yun Ruoyan’s living situation at home, and naturally knew that she was at odds with her sisters. What was Yun Ruoyan trying to accomplish with her sudden act of concern?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But, no matter what Yun Ruoyan wanted to do, Li Mo would be happy to go along with it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He turned to Li Xiu and said, “Brother, who would have the gall to kidnap someone within the palace? The offender must be harshly punished!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Naturally.” Li Xiu’s usually smiling face turned solemn, and he immediately sent out guards to comb the palace for the missing Yi Qianying and the culprit who had committed such a heinous crime.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In his urgency, Pei Ziao hadn’t noticed Yun Ruoyan and Li Mo. Only when Yun Ruoyan made her dramatic exclamation did he notice that she was right there by his side. When he saw that Yun Ruoyan was sitting in the Slaughtering King’s lap, he too was very shocked, and his gaze couldn’t help but linger on the couple.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan suddenly raised her head to look at Pei Ziao. Although he was a little shocked, he didn’t panic: he coolly met and held her gaze before turning away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pei Ziao didn’t seem to be lying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Did Yi Qianying really get kidnapped? Who could have done it?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Li palace was well guarded at all times, and it was highly unlikely that an intruder would be able to break through layer after layer of security, unless the culprit was from the palace itself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan’s gaze surveilled the crowd. Some of the scions had noticed the commotion and were looking over to Pei Ziao. Others were unperturbed and continued to do their own things. None seemed guilty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The last person Yun Ruoyan’s gaze touched was the crown prince, Li Qianxiao.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His head was bowed, his waist bent. It seemed that he’d been maintaining such an uncomfortable posture for quite a while. Li Qianxiao’s anxiety was almost palpable. Although he was making a commendable effort to hide it, his antics couldn’t escape Yun Ruoyan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When she linked his current guilt to his lascivious personality and the fact that he’d only shown up at the banquet well after it had begun…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She couldn’t help but smile in satisfaction at having figured out the mystery.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yan’er, what’re you thinking of to make you so happy?” Li Mo whispered into her ear again. “Won’t you tell me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan shuddered as her scalp went numb once more. With a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes, she turned. “Slaughtering King, would you like to see a show?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? I’ll watch anything you put on, my dear Miss Yun.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two shared conniving smiles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Young Master Pei,” Yun Ruoyan began, “Can you show us where my cousin and you were attacked? I’m quite worried, and I’d like to partake in the effort of finding my cousin as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ruoyan’s right—sitting here and waiting isn’t going to solve our problems.” Unusually, Yun Ruoyao actually agreed with her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Mo added, “Given how big the palace is, trying to comb through every nook and cranny will take significant time. Since the banquet’s about to end, why don’t we have everyone help out? We’ll start with where this Young Master Pei was attacked.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Xiu naturally wouldn’t disagree with Li Mo’s suggestions. The emperor, empress, and about thirty scions followed Pei Ziao to the outer gardens.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pei Ziao stopped as he reached a small courtyard by the northwestern corner of the imperial gardens. “I was knocked unconscious right around here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan inspected her surroundings and frowned. “Young Master Pei, why did Sister Qianying follow you to such an isolated location?” Yun Ruoyan’s seemingly innocuous question immediately stimulated a round of hushed whispers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This crowd of teenagers naturally understood why a couple would want to hide in an isolated corner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ruoyan, everyone, please don’t misunderstand,” Pei Ziao immediately began defending himself. “It wasn’t Qianying who followed me here, but rather she who summoned me here. I have a witness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can vouch for Young Master Pei.” The blue-clad young master who had been initiating a conversation with Yun Ruoyao stood up. “Before the banquet began, I was deep in discussion with Young Master Pei about fighting stances. Miss Yi suddenly walked up to him and said that she had an important matter to inform him of. Because she did seem very flustered, Young Master Pei left with her.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, is that so?” Yun Ruoyan nodded before continuing, “In that case, I wonder what urgent matter my cousin had to say to Young Master Pei?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In his haste to distance himself from the matter, Pei Ziao almost told the truth: that Yi Qianying had been fed an aphrodisiac. But just as he was about to speak, he swallowed his words once more. The truth would likely spark even more accusations, and it would be more expedient to pretend he didn’t know anything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not sure either. Before she was able to tell me, I’d been knocked unconscious.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Finding Qianying’s the highest priority right now; let’s not worry about other things for the moment,” Yun Ruoyao urgently called out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright, everyone, spread out and start searching.” As soon as Li Xiu spoke, the crowd dispersed in search of Yi Qianying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A eunuch brought Li Xiu, the empress, and Li Mo a few chairs. Li Xiu motioned to Li Mo, “Fourth brother, let’s have a seat while they search.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Mo dragged Yun Ruoyan to his side. Just as he sat down, he suddenly remembered something. “Brother, do you remember a greenhouse around here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course,” Li Xiu answered, hiding a grimace. That greenhouse had been made for his rare, special breeds of plants and grasses. When Li Mo had entered the palace, he’d taken over the greenhouse, uprooted all his plants, and replaced them with medicinal herbs instead. Li Mo had mourned the loss of his plants for quite a while afterwards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Li Xiu was old enough to be Li Mo’s father, the latter’s aura always seemed to overpower him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fourth brother, what makes you bring it up?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s been quite a while since I’ve been to this part of the gardens. Brother, could you accompany me to that greenhouse?” Li Mo smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was rare that this brother of his would show such an interest, and Li Xiu was naturally willing to accommodate him. “Of course, brother.” Li Xiu stood up. “We’ll go right away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as Li Qianxiao heard Li Mo’s words, his legs went soft and he almost fell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Xiao’er, are you feeling unwell? Now that the banquet’s over, why don’t you go have a rest?” the empress advised, having discovered something amiss with her son.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if freed from a great burden, Li Qianxiao was just about to do so when Li Xiu suddenly called out from the front, “How can men be so weak? It’s rare that your uncle’s interested in touring the palace, so we’ll all accompany him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Qianxiao’s heart sunk as he trudged behind the party. Surely no one would have discovered his involvement in the affair? After all, he was the crown prince. Who would dare accuse him carelessly? Even if they did, without any real proof, what could they do?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His heart gradually calmed down, and even his legs stopped trembling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The moon was particularly bright that night, and the moonstones inlaid all over the garden made the visibility almost as clear as day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan was right by Li Mo’s side. When she tilted her head slightly, she was able to track how Li Qianxiao’s expression changed over the course of the walk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her gaze landed on his purple-gold crown, which was shaking visibly with his head. Her smile couldn’t help but deepen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eunuch Chang was tasked with tending to this part of the gardens, and he guided their way. When they reached the greenhouse, Eunuch Chang turned and bowed to Li Xiu and Li Mo. “It’s too dark within the greenhouse, so please allow me to light some lamps inside first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He brought a few eunuchs-in-training into the greenhouse with him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he was confident that he wouldn’t be found out, Li Qianxiao still couldn’t help clenching his fists.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Xiu looked at the greenhouse and couldn’t help sighing. “It’s too long since I’ve been here. I remember the rare plants that I’d been cultivating; I could easily spend an entire day just pruning and attending to them. Will I ever have such carefree days again?”</span></p>
