 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Yun Ruoyan and the others heard about this, they immediately rushed forward into the greenhouse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps because of his panic, Li Qianxiao tripped and fell forward, his head barely avoiding Yun Ruoyan to his front.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Mo stretched out an arm and blocked Li Qianxiao from hitting Yun Ruoyan’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Watch where you’re going,” Li Mo turned back and criticized Li Qianxiao.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan didn’t pay much attention to the two of them, and instead clutched the item in her hands more tightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Xiu walked at the front, and it took only two steps for him to reach the entrance to the greenhouse. He was about to step inside when Eunuch Chang called out, “Your Majesty, please wait!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Li Xiu had already strode forth, revealing a scene he could never have imagined.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eunuch Chang had only managed to light a single lamp in the greenhouse before running outside, so it was still quite dim in the interior of the greenhouse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But in this faint light, Li Xiu could still see the nude girl lying on the floor of the greenhouse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah!” The empress shouted in shock before turning back and quickly walking away, dragging Li Qianhan with her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Xiu’s eyes widened to twice their original size. He critically examined the girl’s body all over before suddenly turning around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan glanced at Yi Qianying, then at Li Mo. He was looking at him, his dark eyes gleaming.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Mo glanced at Yun Ruoyan and slowly murmured, “Now that we’ve found your sister, aren’t you going to see how she’s doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then did Yun Ruoyan reveal a shocked and terrified expression. “Sister Qianying!” She rushed over hurriedly. The girl lay spread-eagled on the ground, her hair mussed up, her pale white skin marred with green-purple bruises all over. There were even a few traces of blood by her lower body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan’s smile slowly vanished. She clenched her fist tightly, not caring that her fingernails dug into her palm, shivering all over as she shut her eyes. Memories from the past filled her brain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sister, today’s the day the Yun and Lin families are to be beheaded. Won’t you go have a look?” Yi Qianying had asked with a smile plastered on her face and a bowl of poison in her hands. Yi Qianying, whom she’d always treated like a little sister!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As ugly a girl as you, sister… how could you dream of accompanying Brother Ziao for life?” Yi Qianying scoffed. “Sister, did you know that Brother Ziao was so disgusted by you that he was too nauseated to eat?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sister, if you weren’t the sole wife-born daughter of the Yuns, would Brother Ziao ever deign to talk to someone as ugly as you? Just bringing you outside with him would embarrass him to no end!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yi Qianying poured the poison slowly into her mouth. “Sister, don’t worry. Once you pass away, I’ll take good care of both the Yun family businesses and your husband for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yi Qianying looked gently at Pei Ziao. “Brother Ziao, why don’t we throw her outside? Otherwise, it would dirty our shack for storing firewood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Barely clinging on to life, Yun Ruoyan was thrown out the Peis’ front door. Using the last of her remaining strength, she questioned, “Aren’t you afraid of retribution?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan would never forget Yi Qianying’s smiling response. “Retribution? Oh, certainly. Unfortunately, you’re a piece of trash, and I’ll never face any retribution from you in this lifetime!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan finally opened her eyes wide, the pain from her past memories once again quashed within the recesses of her heart. She slowly stooped down and covered Yi Qianying’s nude upper body with her clothes scattered on the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Serenely, she muttered, in a voice so soft none but she could hear, “Retribution will always come for you, even if it’s for a sin you committed in your previous lifetime.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Scandalous, scandalous!” Outside the greenhouse, the empress gasped as she took deep breaths. “That something like this would happen within the palace… when I catch the culprit, I’m going to skin him!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Qianxiao’s heart began palpitating again, his vision filled with Yi Qianying’s bruised skin. He didn’t realize he’d hurt her so. When he left the greenhouse, Yi Qianying’s body wasn’t, in fact, so heavily bruised. However, her skin was sensitive, and the long period of time she spent on the cold floor had aggravated her bruises.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I clearly covered her up before she left, but this girl must have moved around!” Li Qianxiao mumbled angrily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Pei Ziao and the other scions heard that Yi Qianying had been found, they all rushed to the greenhouse. However, without exception, they were all barred at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Yun Ruoyan pushed open the entrance to the greenhouse. “Let Sister Ruoyao enter, please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyao quickly walked to the entrance. She frowned and glanced at Yun Ruoyan, who shifted aside to let her pass, her expression calm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Yun Ruoyao entered the greenhouse and saw Yi Qianying lying on the floor, she immediately sucked in a deep breath. Her sister’s reputation would be forever stained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the Chenyuan continent, women with tarnished reputations had extremely poor marriage prospects, no matter how noble their birth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Qianying, Qianying, wake up, please, wake up!” Yun Ruoyau grabbed Yi Qianying, shaking her softly and shouting into her ear. After a moment, Yi Qianying finally responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brother Ziao, stop, I don’t want it…” Yi Qianying didn’t seem to be fully awake, and she kept on murmuring Pei Ziao’s name.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Qianying, open your eyes. Tell me who did it—was it Pei Ziao?” Yun Ruoyan shook Yi Qianying’s shoulder until she finally widened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She glanced quizzically at Yun Ruoyao’s furious expression. “Sister Ruoyao, is something the matter?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is something the matter? Look at yourself!” Yun Ruoyao lowered her voice and criticized her. “You’ve destroyed the reputation of the Yun family!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Yi Qianying was from the Yi family, she had grown up with and been educated by the Yuns. Now that something like this had happened, it was the Yun family who would lose face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only when Yi Qianying leaned down to inspect her body did she fully awaken in shock. Clearly, she too was dumbstruck by her own appearance. She wanted to scream, but Yun Ruoyao clutched her mouth in the nick of time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t you think you’ve disgraced yourself enough?!” Yun Ruoyao whispered vehemently. “The scions of the entire Li nobility are right outside! Did you want everyone in the capital to know of your plight?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yi Qianying panicked even more after hearing Yun Ruoyao’s words. She grabbed her wrist and cried out, “Sister, what should I do? Where’s Brother Ziao? I’m sure he’ll take responsibility for me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think not.” Yun Ruoyan crossed her arms and said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then did Yi Qianying notice Yun Ruoyan’s presence. Her eyes immediately went wide, as if she’d seen a ghost. “Why, why, you…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyan knew what she was thinking even before she said it. “You want to know why I’m doing just fine, while you were drugged?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you talking about? What drugs?” Yun Ruoyao asked suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our dear sister drugged me with an aphrodisiac. Rather than harming me, however, she ended up being the affected one herself.” Yun Ruyoan looked at Yi Qianying and smiled coldly. “This is retribution. Would you like to hear another piece of news? Your Brother Ziao doesn’t seem to be willing to admit it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did you say?” Yi Qianying stood up all of a sudden and shouted, “No, there’s no way! He wouldn’t!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyao shook her head in disappointment as she looked at Yi Qianying’s disheveled appearance. She had intended to make use of her, but she had ruined herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let me find Brother Ziao! I need to talk to him!” Yi Qianying tried to stand, but the pain that radiated from her lower half made her fall back down again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was he who told us to come find you.” Yun Ruoyan looked at her coldly. “In front of everyone, he announced that he was knocked unconscious in the outer gardens. By the time he woke up, you were already gone. According to him, he wasn’t the one who relieved you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yi Qianying shook her head in a daze. “No, no, it couldn’t be…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She looked toward Yun Ruoyao and begged, “Sister Ruoyao, please bring Brother Ziao over to me. Please, I beg you, find him!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyao didn’t want to look at this sister of hers at all, but she had to act the part of her elder sister. “Tidy up your clothes. Pei Ziao’s right outside, as is the emperor. We’ll reclaim justice for you, Qianying.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yun Ruoyao opened the door to the greenhouse, and Li Xiu, Li Mo, the empress, Li Qianxiao, and Pei Ziao walked in, while everyone else remained outside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What in the world happened?” A young master asked a skinny eunuch-in-training. Coincidentally, that was one of the eunuchs who had followed Eunuch Chang into the greenhouse to light the lamps.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skinny eunuch looked all around him before whispering, “Oh, it was terrible! That miss’s skin was all mottled green and purple!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really, that really happened to her?!” the youth exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course!” The eunuch couldn’t help but raise his voice. “I saw with my own eyes that—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a dull thunk, Eunuch Chang’s fist landed on his head. “Do you want your tongue to be cut off?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skinny eunuch immediately shuddered and walked off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the beginning, the scions didn’t completely believe the skinny eunuch, but Eunuch Chang’s swift censure gave his words more credibility.</span></p>
