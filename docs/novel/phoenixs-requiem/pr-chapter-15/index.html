 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

        (function() {
            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";
                }
            }
        })();
    </script> 
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The next morning, before Yun Ruoyan could wake up naturally, she heard loud clamors from outside. “Sister, haven’t you woken up yet? Let’s go out and play!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan instantaneously felt a headache impending. Being disturbed so early in the morning would really affect her mood for the rest of the day. “Peony, Xi Lan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Hearing their mistress’s call, Peony and Xi Lan quickly rushed into her room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The two of them began to help make Yun Ruoyan presentable. As they did so, Xi Lan grumbled, “Miss, the two young ladies were here particularly early in the morning, and although I told them you were still sleeping, they refused to listen…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It’s not your fault.” Yun Ruoyan sat in front of her dresser. “Yun Ruoyao’s been pampered from birth, so she’s not someone the two of you have a chance against.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As soon as she finished speaking, Yun Ruoyao and Yi Qianying entered her rooms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Sister, Qianying and I are here to congratulate you.” Yun Ruoyao beamed. “Your cultivation’s really an asset for the Yun family!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They...didn’t believe that at all, did they?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After all, Yun Ruoyan surely didn’t think that these two sisters of hers, who had suffered defeat at her hand, would ever congratulate her in a heartfelt manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">She didn’t respond to the compliment, but rather asked, “Sister, are you here for something in particular?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">No one would be happy to be ignored just like that, but Yun Ruoyao hid her emotions well. “Qianying and I are here to invite you to go on a mountain trip with us to relax.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan’s hand stilled, and a pearl earring fell from her hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Peony quickly helped Yun Ruoyan pick it up and put it on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A trip to the mountains?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Although Yun Ruoyan had failed to secure admission into the imperial territory in her previous life, this same event had happened back then. At the time, she was “accidentally” pushed into a half-frozen pond by Yi Qianying, and had come precipitously close to death. In order to save her, Pei Ziao had fallen into a coma, and, in response to his kindness, she had all but begged her grandfather for a high-grade pill that had been passed down the Lin family for generations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In this life, were her good sisters going to play the same trick on her?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Seeing her hesitation, Yun Ruoyao added, “Young Master Pei will be there too!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In the past, she really didn’t know how to hide her emotions at all, and it was particularly obvious whom she’d liked. As long as someone were to mention Pei Ziao’s name, she would obediently follow suit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Oh, how stupid she was!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan smiled. “In that case, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyao and Yi Qianying looked at each other, both smiling gleefully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">By the time the three of them arrived at the mountaintop, Pei Ziao was already waiting there for them. He quickly ran up to the trio and stopped in front of Yun Ruoyan. “Ruoyan, it’s been so long since we last saw each other. Have you been well?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Quite well, thank you,” Yun Ruoyan responded politely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">This sort of attitude made Pei Ziao somewhat discomfited—in the past, Yun Ruoyan had always latched onto him and had treasured his every word!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ruoyan, are you feeling unwell today?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“No, I’m not, but perhaps I’ve walked a little too much?” Yun Ruoyan didn’t even deign to look at him. She was worried that, if she saw that familiar face once more, she might not be able to help herself from strangling him!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Then let’s go to the front and rest!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At this point, Yun Ruoyao and Yi Qianying had long since run to the front. They were muttering quietly to each other, but then turned around simultaneously to wave at Yun Ruoyan and Pei Ziao. “Come quickly, the water here is so clear!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Seeing the smiling faces of the duo from afar, all Yun Ruoyan felt was a bitter chill.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">These two people were her sisters, but all they looked forward to was her death! They smiled at her so brilliantly, but as soon as she turned around, they’d drop all pretenses and stab her in the back!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ruoyan, let’s go see the lake together!” Pei Ziao pulled Yun Ruoyan forward as he ran.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As for Yun Ruoyan, she hesitated a little before pulling her hand back out of his grasp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In her last life, Yi Qianying had pushed her into the lake. In order to save her, Pei Ziao had jumped into the lake as well. After the two of them had been rescued, she had recovered quickly, but Pei Ziao had fallen into a deep coma.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">To save Pei Ziao, she had started a bitter feud with her grandfather for the high-grade restorative pill, permanently distorting their relationship. She was very curious what would happen to Pei Ziao if she didn’t do so now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan rubbed her silver bracelet as she stepped towards the edge of the lake, intentionally giving Yun Ruoyao and Yi Qianying a chance to react.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As expected, she felt a sharp push from her back, and at the same time, she heard, “Ruoyan, be careful!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Quickly afterwards, she heard a splash as Pei Ziao jumped into the lake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan had planned to quickly escape into the pocket dimension of her bracelet as soon as she fell into the lake, but this time, after entering the lake, she noticed an unusual glimmer emanating from its bottom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan didn’t rush out of the lake; after all, she didn’t want to ruin her sisters’ dreams too quickly. Using the meager swimming ability she possessed, Yun Ruoyan swam towards the light at the bottom of the lake. It turned out to be a box, one which had clearly lain there for quite a while, its surface covered with an aquatic moss of some sort.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A weak light was emanating from the box.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan stretched out her hand, intending to take the box with her, but a large black fish suddenly swam out from her side. It looked almost as if it were glaring at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It seemed like a fish, but also not: there were no scales on its body, and a horn protruded from its forehead. In fact, it seemed more like a mystical creature of some sort.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan was so shocked by its sudden appearance that she quickly clutched her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The strange fish-creature swam a few circles around her before its gaze ended up on her silver bracelet. It swam a few more circles around her before turning to the box and arduously hitting it with the horn on its head until it popped open.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Inside was actually a legendary weapon!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan was astonished, because she had actually seen this weapon in the Yun family register, the legendary Feilai Blade that was protected by the mystical beast Jiao Lian.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">She hadn’t expected that it would actually be hidden at the bottom of this mountain lake!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Jiao Lian revolved around Yun Ruoyan a few more times before finally departing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan’s water-breathing technique wasn’t suitable for prolonged use, and it was almost time for her to return to the surface. Seeing Jiao Lian leave was the impetus for her to take the blade and return once more to the shore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Meanwhile, on the other side, Pei Ziao was still struggling in the water. Yun Ruoyao and Yi Qianying were clearly panicking, and they were shouting all around for help.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan temporarily stored the blade within her bracelet’s pocket dimension and swam over in Pei Ziao’s direction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Kehem! Ruoyan, Ruoyan!” Pei Ziao was choking on a few mouthfuls of water, and he struggled to even open his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Honestly, when she saw Pei Ziao behaving this way, she was briefly touched. But compared to the pain that Pei Ziao had brought her and the poison that he had forced down her throat, that brief moment was nothing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yun Ruoyan swam forward, clutched his waist, and dragged him ashore.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ruo, Ruoyan, you’re alright…?” As soon as he said that, Pei Ziao fainted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">By this time, a large crowd had gathered by the lake, and Yun Ruoyao and Yi Qianying were staring open-mouthed at the perfectly healthy Yun Ruoyan. Now that such a crowd had gathered, they couldn’t make any further moves against her! What’s more, how were they going to deal with Pei Ziao?!</span></p>
