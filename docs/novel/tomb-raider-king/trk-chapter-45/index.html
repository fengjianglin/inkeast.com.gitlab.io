<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The message was simple.</p> 
 <p>[Eat shit. Find someone else.]</p> 
 <p>That was the message that Yoo Jaeha wrote.</p> 
 <p>Honestly speaking, Yoo Jaeha’s heart was beating wildly.</p> 
 <p>Having the truth revealed and getting back his name and painting as an artist?</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha thought about that future for a moment. Thinking about that future gave him the chills as he saw a future where he was so happy he could die without any regrets.</p> 
 <p>It was to the point that even the non-religious Yoo Jaeha was willing to stupidly choose Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>However, at that moment…</p> 
 <p>‘Oops.’</p> 
 <p>He quickly snapped out of it and erased the message.</p> 
 <p>[Please let me know the time and place. There is something I must propose first.]</p> 
 <p>That was indeed the case.</p> 
 <p>‘Good. Did he say his name was Seo Ju-Heon? There’s no reason to completely trust this bastard.’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha barely managed to be rational.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, there was always the possibility. If it was possible for Ju-Heon to return his painting to him, Chairman Kwon might be able to do so as well.</p> 
 <p>‘So, I will keep it a secret from this bastard first, and then……’</p> 
 <p>However, Ju-Heon chuckled at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Are you done responding to Chairman Kwon?”<br> “Gasp!”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha's heart almost jumped out. He hid his cellphone behind him on reflex.</p> 
 <p>“R, responding to Chairman Kwon? What do you mean? I responded to my dongsaeng!”</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>‘What bullshit.’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon's hand moved at the speed of light. He then started to laugh in front of Yoo Jaeha.</p> 
 <p>“See, you did send it to Chairman Kwon.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha gasped. It was because Ju-Heon was looking at his phone while laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Crazy, when did he!”</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Give it back.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha then thought that his plan was ruined. Based on this bastard’s attitude, he might stab him with the knife right away after seeing the message.</p> 
 <p>However, Ju-Heon who saw the message was laughing too calmly.</p> 
 <p>"A proposal for Chairman Kwon? You're going to ask him to take care of Jean Richard and reveal the truth or something?”<br> “……Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon laughed toward the anxious Yoo Jaeha.</p> 
 <p>“Do whatever you want. You can do that if you want.”<br> “……!”</p> 
 <p>‘What is this bastard planning?’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon then threw something toward Yoo Jaeha.</p> 
 <p>[Marie Antoinette’s Necklace (B-Grade:Rare-Grade/Consumable Artifact)]</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Remaining Uses (1/10)</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>“Huh?”</p> 
 <p>It looked like a simple silver necklace. However, this was an artifact. That was why Yoo Jaeha looked toward Ju-Heon as if he didn’t understand.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon just waved at him.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, that is a small gift from me. Use it if Chairman Kwon makes you angry when you meet.”</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it.’</p> 
 <p>There was no way he could like this bastard who was acting like he knew everything, but Yoo Jaeha grabbed the mysterious necklace and turned around.</p> 
 <p>“You! Don’t regret this!”</p> 
 <p>However, Ju-Heon didn’t hold him back. </p> 
 <p>Why?</p> 
 <p>It was because Ju-Heon knew Yoo Jaeha and Chairman Kwon all too well.</p> 
 <p>He could already tell what was going to happen.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“Welcome. The Chairman-nim has been looking forward to meeting you.”</p> 
 <p>A meeting room somewhere in the middle of LA.</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon who had rented out an entire seminar room was waiting for Yoo Jaeha. Yoo Jaeha clenched onto the artifact Ju-Heon had given him before entering the room.</p> 
 <p>‘I don't know what artifact this is, but I probably won't need to use it.’</p> 
 <p>He then walked into the seminar room to see Chairman Kwon greeting him.</p> 
 <p>"Welcome. I've been waiting for you.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha hesitated before starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I will keep it short and get right to the point.”<br> “Haha, just what is it you are going to ask for that your shoulders are so stiff? Ask away. I will get you whatever you want.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha continued to swear internally.</p> 
 <p>‘I must totally be crazy, f*cking crazy.’</p> 
 <p>Honestly speaking, he didn't know if he was doing the right thing right now.</p> 
 <p>However, he saw a small ray of hope.</p> 
 <p>Even if it was just a lie to convince himself, Yoo Jaeha's actions were set now that his heart was already beating quickly.</p> 
 <p>That was how thirsty Yoo Jaeha was already. He was not at the point where he was willing to throw away his dreams.</p> 
 <p>“Sir, you are familiar with Jean Richard?”<br> “Jean Richard? Are you talking about the professor at Yale University? That genius artist?”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha started to grind his teeth. However, Chairman Kwon started to laugh without knowing what was on his mind.</p> 
 <p>“I know him well. He is a world-renowned painter. His unique style of painting he revealed not too long ago has given him the title of genius painter. They said he was the second coming of Picasso.”</p> 
 <p>‘The second coming of Picasso my ass.’</p> 
 <p>“Haha, sure. I heard that he was a respected mentor for all art students. Now that I think about it, you went to Yale for art too right? Was he one of your professors?”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha started to frown and got to the point.</p> 
 <p>“Please don't say something like that. That person stole my style of painting.”<br> “What?”<br> “He’s a thief who stole my work.”</p> 
 <p>The seminar room turned cold after that remark. Chairman Kwon had a terrible expression on his face while wondering what this punk was saying.</p> 
 <p>‘Now that I think about it, Richard’s style of painting had changed too quickly. I remember he said he was going to test out an artifact……’</p> 
 <p>That was indeed the case.</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon and Jean Richard had known each other in secret for a long time.</p> 
 <p>That wasn’t the only thing.</p> 
 <p>Richard was one of Chairman Kwon’s very important business partners. He was one of the core individuals of the business Chairman Kwon has been developing in secret.</p> 
 <p>He was one of the core individuals for &lt; Pandora &gt;.</p> 
 <p>It would not be wrong to say that the foundation of that business would falter if Richard was not there. That was why Chairman Kwon had paid special attention to get rid of any rumors surrounding Richard.</p> 
 <p>However, Yoo Jaeha who had no way of knowing that continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Please reveal that man’s wrongdoings. Then I will sign an exclusive contract with you.”</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to laugh as if it was unbelievable.</p> 
 <p>‘What did he just say?</p> 
 <p>Reveal Jean Richard's wrongdoings?</p> 
 <p>Is he telling me to ruin my business with my own hands?’</p> 
 <p>That was why the truth subconsciously came out.</p> 
 <p>“Are you crazy?”</p> 
 <p>He might have been honest because he had heard something so shocking.</p> 
 <p>“So you are insisting that Jean Richard is a plagiarist?”<br> “I am not insisting on anything, that is the truth and he is a plagiarist. I truly had my painting stolen.”<br> “Ho.”</p> 
 <p>‘This crazy bastard.’</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon could not speak anymore.</p> 
 <p>It was difficult to find a restorer so he was going to take this punk in because he happened to be one.</p> 
 <p>He never expected this punk to be a complete nutjob and a headache.</p> 
 <p>However, Chairman Kwon started to laugh as he responded.</p> 
 <p>“I understand. I don’t know the situation but I will thoroughly look into it. So please restore the artifacts first…”<br> “No. My conditions are that I will restore your artifacts once the truth has been revealed.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha was not an idiot. He needed to make the conditions clear if he did not want to be used. Chairman Kwon sighed and sent the secretary out before calling someone.</p> 
 <p>‘Who is he calling?’</p> 
 <p>However, Yoo Jaeha could not help but gasp after hearing the words that came out of Chairman Kwon's mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Ah. Richard? Do you know someone named Yoo Jaeha? There’s something I want to ask you.”<br> “!”</p> 
 <p>That was indeed the case. He was talking to Jean Richard.</p> 
 <p>‘This bastard!’</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon chatted with Jean Richard in French before putting the phone on speaker phone. Yoo Jaeha then started to hear him mock him in English.</p> 
 <p>[Yoo Jaeha, you retard. You should at least be smart if you have nothing.]</p> 
 <p>“!”</p> 
 <p>[Didn't I tell you last time? You might die without anybody knowing if you keep running your mouth.]</p> 
 <p>“……”</p> 
 <p>[I told you to live like a damn rat if you don't want to die. Are you really that dumb? I guess being buried in the art community wasn’t enough to make you come to your senses?]</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha's fists started to shake after hearing Jean Richard’s comments.</p> 
 <p>‘This motherf*cking bastard.’</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon then hung up the phone and started to speak as if he had made up his mind about something.</p> 
 <p>“I tried to help you out but I guess it won't work. You just speak nonsense and talk back to me.”</p> 
 <p>Whether the plagiarism was real or not, Richard would be buried if this information leaked. Any bad press could ruin his business.</p> 
 <p>‘I can't let anything about this leak out.’</p> 
 <p>He had no way of knowing what would happen if he let this bastard go. It was better to get rid of any potential dangers completely.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, it was obvious who he would choose if he had to choose between Yoo Jaeha who could somewhat handle a restoration artifact or Jean Richard, his friend.</p> 
 <p>‘It’ll be bad if Richard later found out that I hid something like this from him too.’</p> 
 <p>That was why Chairman Kwon’s plan was simple.</p> 
 <p>It was submission.</p> 
 <p>He had found Yoo Jaeha’s attitude that seemed to be testing the waters to be annoying anyway. Furthermore, the other person he was with before was Seo Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to grind his teeth.</p> 
 <p>“I think giving you a choice was the problem. Youngsters these days always do this when someone is nice to them. They try to be smart and take advantage of every situation. Such wicked bastards.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha looked toward Chairman Kwon in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>However, Chairman Kwon who could change attitudes quickly coldly continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, take your pick. Shut up and become my restorer, or… Be sued by a world-renowned artist and become completely buried.”<br> “!”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha looked at him as if he was ruined. However, Yoo Jaeha wasn’t very anxious.</p> 
 <p>Why?</p> 
 <p>The witty bastard had been recording everything on his phone from the moment he came to meet with Chairman Kwon.</p> 
 <p>‘It’ll be bad for TKBM if I leak this recording.’</p> 
 <p>However, Chairman Kwon started to laugh after seeing him being quiet.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think you're special because you are an artifact user?”</p> 
 <p>“!”</p> 
 <p>The guards that the secretary called over soon entered the room. The guards instantly suppressed Yoo Jaeha and took away his phone that was recording the conversation.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Let go of me!”<br> “A stupid dime-a-dozen artist dares to go against me?”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha became upset.</p> 
 <p>“What did you say? You stupid phone salesman bastard!”<br> “Haha. Sounds like something I've heard before. Lock him up and start with the mental training. Or we can shut you up here if you don’t want to do that.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha started to scream as soon as he saw Chairman Kwon take out an artifact.</p> 
 <p>He didn't know what it was, but it seemed extremely dangerous.</p> 
 <p>“F*ck!”</p> 
 <p>‘I might really die like this.’ Yoo Jaeha flailed as the guards slammed him down, but he could not overcome them.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>‘By the way, that is a small gift from me. Use it if Chairman Kwon makes you angry when you meet.’</p> 
 <p>He suddenly recalled Ju-Heon’s words. Yoo Jaeha then used the artifact Ju-Heon gave him.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it, why is nothing happening?!’</p> 
 <p>Did that bastard scam him?</p> 
 <p>‘This bastard, did he give me a useless item as a gift?!’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha grinded his teeth as they captured him.</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it, you motherf*cking bastard!</p> 
 <p>Dream, my ass!’</p> 
 <p>He had thought he was worth something because of that bastard.</p> 
 <p>He should have just lowered his head and thought about ways to make money as he had done in the past.</p> 
 <p>It wasn't like he didn't know who he could press and who he couldn't press. Yoo Jaeha started to cry in fear.</p> 
 <p>“Aigoo! People really can’t to do things they don't normally do!”</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“But there are things that can change because of that as well.”</p> 
 <p>Bang!</p> 
 <p>The seminar room’s door was slammed open. Both Yoo Jaeha and Chairman Kwon became shocked after seeing who ran into the seminar room.</p> 
 <p>The person who appeared like a savior was Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon gasped in shock as soon as he saw Ju-Heon’s face.</p> 
 <p>‘How did this bastard?!</p> 
 <p>There should be guards outside to prevent Yoo Jaeha from running away!’</p> 
 <p>However, Ju-Heon who had knocked all of them out on his way here was sneering at him. Yoo Jaeha started to shout as soon as he saw Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>“You!”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon who looked at Yoo Jaeha and Chairman Kwon started to laugh as if he knew it would go down like this. Ju-Heon then calmly asked his former subordinate whom he cherished.</p> 
 <p>"Alright then, really make your decision now. Will you be that bastard's slave forever or will you become my subordinate, restore your name, and get out of here?”</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it.’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha closed his eyes as if he was both relieved and angry.</p> 
 <p>This bastard really was the devil.</p> 
 <p>‘The answer is obvious!’</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know what this bastard was planning to do from here on, but he wasn’t going to waste his time plotting things anymore.</p> 
 <p>He was the only person who was willing to help him get his painting back in the first place.</p> 
 <p>That fact alone made him very happy. Furthermore, he had no choice but to trust him in the current situation.</p> 
 <p>“Fine! You, I choose you! I'll be your exclusive subordinate! Take my kidney, my gallbladder, take everything, you bastard!”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon started to smile wickedly at that response.</p> 
 <p>‘Punk. You should have said that from the start. Took you long enough to listen.’</p> 
 <p>That was how Yoo Jaeha became a restoration slave, no, no, once again became a member of Ju-Heon's tomb raiding team.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon activated an artifact at the same time.</p>
