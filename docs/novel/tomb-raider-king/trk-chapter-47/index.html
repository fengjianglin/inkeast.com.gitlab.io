 <p><br></p>
 <p>‘Damn it, why did it have to!’</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha almost instantly regretted deciding to work for Ju-Heon. It made sense since this was Irene Holten!</p>
 <p>He was already on the run from that household, so just what!</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha who became anxious could not help himself as he started to shout and spit.</p>
 <p>“Hey! I mean, President-nim! How are you, I mean, sir, how are you connected to the Holten household?”</p>
 <p>He was so shocked that he could not speak properly. However, Ju-Heon just snorted while looking at Irene.</p>
 <p>‘How do I know her?’</p>
 <p>“That woman chased me down.”<br>“What?!”</p>
 <p>‘Why would that woman who is not lacking anything! Why would she want a thug like you?!’</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha who could not say that out loud could only sigh.</p>
 <p>Technically, what Yoo Jaeha could not understand was not a lie. She chased him down saying she wanted to get rid of her curse. Ju-Heon’s strong arm did not let go of Yoo Jaeha's collar as he needed Jaeha to do just that.</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha who could not run away because he was much weaker than Ju-Heon could only go crazy.</p>
 <p>The fact that Irene was there meant that they might know that he was alive. That was why Yoo Jaeha's ass was on fire as he thought about George Holten, the person he scammed.</p>
 <p>‘Damn it, that man might hire a hitman to kill me if he finds out!’</p>
 <p>He would not show such a reaction if the Holten household was a regular wealthy household. But what kind of family were they?</p>
 <p>They loved their youngest daughter, Irene Holten so much to the point that they would hire a hitman or use their influence to destroy someone for three generations and follow them to the end of the earth if they harmed her even ever so slightly.</p>
 <p>It was bound to be exaggerated as it was a rumor, but it was obvious what kind of family they were.</p>
 <p>He had only considered scamming them because of the power of his artifact.</p>
 <p>‘Damn it, I barely managed to create a corpse with the artifact to trick them!’</p>
 <p>That was not the only problem.</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha suddenly started to get a stomachache as Irene got closer. Of course, there were people nearby saying things like, ‘Huh? My wallet!’ But Ju-Heon did not care at all.</p>
 <p>He just calmly continued to think.</p>
 <p>‘Yoo Jaeha is a future Monarch as well so he shouldn't die while being next to the Monarch of Destitution.’</p>
 <p>Well, any stocks this punk has bought might all sink but he did not care about that. Furthermore, even if artifacts became destroyed, this punk would just restore them.</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha started to go wild as Irene got closer.</p>
 <p>“President-nim, let me go. Please let me go!”<br>“Why should I?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha pinched Ju-Heon’s hand that was holding him but it was useless as Irene was now right in front of Yoo Jaeha.</p>
 <p>The future Monarch of Fraud and the Monarch of Destitution had met.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon who saw Irene greeted her.</p>
 <p>“You’re here?”<br>“Yes, I came because you said you can get rid of my curse!”</p>
 <p>She seemed extremely happy. Her eyes that curled up like a crescent moon were so beautiful that people couldn't help but fall for her, but Yoo Jaeha just saw her as a potential goddess of disaster.</p>
 <p>However, Yoo Jaeha who was flailing suddenly remembered something.</p>
 <p>‘No, wait! The person I scammed was George Holten. It wasn’t this woman.’</p>
 <p>Although he had scammed her family, he had not seen this woman.</p>
 <p>‘If I'm lucky, she might not know who I am.’</p>
 <p>Just like how Asians were bad at telling white people apart, white people thought all Asians looked similar. She might not recognize him.</p>
 <p>That was why Yoo Jaeha shamelessly put his hand forward with high expectations.</p>
 <p>“Ah, nice to meet you. My name is Leonardo Kang.”</p>
 <p>However, this was how Irene responded to him.</p>
 <p>“Ah. That scammer.”</p>
 <p>‘Damn it.’</p>
 <p>It truly seemed as if it would not be possible to trick her.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha had his head down.</p>
 <p>He had a terrible stomachache and headache, but he held it in. He could only keep his head down as if he was asking her to let him live.</p>
 <p>He had a single request.</p>
 <p>“Please keep it a secret with your brother.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon started to laugh at that request.</p>
 <p>‘This stupid idiot.</p>
 <p>That’s why you shouldn't have scammed them.’</p>
 <p>“Just how much did you scam them for?”<br>“70 million dollars (80 billion won).”</p>
 <p>It was a lot of money.</p>
 <p>“Then you should be fine if you return the money you took.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha clenched his eyes.</p>
 <p>‘I wouldn't be doing this if I had any of that money left!’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon scoffed at Jaeha who could not respond.</p>
 <p>He could bet all of his money on the fact that Jaeha probably lost it all while gambling.</p>
 <p>“How much do you have left?”<br>“5…50.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon started to laugh as if Jaeha was a good boy.</p>
 <p>“50 billon? Oh, you still have a lot more than I expected.”<br>“No, 50 million won…”</p>
 <p>‘As I expected.’</p>
 <p>This wonderful subordinate of his had lived up to his expectations.</p>
 <p>He just didn't know what kind of magic turned 80 billion to 50 million won. <span id="footnote-ref-d1a3"><a href="#footnote-d1a3">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>‘It’s understandable. This punk has no luck with gambling.’</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha sniffled without being able to raise his head.</p>
 <p>“Please don't kill me.”</p>
 <p>The future Monarch of Fraud was kneeling in front of the Monarch of Destitution with his head down. That was so funny Ju-Heon was laughing internally.</p>
 <p>But Irene smiled bitterly while looking at Yoo Jaeha. Irene had heard what was going on from Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>She had also heard that Yoo Jaeha would help her get rid of her curse. That was why Irene had no plans on harming Yoo Jaeha.</p>
 <p>It was bad that he scammed her brother, but she could consider 80 billion dollars as payment for getting rid of her curse.</p>
 <p>‘He also looks like he's become Mr. Ju-Heon’s employee now.’</p>
 <p>He might be trustworthy now.</p>
 <p>Her brother George Holten would probably let things go if he helped her get rid of her curse as well. That was how hard he had been trying to get rid of his younger sister’s curse. Of course, he would probably chase after Yoo Jaeha to blow his head off right now if he knew that he was alive.</p>
 <p>That was why Irene was about to tell him to raise his head.</p>
 <p>“Umm…”</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon stopped her at that moment.</p>
 <p>“?”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon raised his finger to his mouth to tell her to be quiet as Irene looked toward him in confusion. He knew what she was going to say.</p>
 <p>‘I'm sure she's going to say she'll forgive him because he’ll help her with her curse.’</p>
 <p>But Ju-Heon thought this was a great whip to educate Yoo Jaeha. Jaeha wasn't that much of a sincere person, so Ju-Heon had no way of knowing whether he would work efficiently even if he put him to work.</p>
 <p>Jaeha was someone who might slack off so much to the point of taking over a year to restore a single artifact even if Ju-Heon imprisoned him and forced him to work.</p>
 <p>Irene was a great whip.</p>
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon whispered something to Irene. Irene nodded her head in agreement and started to speak to Yoo Jaeha.</p>
 <p>“Umm, Mr. Yoo Jaeha, you probably would not be safe if I told my brother about this.”<br>“Aigoo, yes I know. I know very well.”<br>“Mr. Yoo Jaeha, I will keep the fact that you are alive a secret from my brother. In return…”<br>“I, in return?”<br>“You have to agree to my request.”<br>“A request?”</p>
 <p>Irene looked toward Ju-Heon and continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“This sir is my important business partner. There’s something I commissioned him to do, and he needs his artifacts restored quickly to take care of my request.”</p>
 <p>She was saying don't slack off and quickly restore the artifacts.</p>
 <p>“I will give you 3 days for the ten artifacts.”<br>“E, excuse me?!”</p>
 <p>‘Three days for 10 artifacts?</p>
 <p>Is she crazy?!’</p>
 <p>This was not possible. Artifact restoration took a lot of time. It took a lot of finesse.</p>
 <p>Buildings such as the Sungnyemun took years to restore. Of course, artifact restoration could not be compared to buildings and each artifact was different, but it still took at least a week to restore an artifact even if he gave it everything he had.</p>
 <p>But she was giving him three days for all ten artifacts?</p>
 <p>It was like asking him to develop an MMORPG game in three days!</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha teared up and started to beg to Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>“President-nim! Three days is not possible. I need at least one week per each one!”</p>
 <p>Then was he asking for around two months for 10 of them?</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon scoffed at his comments.</p>
 <p>"Fine, I’ll go easy on you. One week for all ten of them. I can’t give you any longer than that.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha clenched his eyes shut. ‘I told you I need at least a week per artifact, not a week for 10!’</p>
 <p>“Damn it, I said I need a week per artifact! Furthermore, the president-nim……!”<br>“Captain instead of president.”</p>
 <p>Captain?<br>He didn't know why Ju-Heon wanted to be addressed that way, but Yoo Jaeha started to speak again.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, the artifacts the captain-nim brought are all artifacts on the brink of destruction! It might even take a few weeks for each one!”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha started to pound his chest as if he was about to die from frustration. He could only sigh as he could not say that this was why experts like him could not speak to laypeople like them.</p>
 <p>‘This is why the people who know nothing are the problem.’</p>
 <p>“Excuse me. Captain-nim. I understand you might not know much about the restoration work, but ten in one week really is not possible.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon scoffed at his comments.</p>
 <p>‘Who doesn’t know about restoration?’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon had the ancient art, physics, and chemistry knowledge required for restoration. That was how he had used the restore ability given by his Archaeologist's artifact to restore artifacts in the past.</p>
 <p>“My knowledge of artifact restoration is a level above yours. You idiot. One week is plenty to restore 10 artifacts.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha whose pride was hurt glared at Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>“Your artifact restoration knowledge is a level above mine?”</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, that was the truth.</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha was extremely talented, but he was still just a baby chick.</p>
 <p>That was why it was obvious that Ju-Heon who had a lot of knowledge about artifacts would be a level higher.</p>
 <p>However, Yoo Jaeha who had no way of knowing that pounded his chest as if he was eating dry food without any water.</p>
 <p>‘Aigoo, anybody can say that they can restore artifacts!’</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha then shouted in anger.</p>
 <p>"Then Captain-nim! Please explain the process of restoration to me if you are that confident! Let me at least hear how much you know!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon started to smile wickedly in response.</p>
 <p>"Fine, however, if you agree that I know more about it than you do, I will decrease the time from one week to one day. You have no complaints, right?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha flinched at the possibility of falling into hell if he lost but confidently accepted the condition.</p>
 <p>There was no way a layperson could explain it in a way that he would accept.</p>
 <p>“Yes sir! Whatever you want!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon smiled at his response.</p>
 <p>‘Yoo Jaeha, you witty bastard.</p>
 <p>You're dead.’</p>
