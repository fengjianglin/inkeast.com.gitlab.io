 <p></p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon chuckled.</p> 
 <p>‘The Monarch of Fraud. I must find that bastard.’</p> 
 <p>Artifacts were not permanent. That was obvious for the &lt; Consumable Artifacts &gt; with limited amounts of uses, but even &lt; Possession Artifacts &gt; that didn't have such limits would be destroyed if a person abused them or they received significant damage.</p> 
 <p>That was why it was only natural for there to be artifact restorers similar to art restorers in the world. They were people who restored artifacts using other artifacts.</p> 
 <p>‘But restorers are rare because it is difficult to handle restoration artifacts.’</p> 
 <p>Of course, not all of those restorers were at the same level.</p> 
 <p>Even good restorers could not restore completely consumed durability or revive completely destroyed artifacts.</p> 
 <p>‘Even high-grade restorers can only patch up or put an oxygen-mask on them.’</p> 
 <p>However, there was a restorer who was at the level of performing miracles like some religious leaders and could completely restore artifacts and make them new. That bastard was someone who was more talented than the personal restorers of monopolizers.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon had the restore ability provided by his Archaeologist’s artifact, but it was only at the level of regular emergency care.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, the restore ability had not been awakened yet in this life.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore…</p> 
 <p>‘I hate the art-type artifacts used in restoration.’</p> 
 <p>Why?</p> 
 <p>Art-type artifacts or other artifacts of the arts that were mainly used for restoration required significant affinity levels. Not anybody could use them because someone who forcefully dominated an artifact could not understand the artistic mindset. It was some nonsense like that, but that was why Ju-Heon didn’t mesh well with them. Furthermore, you needed art and chemistry knowledge to restore artifacts.</p> 
 <p>‘I'd rather go find another artifact than become friendly with a restoration artifact or study.’</p> 
 <p>That was why he needed to find Yoo Jaeha.</p> 
 <p>He should be about 26 years old at this time.</p> 
 <p>That punk was also one of Ju-Heon’s tomb raiding team members. He used to be one of the monopolizers until he was absorbed into Chairman Kwon’s team. That bastard was responsible for all of Chairman Kwon's artifacts, and his scam-like restoration abilities helped to raise Chairman Kwon to the highest spot.</p> 
 <p>‘I need to either take away his artifact or make him my slave.’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha. ‘See what happens if I catch you.’<br> Ju-Heon then smiled wickedly as he set a location to meet with Irene.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>[Everyone, please do not be shocked. There are items with magical powers in this world.]<br> [These items are so magical that it is unbelievable they exist in this world.]<br> [It has been determined that the phenomenon that struck the entire world recently was similar to the odd tombs that have randomly appeared in the world before that.]<br> [Will this resolve the nine month long mystery of the tombs that we have not been able to solve until now?]<br> [Scholars have started to actively research this phenomenon……]</p> 
 <p>“Damn it!”</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon was grinding his teeth while listening to the information coming out of the TV. The man who was resting while wrapped up like a mummy at the hospital was boiling inside.</p> 
 <p>Isn't it obvious why?</p> 
 <p>The information about the artifacts that he had tried so hard to keep a secret had been revealed to the world. This was such a big issue that marketing around this could have landed someone in the Guinness Book of Records.</p> 
 <p>Next to him was another old man laughing and mocking Chairman Kwon.</p> 
 <p>“What happened to you?”</p> 
 <p>It was an old man named Edward who had come to visit the healing Chairman Kwon.</p> 
 <p>“You're a total mess, Chairman Kwon.”</p> 
 <p>This English old man, age 67 years old, who was laughing so loudly was a world renowned weapons and information merchant. This old man who used to be a secret agent but disappeared into the underworld after racking up infamy was Chairman Kwon’s middleman.</p> 
 <p>He was the person responsible for selling the artifacts Chairman Kwon gathered to other nation's governments or colossus for a hefty sum.</p> 
 <p>However, Chairman Kwon didn't care whether Edward was a colossus of the underworld or not as he continued to grind his teeth while looking at Edward.</p> 
 <p>“You’re laughing at it because it’s someone else’s business.”</p> 
 <p>Edward started laughing slower as if telling him not to be like that.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations. All of the clients were angry after hearing that you were the person responsible for this Great Tomb Appearance. They want to know why you are going around causing trouble.”</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon felt his blood pressure rise and almost went crazy.</p> 
 <p>‘Was this old bastard crazy?!’</p> 
 <p>“Why would you tell them that?!”</p> 
 <p>Of course, Chairman Kwon had explained the situation to this old bastard when he woke up in the hospital yesterday.</p> 
 <p>It was because he thought that Edward might know something about the crow that he saw.</p> 
 <p>“But why the hell did you have to spread the news about the Great Tomb Appearance as well?!”</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it, my credibility!’</p> 
 <p>However, Edward continued to laugh as if he was trying to add illness as a result of anger to Chairman Kwon's list of issues.</p> 
 <p>The person who was the most upset about the fact that Chairman Kwon's mistake led to the Great Tomb Appearance and revealed the existence of artifacts was none other than Edward.</p> 
 <p>‘The blue ocean that I managed to find has turned into a mud puddle.’</p> 
 <p>Well, it didn't really matter to him. He had already solidified his footing.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>‘It’s rare to find someone like Chairman Kwon who can procure good artifacts.’</p> 
 <p>But Chairman Kwon was in this state right now.</p> 
 <p>It was a pity, Edward found this to be such a pity. Where could he find someone even better than Chairman Kwon?</p> 
 <p>‘Did he say it was someone named Seo Ju-Heon who had made him like this?’</p> 
 <p>Edward started to smile as if he was greedy for Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>Wouldn't he be an even better partner than Chairman Kwon?</p> 
 <p>‘It’ll take Chairman Kwon a while to get discharged anyway.’</p> 
 <p>“It doesn’t look like Lee Jin-A or Yoon Shi Woo who work for you can do anything right now either. I’ll be on my way then.”</p> 
 <p>The secretary became anxious after seeing him get up as if he had no business here.</p> 
 <p>It was because she knew very well that he was Chairman Kwon’s business partner and the person helping Chairman Kwon increase his artifact business.</p> 
 <p>“One moment please! Chairman-nim!”</p> 
 <p>However, Edward smiled as he responded.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, don't worry. I’ll come to visit again soon. Why don't you find him a good healing artifact for the time being. Ah right! Get that fancy conquest artifact restored as well.”<br> “What? Restored?”<br> “Yes, there are artifacts that can restore other artifacts. Well, they are hard to handle so there are only a few people who can use them though.”</p> 
 <p>Chairman Kwon's expression immediately changed.</p> 
 <p>“Can you introduce me to someone?”<br> “Hmm, unfortunately, I knew just one person but I've lost contact with him. All I have is his name.”<br> “What is his name?”<br> “Yoo Jaeha.”</p> 
 <p>Edward said that before leaving Chairman Kwon’s hospital room. Chairman Kwon's gaze changed after hearing about that. He then urgently started to speak to his secretary.</p> 
 <p>"Find that Yoo Jaeha no matter what it takes. Search the whole world if you have to do so.”</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“Damn, is it really okay to meet Irene like this, hyung-nim?”</p> 
 <p>Oh Seung Woo was looking at Ju-Heon as if he could not understand him. They were in Henderson, a city in Nevada around Las Vegas. They were supposed to meet Irene here. However, Ju-Heon laughed while looking at the concerned Oh Seung Woo group.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the problem? We’re just meeting a woman.”</p> 
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group started to shake in fear.</p> 
 <p>“S, she’s not just any woman! She’s a celebrity, a mesmerizing beauty, and ………”</p> 
 <p>She was a woman that made them ill whenever they were around her. The Oh Seung Woo group seemed to be unable to forget that pain as they shook in fear, but Ju-Heon just calmly smiled.</p> 
 <p>‘You punks are the ones who are in harm’s way by being around her.’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon had the Tolerance skill so he wouldn't be impacted as much as the guys. Of course, his Tolerance skill was not that high in level, so he did receive some damage but it was minor and recovered after resting for a bit.</p> 
 <p>“But hyung-nim, according to what you said, that woman is someone who walks around causing disasters. Won't being close to her just destroy yoru artifacts even more?”<br> “Just who is this Yoo Jaeha bastard?”</p> 
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group had heard some information about artifacts from Ju-Heon as Ju-Heon believed the time was right. Although they didn't understand well, they at least understood that artifacts were items that were helpful to Ju-Heon. That was why they thought it would be best to go grab more artifacts as quickly as possible.</p> 
 <p>But he was going to go meet with Irene?<br> Ju-Heon who knew what the Oh Seung Woo group was worried about started to laugh.</p> 
 <p>“That is why I left the Consumable Artifacts in the safe deposit box. They won’t break that way.”</p> 
 <p>And then…</p> 
 <p>“Yoo Jaeha and that woman have some connection as well.”<br> “Excuse me?”<br> “We need that bastard to tell her how to get rid of her curse. It’s killing two birds with one stone.”<br> “Is it impossible to tell her without that bastard?”<br> “I can tell her, but…”<br> “But?”<br> “I'm terrible at explanations.”<br> “?”</p> 
 <p>That was indeed the case. Of course, Ju-Heon wasn’t planning on ignoring Irene as he had received the Herb of Eternal Youth. He obviously had a decent idea about how to get rid of her curse. However, that method might be a bit painful for Irene, and chances were high that she wouldn't understand even if Ju-Heon explained it to her.</p> 
 <p>It would be like handing down the know-how to her.</p> 
 <p>‘Well, might as well take everything I can here and there before telling her.”</p> 
 <p>It happened at that moment.</p> 
 <p>"Damn it, why is that woman still not here?”</p> 
 <p>As the men started to grumble…</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon and Oh Seung Woo heard a loud noise above their heads.</p> 
 <p>Du du du du du du du du.</p> 
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group who looked up dropped their jaws in shock. There was a helicopter above their heads. She had said she’ll come right over as she was in a nearby city, but they had never expected her to come on a personal helicopter.</p> 
 <p>Irene who soon got off on the nearby helipad ran over with a bright smile on her face.</p> 
 <p>“I'm sorry for making you wait! Umm, this isn’t much but please take it as a thank you gift for quickly figure out a method!”</p> 
 <p>Irene who ran over handed over a paper bag. The Oh Seung Woo group who saw the paper bag gasped.</p> 
 <p>It was a shopping bag from a luxury goods store.</p> 
 <p>She was talking quickly in English so they couldn’t understand her, but it seemed as if Irene had brought a gift to thank Ju-Heon. It was bound to be some expensive male luxury item.</p> 
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group’s eyes flipped over temporarily as Ju-Heon declined the gift and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Please keep that for me. May I ask something first?”<br> “E, excuse me?”<br> “Is there anybody around you who is interested in purchasing art?”<br> “Ah, there is someone. My older brother…”<br> “Perfect. I am looking for someone. This is what he looks like, could you ask your brother…”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon handed a picture he seemed to have downloaded from the internet. It seemed like a picture from a graduation exhibition, and although the person's face was small, it was enough to tell his appearance.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know if your brother might know him, but…”</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? This person!”</p> 
 <p>Surprisingly, Irene seemed to notice the person.</p> 
 <p>However, Irene's expression as she looked at Yoo Jaeha's face was odd.</p>
