<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p></p> 
 <p>She was a third year middle school student this year.</p> 
 <p>Sasaki who was at that age where she could get a heart attack by just looking at men was really shocked after looking at Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>He seemed to be in his early twenties. Although he was sitting down, she could tell that he was tall, and he was neither too skinny like an anchovy or fat.</p> 
 <p>Of course, he had a simple dandy cut and was just wearing a black turtleneck shirt and jeans.</p> 
 <p>He was dressed like a regular person compared to her favorite idol, Sosuke.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>‘Kya! He's perfect! Ikemen! <span id="footnote-ref-2c58"><a href="#footnote-2c58">[1]</a></span> He’s so handsome!’</p> 
 <p>Rather than the clothes making the person, the person was making the clothes look good in this situation. His facial features gave him a manly look while giving off the vibe that would look great on TV.</p> 
 <p>‘Kya, he’s the best! He gives off the wealthy young master vibe! He's a total prince charming!’</p> 
 <p>Of course, this was all just Sasaki’s imagination.</p> 
 <p>Forget a prince, this tomb raider was someone who wouldn’t even go easy on women if they were his enemy.</p> 
 <p>Although it was true that Ju-Heon was quite handsome, the problem was that although the outside was perfect, the inside was not the ideal man Sasaki was looking for.</p> 
 <p>And lo and behold.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon was smiling with murderous intent as he looked at Sasaki.</p> 
 <p>‘The Future Diary is here.’</p> 
 <p>She seemed to have tried her best to disguise herself as an employee, but Ju-Heon was familiar with Sasaki’s face. Of course, this was the first time he had seen her up close and Sasaki was actually quite a cute girl.</p> 
 <p>Well……</p> 
 <p>‘At least she would be if she didn’t use so much makeup.’</p> 
 <p>She wasn’t at the level of a gyaru, but she definitely looked like a troublemaker.</p> 
 <p>Her hair that was loosely tied on both sides was dyed bright while her accessories and make-up looked like something straight out of a fashion magazine for teens.</p> 
 <p>He had no idea why she was so greedy with the amount of eyeliner she used and put fake lashes that were thicker than her hair when her face wasn’t bad to start.</p> 
 <p>‘Well, her appearance isn't important.’</p> 
 <p>He was planning on getting rid of her anyway.</p> 
 <p>He preferred not to kill for no reason, but Sasaki was Ju-Heon's enemy because of the Future Diary.<br> It'd be one thing if she handed the Future Diary to him, but there was no way a Japanese informant would do that.</p> 
 <p>That was why he would get rid of her with Muramasa.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon placed his hand on Muramasa. A JSDF soldier who noticed that quickly put his hand on his gun inside his pocket.</p> 
 <p>‘Did Sasaki somehow get found out?’</p> 
 <p>He didn’t plan on killing a foreigner in the middle of the city, but it was different if he picked up the sword first.</p> 
 <p>However, Ju-Heon was smiling.</p> 
 <p>‘Let’s see how you act.’</p> 
 <p>He already knew that JSDF soldiers were disguised as employees. They seemed to have tried hard to disguise themselves, but it was useless.</p> 
 <p>‘It’s obvious, you idiots.’</p> 
 <p>There was no way someone like Ju-Heon who was familiar with places where people died would be unable to tell the difference between the soldiers who had murderous intent and regular civilians.</p> 
 <p>‘I already checked all of them earlier.’</p> 
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon had already done something in preparation.</p> 
 <p>And then, as Ju-Heon was about to take Muramasa out…</p> 
 <p>“Onii-san, can I be your fan?”</p> 
 <p>An unexpected situation happened.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Silence filled the room for a moment.</p> 
 <p>Both Ju-Heon and the JSDF soldiers outside flinched at Sasaki's unexpected comment.</p> 
 <p>They all questioned their ears for a moment. Then they started to think.</p> 
 <p>‘What could this be? Is this the JSDF bastards’ plan?’</p> 
 <p>That was what Ju-Heon was thinking as he started to frown.</p> 
 <p>‘What? Did Colonel Mouri give her a separate order?’<br> ‘What the hell is going on? Is this part of the plan? Did the Future Diary tell her to do this?’</p> 
 <p>The JSDF soldiers were in a state of chaos.</p> 
 <p>The first person to speak was Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>“What did you just say?”</p> 
 <p>He sounded slightly annoyed. That made Sasaki start to speak again as if she realized what she said was not right either.</p> 
 <p>“No, that's not it……”</p> 
 <p>Sasaki peeked around for a moment before closing the sliding door.</p> 
 <p>The soldiers hiding outside were shocked at this action.</p> 
 <p>‘Sasaki, what are you doing!’<br> ‘Why did you close the door?!’<br> ‘We can’t see anything!’</p> 
 <p>They were all looking from the kitchen, among the tables, different areas around the restaurant. They could only chat amongst themselves now that they couldn’t see anything.</p> 
 <p>"What is going on? Have you heard anything about this, sir?”<br> “Do you think it is Colonel Mouri’s orders?”<br> “Shall we barge in?”</p> 
 <p>They all debated for a moment before coming to a decision.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s wait and see. It could be a plan to seduce that Korean. Sasaki is a proud Japanese citizen after all. I'm sure she is thinking about the country. She must be doing this because she knows that there will be a lot of damage if we cause a scene here.”<br> “I, I guess Sasaki is indeed the saintess who will save our country.”</p> 
 <p>Yes. No matter how she looked, she was the Future Diary artifact user who was representing the country.</p> 
 <p>They should trust her.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, they were making a terrible mistake.</p> 
 <p>Forget making a plan to save the country…</p> 
 <p>Sasaki just wanted to get Ju-Heon's number. The reason she closed the door was because the soldiers would get in her way. </p> 
 <p>And lo and behold.</p> 
 <p>“Can you please give me your number?”</p> 
 <p>Sasaki handed Ju-Heon her phone with sparkling eyes once they were alone.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon was about to pick up Muramasa because he was annoyed before flinching at what he saw on Sasaki’s screen.<br> All sorts of images Ju-Heon could never expect was on there.</p> 
 <p>[~~~(TдT) Kya, handsome onii-san↗. Fell for you at first sight. ★ I am the Future Diary user. (⋈◍＞◡＜◍)。✧♡ -&gt; I want to get to know you better. ٩(♡ε♡ )۶ =Do you have a girlfriend?(｡･ω･｡)ﾉ?]</p> 
 <p>The text had no Kanji and was full of emoticons and shortened phrases mainly used by girls as they text.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon started to contemplate hard. He was thinking that nobody could be this stupid. He had met all sorts of Japanese people while exploring tombs but he had never met someone like this before.</p> 
 <p>‘What the hell could she be thinking?‘</p> 
 <p>She even revealed her true identity to him.</p> 
 <p>Was it an act?</p> 
 <p>Could that be it? Was she going to pretend to be friendly before stabbing him in the back?</p> 
 <p>‘Or was there a different future?’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon knew a lot about the Future Diary. The things it said should be similar to what he imagined.</p> 
 <p>Sasaki started to get nervous as Ju-Heon just stared at her.</p> 
 <p>She seemed to have realized something because she started to type on her phone again. She then handed it to Ju-Heon.</p> 
 <p>[I fol in love. I Futrue see. (´；ω；`) Yu and I frend. A u Ok? And…… Glis frend iru? ?｡( ；∀ ；)]</p> 
 <p>“………”</p> 
 <p>She seemed to have thought she was using English because she realized Ju-Heon was a foreigner. </p> 
 <p>But it just gave Ju-Heon a headache.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon wanted to rip the text apart and give her English composition lessons but it was fine.</p> 
 <p>He understood what she wanted.</p> 
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon took the phone and wrote something before showing it to Sasaki.</p> 
 <p>Sasaki’s face lit up after seeing the response.</p> 
 <p>Something happened at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Clang! Bang!</p> 
 <p>“Kyaaaaa! Why did the table suddenly?!”</p> 
 <p>The loud noise distracted the JSDF soldiers outside. They turned their heads to see customers who were shocked that their table suddenly flipped over.</p> 
 <p>It happened at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! Sasaki!”</p> 
 <p>They saw Ju-Heon and Sasaki. Ju-Heon and Sasaki had run away from the restaurant during the chaos.</p> 
 <p>That made the soldiers drop their jaws in shock.</p> 
 <p>“T, those punks!”<br> “Chase them right now!”<br> “You can kill the male!”<br> “Yes sir!”</p> 
 <p>However, it was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon who seemed to be smiling at the soldiers mumbled something. The soldiers suddenly screamed as they fell.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>Something tripped the soldiers before starting to bind them.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhh! What is this?!”</p> 
 <p>That was the rope that Ju-Heon had stealthily released in the restaurant. The rope that had been slithering around the restaurant like a snake had flipped the table over earlier before getting excited and tying the soldiers up. It was moving extremely fast.</p> 
 <p>The soldiers who were tied up around their chest and legs as if they were enjoying some BDSM rope harness started to scream.</p> 
 <p>“What is this?!”<br> “Damn it, let go of me! Let me go!”<br> “Chase them! We're all dead if we let them escape!”<br> “But! T, this weird rope!”<br> “Damn it, Sasakiiiiiii!”<br> “L, locate them first! We have a tracker on her!”<br> “But I can’t use my h, hand because I am tied up……!”<br> “This is bad! We can’t even cut this with the sashimi knife!”<br> “Then contact headquarters first! Give them information on the male!”<br> “I unders……m, mmph!”<br> “Damn it, this damn rope bastard is covering his mouth! Cut this first! Hurry…. Mmph!”</p> 
 <p>However, the rope who was given orders by Ju-Heon tied the male soldiers up even tighter as they flailed around.</p> 
 <p>I caught a big fish, I caught a big fish!</p> 
 <p>The only thing the soldiers could do was scream after being tied up by the excited Sun and Moon rope.</p> 
 <p>They ended up becoming the entertainment for people who stopped by and took pictures.</p> 
 <p>It would not be long before these pictures went viral on the internet.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Sasaki was extremely happy.</p> 
 <p>[Then do you want to flee with this onii-san for a bit in the name of love?]</p> 
 <p>She never expected to get such a response.</p> 
 <p>Sasaki started to blush after seeing Ju-Heon lead her to an alley without many people.</p> 
 <p>Weren’t they moving too fast to come to such a secluded place to start?</p> 
 <p>‘Hehe, I don’t know. I finally got to come out so I’ll just play around until the old misters show up and then go home.’</p> 
 <p>When else would she get a chance like this?</p> 
 <p>And then…</p> 
 <p>‘I have the advantage because I already marked him.’</p> 
 <p>She had a wicked smile on her face.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon also seemed to have artifacts on him but they wouldn't be able to affect her Future Diary.</p> 
 <p>If all else fails, she could use the Future Diary to make a deal with him or escape. This onii-san would probably give her everything she wanted for the Future Diary just like Sosuke and the Japanese government had done.</p> 
 <p>However, she needed to quickly realize something. She needed to understand that the person in front of her was not an easy prey.</p> 
 <p>“Umm, onii-san. What is your name? How old are you? Do you know who Nakamura Sosuke is? What is your favorite food……kya!”</p> 
 <p>Sasaki screamed.</p> 
 <p>Crack!</p> 
 <p>It was because her cellphone that was in Ju-Heon's hand broke.</p> 
 <p>“Kyaaaa! My phone!”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon ruthlessly destroyed Sasaki’s phone. It was because he needed to destroy the tracker and the GPS on the phone.</p> 
 <p>However, Sasaki started to cry as she had no way of knowing that was his reason.</p> 
 <p>“Waaaa! Why did you do that! That phone had a voicemail from Sosuke saved on it! Negotiate right now! The JSDF misters will follow the tracker here and will make you negotiate right away!”</p> 
 <p>She cried and started to complain but she could not help but shut up.</p> 
 <p>“Gasp!”</p> 
 <p>A sharp blade was touching her neck.</p> 
 <p>It was Muramasa.</p> 
 <p>Sasaki plopped down on the ground and Ju-Heon smiled as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You mean compensate not negotiate. You idiot.”</p> 
 <p>Sasaki flinched in shock before keeping her mouth shut. The way Ju-Heon was smiling made her feel like she would die if she even said the c in compensate.</p> 
 <p>“A, aren’t we going on a date?”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon smiled brightly at that question.</p> 
 <p>“We're already on a date.”<br> “Eek?”</p> 
 <p>‘T, this is a date?’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon smiled without caring about the fact that Sasaki's mind was in a state of chaos.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, now that this onii-san went on a date with you, why don't we talk some business?”</p> 
 <p>He was smiling but Sasaki’s instincts were telling her something.</p> 
 <p>She might be young and stupid, but even she could tell this part.</p> 
 <p>‘M, mommy. He’s not a prince.’</p> 
 <p>The person in front of her was not a prince on a white horse but an evil Demon King.</p> 
 <p>However, it was too late to realize that.</p> 
 <p>This was just the start of a time of fear for her.</p>
