 <p>The artifact that Ju-Heon had activated was the silver-axe. The silver-axe that had returned to its original appearance roared in excitement that it would rip everything up.</p>
 <p>Human, hand over a woman. Hand over a woman. I don’t need men.</p>
 <p>That was what it was saying in words Ju-Heon could not understand, but Ju-Heon just channeled a lot of dominance into it.</p>
 <p>“Shut up and work. Silver-Axe.”</p>
 <p>Once the dominance was channeled into it, Chairman Kwon's suit instantly turned into rags and the artifact in his hand was destroyed and sent flying. Ju-Heon’s speed at using artifacts was extremely quick.</p>
 <p>“Ugh!”</p>
 <p>Of course, he had not ended up naked even though his clothes had turned to rags. Achilles’s Armor that Chairman Kwon was wearing, to be more specific, the black long johns were still there.</p>
 <p>Well, it looked more like a skin-tight pair of tights more than long johns.</p>
 <p>That was why Yoo Jaeha made a comment as he looked.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, my eyes are rotting!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to shout at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Get him! What the hell are you doing? Get that bastard!”</p>
 <p>The guards who had been taken down by Ju-Heon started to block the exit. Ju-Heon started to scoff as he saw them move.</p>
 <p>‘Aigoo, did I go too easy on them because they were civilians?</p>
 <p>Oh well.’</p>
 <p>“I won’t kill you guys because we are not in a tomb.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon casually took out Shakespeare’s pen.</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha turned pale as he watched Ju-Heon. He could not help but grab between his legs in reflex.</p>
 <p>‘Is this bastard perhaps.’</p>
 <p>And lo and behold. Ju-Heon who was moving the fountain pen around gave them something that was even worse than death.</p>
 <p>[The guards aiming for Seo Ju-Heon and Yoo Jaeha will suffer in pain as if they were right about to die.]</p>
 <p>Flash!</p>
 <p>The guards who were the best that money could buy screamed and fell to the ground while holding the spot between their legs.</p>
 <p>“Aigoo, Aigoo!”<br>“O, ow, son of a!”</p>
 <p>This was a terrible pain.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon laughed with satisfaction after seeing that the path was clear.</p>
 <p>“Perfect, it’s clear now.”<br>“Cruel bastard……”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon made sure to take care of Yoo Jaeha regardless of what he was saying.</p>
 <p>“Slave number 1. Hurry up and get up. Otherwise I am leaving without you.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha's eyes turned wide at that comment.</p>
 <p>“W, what? Slave number 1?”<br>“Ah, my mistake. Subordinate number 1.”<br>“?”</p>
 <p>The escape wasn't difficult. The guards had been down long ago and Yoo Jaeha just had to chase after Ju-Heon and get on a cab.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha who had escaped to a restaurant caught his breathe as he asked a question.</p>
 <p>“Hey you. I have a question.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon started to frown as if he didn’t like his tone.</p>
 <p>“You. Are you going to call your employer, ‘you,’ like that?”<br>"What’s wrong? You're three years younger than me. You still want me to call you President-nim or something?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha grumbled as he opened the menu.</p>
 <p>‘He said he’ll buy me a meal to celebrate my hiring but he’s acting all pompous calling himself the employer for a cheap meal.’</p>
 <p>However, Yoo Jaeha's face stiffened after looking at the menu. It was because the prices for the meat on the menu went beyond his wildest imaginations.</p>
 <p>It could not be helped.</p>
 <p>‘A fist sized steak is one million won?</p>
 <p>F*ck, did they cover the meat with gold or something?!’</p>
 <p>It was not just that. The wines were all 100 million won or higher and the cake for dessert cost hundreds of thousands of won for a single slice.</p>
 <p>‘I, impossible!’</p>
 <p>He had touched some money recently from the scams he pulled, but it was not too long ago that Yoo Jaeha had to beg for a hamburger because he couldn't even pay his rent. It was no wonder these prices were so shocking.</p>
 <p>The teary Yoo Jaeha could not help but ask this question.</p>
 <p>“S, sir, you're not going to order these and then make a run for it by saying you need to go to the restroom or something, right?”<br>“Am I you?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha cried internally after hearing Ju-Heon scoff. It was because he knew about Ju-Heon's intentions.</p>
 <p>‘How much work is this bastard planning to slam on me?!’</p>
 <p>That was indeed the case. Nobody was nice for no reason; Yoo Jaeha knew there was a reason Ju-Heon was feeding him this expensive meal. That was why Yoo Jaeha looked toward Ju-Heon with despair.</p>
 <p>“Umm………sir. In terms of the workload.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon chuckled after seeing his title change almost instantly.</p>
 <p>“Don't worry, I will make sure you have a set time to come and leave work. I'm someone who believes that employees need their free time. So eat whatever you want.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha sighed in relief and started to smile brightly.</p>
 <p>“Please let me know whatever you need! I will do anything!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon just smiled wickedly at him.</p>
 <p>‘Punk, that’s more like it.’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon was indeed planning on paying him handsomely and give him set hours and free time.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>‘Your work hours end when you are finished with your work.’</p>
 <p>As for free time…</p>
 <p>‘Restoration itself is free time for you.’</p>
 <p>That was indeed the case.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon was an evil employer who believed that artists’ free time was drawing and a restorer’s free time was restoring artifacts.</p>
 <p>‘So I'll let you touch artifacts all you want until you grow tired of it.’</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Yoo Jaeha did not have a Divine-Grade restoration skill right now. That was why his only choice was to quickly help him grow. The only way to get used to restoration was to restore as many artifacts as possible.</p>
 <p>‘So eat a ton while you can.’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon smiled wickedly while looking at Yoo Jaeha who was happily looking through the menu.</p>
 <p>People really were not nice for no reason.</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha then took a destroyed necklace out of his pocket and ask.</p>
 <p>“Ah, by the way, this thing. What does this artifact do?”<br>"Ah, that? It’s nothing much.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon chuckled as he showed him the mobile news on his phone.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>[TKBM Embezzlement of Corporate Funds]<br>[Chairman Kwon Tae Joon's secret mistress]<br>[Chairman Kwon Tae Joon's sugar baby]<br>[Chairman Kwon Tae Joon sexually assaults an office employee]<br>.<br>.<br>Nothing much?</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon who was being impacted by Marie Antoinette’s artifact was about to faint in shock.<br>First Seo Ju-Heon and now Yoo Jaeha!</p>
 <p>Edward and Jean Richard who were watching the live internet news were laughing.</p>
 <p>“Edward. Is this really that artifact’s power?”</p>
 <p>The first to speak was Jean Richard.</p>
 <p>He was a bald French man with a gentle smile. He was the artist who was respected as the father of modern art, a politician, and a famous broadcaster. He had flown from Yale in the US east coast to LA because of Yoo Jaeha.</p>
 <p>The informer and artifact dealer Edward responded to him.</p>
 <p>“You said that Jaeha had something that looked like a necklace?”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to frown.</p>
 <p>“Yes. It was a silver necklace I saw at the auction house. I didn’t buy it because I didn't get much of a feel from it.”</p>
 <p>“Then I should be right. It should be Marie Antoinette’s Necklace. I remember hearing that it was sold at the Midas auction this time. It looks like that Seo Ju-Heon bastard handed Jaeha that item.”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon sighed in response.</p>
 <p>For that artifact to have such abilities… Why had he not realized it back then?</p>
 <p>That was indeed the case.</p>
 <p>Marie Antoinette’s Necklace that Yoo Jaeha activated was a disaster-type artifact that spreads malicious rumors. It was an artifact that placed false charges on a person.</p>
 <p>The reason such ability came to be was simple.</p>
 <p>Marie Antoinette’s diamond necklace incident.</p>
 <p>Supposedly, the Queen of France tried to buy this extravagant highest-class diamond necklace when the rest of France was suffering. The truth was that the Queen was falsely charged.</p>
 <p>Without any regard for the truth, the Queen became an icon of extravagance because of it, and that incident made the citizens angry that the malicious rumor about the queen had spread.</p>
 <p>That was the reason the necklace had such an ability.</p>
 <p>[Creates rumors to cut down a despised subject’s reputation.]</p>
 <p>The only catch was that the person had to be visible to the user. Ju-Heon who had tailed Yoo Jaeha had appeared as soon as he felt the artifact being used. It was great proof that Yoo Jaeha was angry at Chairman Kwon. In some ways, it was as if Yoo Jaeha had summoned Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>Well, it was a gift if the plan was to make Chairman Kwon suffer. It was also a wicked bait to prevent Yoo Jaeha from having any second thoughts.</p>
 <p>Any smart person would not want to serve a Chairman with such rumors!<br>In the end, Yoo Jaeha had cut his own connections with Chairman Kwon because of Ju-Heon, but who could he blame? He could only blame himself for using the artifact.</p>
 <p>Richard started to console Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>“It’ll be revealed soon enough that they are all rumors. You'll take a bit of hit though.”</p>
 <p>Rather, Richard was more concerned about Yoo Jaeha and Seo Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>‘I guess I really should have killed that Yoo Jaeha bastard.’</p>
 <p>And then, Seo Ju-Heon who took such a bastard in…</p>
 <p>‘I need to get rid of him and that Seo Ju-Heon bastard before they give us any more headaches.’</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon would suffer a bit but it didn’t matter.</p>
 <p>‘Those bastards won't be able to use artifacts once &lt; Pandora &gt; is completed anyway.’</p>
 <p>Even talented bastards would be no more than regular people if they could not use artifacts.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, don’t worry. I’ll take care of that retard Yoo Jaeha so you don’t need to worry about that. Ah, and I will restore your artifacts for you.”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to frown.</p>
 <p>“Is that possible? What about work for &lt; Pandora &gt;?”<br>“It's fine. As for the restoration, I'll do it for you if you bring me a restoration artifact. Do you think I can't do something that that retard Yoo Jaeha can do?”</p>
 <p>He was confident that he could do it better than Yoo Jaeha.</p>
 <p>Probably.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>“Wow, sir, you're so thorough. Working for that bastard seems terrible because of Queen Marie’s artifact.”<br>“You don't want to work for a Chairman who is being accused of having a secret mistress?”<br>“Hoho.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha started to laugh. Was he wrong to think that he was playing on top of this man’s palm?</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon then continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, now that you work for me, Jean Richard will probably become Chairman Kwon's restorer.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha almost spit out the mojito he had been drinking.</p>
 <p>“H, hold on. What did you say?!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon who was eating dessert nonchalantly responded. He was someone who knew about Chairman Kwon and Richard’s relationship.</p>
 <p>That was how he knew that Chairman Kwon would reject whatever Yoo Jaeha asked for.</p>
 <p>Why?</p>
 <p>Because Jean Richard is an invaluable partner for Chairman Kwon. Even if he pretended to accept Yoo Jaeha’s request, he would not have wanted to do anything to get on Richard’s nerves.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, Richard will be Chairman Kwon’s restorer so keep that in mind.”</p>
 <p>Of course, he had not been a restorer in the past as Yoo Jaeha was Chairman Kwon's restorer. He was curious how the future would change.</p>
 <p>However, Yoo Jaeha’s eyes shook for a moment. Yoo Jaeha seemed to be a bit afraid as he had been trampled on by Jean Richard once already.</p>
 <p>However, he convinced himself internally.</p>
 <p>‘No. Things are different now.’</p>
 <p>He would definitely take Jean Richard down and retrieve his painting. That was why he decided to work with Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon who read his gaze smiled and started to cheer him up.</p>
 <p>“Don't worry. That bastard Richard is someone I need to take care of as well. Richard is a thorn in my eyes as well.”<br>“Why?”<br>“Reasons. Mainly because of the business those bastards are planning.”</p>
 <p>That bastard’s &lt; Pandora &gt; plan was the problem.</p>
 <p>In short, that business would only allow people close to them to use artifacts. It was naturally something Ju-Heon needed to avoid.</p>
 <p>Richard who was a central figure for that business was naturally a thorn in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha asked a question since Richard was brought up.</p>
 <p>“Umm, sir, how do you plan on taking on Richard? He’s at a different level.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon got to the point now that Yoo Jaeha took the bait.</p>
 <p>“It’s simple. You just need to satisfy someone. You just need to do as I tell you to do. Well, that person will definitely be helpful.”<br>“Who is this person?”<br>“It's about time they showed up.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon who checked the time looked toward the door.</p>
 <p>And lo and behold, there was a woman heading over with a smile on her face. However, Yoo Jaeha turned pale after seeing her.</p>
 <p>It was because there was no way he didn’t know who she was.</p>
 <p>Because…</p>
 <p>‘I, Irene Holten?!'</p>
 <p>That woman was the younger sister of George Holten, the man he scammed for a large sum of money! The family that he had to fake his own death to run away from!</p>
 <p>Yoo Jaeha who knew what he had done turned away in reflex.</p>
 <p>‘I need to run away!’</p>
 <p>He was probably dead meat if he was caught by that family!</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon grabbed Yoo Jaeha who tried to run away and smiled wickedly.</p>
 <p>“I thought you wanted to get your painting back.”</p>
 <p>‘Damn it!’</p>
