 <p></p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha was thinking that Ju-Heon was showing off when he didn't know anything.</p> 
 <p>‘I am the pro. You think you are the pro? No matter how quickly you do it, it’s at least a week per artifact, at least a week.’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha smirked while having that thought. It was because he was confident that there were no restorers who were at his level right now.</p> 
 <p>That was why he said the following.</p> 
 <p>“Ah right, why don’t you give a demonstration while telling us how it is done? Anybody can say they are an artist, the top student, a maestro or have an annual salary of 100 million won. I won't believe it unless I see it with my own eyes.”</p> 
 <p>‘Look at this punk, he wants a demonstration?’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha then provoked him further.</p> 
 <p>“But I’ll bet my salary that you can’t do it.”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon chuckled at that statement.</p> 
 <p>‘He’s going to bet his salary?</p> 
 <p>He shouldn't say something like that without thinking.’</p> 
 <p>“Really?”<br> “Yes sir! Captain-nim, if you can show me a demonstration, I will restore those 10 artifacts in a single day! I also won't receive a salary! But if I win…”<br> “If you win?”<br> “I will take a month to restore every artifact as you have touched my pride as a restorer. I want to relax as I work!”<br> “Is that so?”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon smirked for some reason. However, Yoo Jaeha who did not know the meaning of the smirk was sneering internally.</p> 
 <p>‘He seems to have some artifact restoration knowledge, but I will burn my own hand if he can really do it. I'll burn my own damn hand. <span id="footnote-ref-69f0"><a href="#footnote-69f0">[1]</a></span> Restoration artifacts are not things that just anybody can handle.’</p> 
 <p>However…<br> He heard an unexpected response.</p> 
 <p>"A demonstration? Sure, why not.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha questioned his ears before his expression stiffened.</p> 
 <p>“…………….Excuse me? U, umm, what did you say?”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon just motioned with his finger as if telling him to hand something over.</p> 
 <p>“I'll show you. Hand over your restoration artifact.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha could not help but become anxious.</p> 
 <p>“W, wait, what did you say?”<br> “I told you to hand it over.”</p> 
 <p>‘Is he being serious?’<br> Yoo Jaeha finally realized that something was wrong.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>About thirty minutes later…</p> 
 <p>‘This really makes no sense.’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha could not help but have cold sweats all over his body. He couldn't help it because this situation was unbelievable.</p> 
 <p>That was indeed the case.<br> It was crazy.</p> 
 <p>His employer must be crazy.</p> 
 <p>‘What the hell, something like that is possible?!’</p> 
 <p>Flash!</p> 
 <p>Another bright light flashed outside the cafe. In a narrow alley with nobody else… Ju-Heon who had asked Irene for a moment and walked out of the cafe to restore an artifact was moving his hand quickly.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon had a brush pen you would find at a stationary store in his hand, and his hand was moving so quickly as if he was a video being fast-forwarded.</p> 
 <p>Thanks to that, Yoo Jaeha could not help but stand there with his jaw dropped.</p> 
 <p>Even a restorer would not be able to restore such a critical injury so cleanly in such a short amount of time!</p> 
 <p>However, Ju-Heon just calmly started to speak without paying any regards to what Yoo Jaeha was thinking.</p> 
 <p>“There. Isn’t it easy?”</p> 
 <p>That statement made Yoo Jaeha almost say the F word.</p> 
 <p>‘This bastard, easy my ass!’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon looked like a certain mister who was holding a brush, smiling, and saying, ‘wasn’t that easy?’ </p> 
 <p>That was indeed the case.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon picked up the &lt; Brush from the Joseon Palace Flower Garden - B-Grade (Consumable Artifact) &gt; and started restoring an artifact as if he was used to it. <br> But what the hell?!</p> 
 <p>‘Ah, this is driving me nuts, I bet my salary on it!’</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha was crying internally.</p> 
 <p>He had considered himself to be talented in restoration, but he just looked like someone who was trying to teach a fish how to swim!</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, Ju-Heon's knowledge of restoration that he was spewing out as if he was a professor, was not at an amateur’s level.</p> 
 <p>‘Shit, how is this possible?’</p> 
 <p>It was as if he was an elementary school student while Ju-Heon was a university professor!</p> 
 <p>That was why Yoo Jaeha was going crazy as he felt shame, but also admiration for Ju-Heon’s sense of restoration.</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it, I might fall for him! No, this bastard is definitely a bad bastard!’</p> 
 <p>Although Ju-Heon was a shitty superior, Yoo Jaeha the genius artist could not do anything about it. He could not help but respect someone who could create wonderful works of art.</p> 
 <p>That was why Yoo Jaeha shouted in pain.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it, Captain-nim! You're even more talented at it than I am! Why are you making me restore artifacts?!”<br> "Why? Because it's annoying.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha almost fainted after hearing that. However, Ju-Heon just chuckled while looking at Yoo Jaeha.</p> 
 <p>It took a lot of focus and energy to use restoration artifacts.</p> 
 <p>That wasn’t the only thing.</p> 
 <p>“Also, my using restoration artifacts would destroy them too quickly. They can't tolerate me. It’ll be like using something that could be used 100 times just once and throwing it away.”<br> “R, really?”</p> 
 <p>That was the truth. Restoration artifacts focused on affinity, but Ju-Heon's affinity was so low that the restoration artifact would try to commit self-harm.</p> 
 <p>Honestly speaking, he had forced the brush to activate just now to the point that the artifact tried to reject Ju-Heon and its durability significantly went down. In simple terms, they were not a good fit for him.</p> 
 <p>But most importantly…</p> 
 <p>‘My skills are only at the level of regular restorers.’</p> 
 <p>He was just someone who could patch things up.</p> 
 <p>That’s how restoration worked.</p> 
 <p>Restoring artifacts was similar to restoring ancient cultural items where the restorer patched things up to look normal. There was no way to completely restore something that was damaged.</p> 
 <p>Of course, that meant that it was impossible to restore something that was broken into pieces or to return the durability to normal.</p> 
 <p>However, Yoo Jaeha was different.</p> 
 <p>‘Don’t look so down. You have a much higher level of &lt; Fit &gt; than I do.’</p> 
 <p>That was indeed the case.</p> 
 <p>&lt; Fit &gt; was something that existed separately from Dominance and Affinity.</p> 
 <p>Basically, Fit represented natural talent to handle specific artifacts based on heritage or abilities.</p> 
 <p>For example, a talented mathematician would have a high chance of handling math-related artifacts very well. Other examples would be musicians with music-based artifacts or Jews with historical Jewish artifacts.</p> 
 <p>‘And this punk has a scary level of fit with art-type artifacts.’</p> 
 <p>Normally, a person would be able to pull out close to 100% of an artifact's abilities with their dominance or affinity and there was no way to get past that.</p> 
 <p>However, the people with extremely high levels of Fit were able to pull out the hidden abilities that went above 100%.</p> 
 <p>It was very rare, but Yoo Jaeha was able to do such a thing with art-type artifacts.</p> 
 <p>He was able to completely revive artifacts with &lt; Artifact Revival &gt; and &lt; Artifact Regression. &gt;</p> 
 <p>He was able to revive an artifact that was destroyed into pieces back to normal and regress an artifact that had lost all durability back to full durability. </p> 
 <p>It could be considered an upgraded restoration skill.</p> 
 <p>‘That is why you are going to become an Elite restorer that nobody can match in a little bit. You little punk.’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon started to laugh wickedly as he was the only one to know that fact.</p> 
 <p>“Your annual salary. You said you will give it up, right?”<br> “Damn it!”</p> 
 <p>He then smiled without caring for Yoo Jaeha's grumbling as he had this unmatched Elite working for him for free.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, get started right away since I showed you a demonstration. You have exactly 24 hours from right now. Finish restoring all 10 artifacts.”</p> 
 <p>Yoo Jaeha wanted to jump up and down in anger after hearing that.</p> 
 <p>‘Why does this person have to even be good at restoring artifacts?!’</p> 
 <p>Why?</p> 
 <p>It was because he had to hand over all good artifacts to Chairman Kwon and had to develop his other abilities if he wanted to survive.</p> 
 <p>The restore skill that he had used for emergency situations inside tombs had increased Ju-Heon's rate of survival.</p> 
 <p>“Shut up and get started. Ah, by the way, I will decrease the time to 10 hours if you fail this time. No eating or leaving work until you are done.”<br> “Hey! You devil!”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon chuckled.</p> 
 <p>‘Grow quickly if you hate it that much, Yoo Jaeha.’</p> 
 <p>It might sound like an impossible task, but Ju-Heon knew this punk's extremely competitive nature. He was the type to get fired up when he saw someone who was better than him at something.</p> 
 <p>And lo and behold, Yoo Jaeha who had seen Ju-Heon's abilities was burning up with the thought of catching up to Ju-Heon as quickly as possible.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>[The Dexterity skill has risen to C-rank!]</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Quickly learn how to use any item (artifact) even if it is your first time using it.</li> 
  <li>Speed of consumption decreases significantly when using consumable artifacts.</li> 
  <li>Quite Skillful in artifact maintenance and restoration.</li> 
  <li>Chances of stealing artifacts from other people increases significantly.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>[ You have received the title of &lt; Superhuman Restoration Expert &gt; and have learned about the existence of a new skill.]<br> [&lt; Tomb Restoration (F-Rank) &gt; skill has been awakened.]</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon was shocked after seeing the sudden messages.</p> 
 <p>‘Huh?’</p> 
 <p>He was fine with the sudden messages by now. The crow seemed to awaken some weird things here and there.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>‘Not regular restoration but tomb restoration?</p> 
 <p>What kind of skill is this?’</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon only had an artifact restoration skill in the past. However, he seemed to have gotten a special restoration skill different than the artifact restoration skill he used in the past.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon decided to test out the skill.<br> However…</p> 
 <p>[This skill cannot be used unless you are inside a tomb or near a tomb.]</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon decided to ignore it for now since he would eventually learn about its uses.</p> 
 <p>Now that he taught this punk Yoo Jaeha a lesson, he needed to handle Irene now.</p> 
 <p>And lo and behold, Irene was looking at Ju-Heon with anticipation when he returned to the cafe. Ju-Heon smiled while looking at her.</p> 
 <p>“It’s time to remove your curse now.”</p> 
 <p>Irene’s face brightened after hearing his comment.</p> 
 <p>‘Finally!’</p> 
 <p>“Do you think it is possible?”<br> “Possible my ass.”<br> “!”</p> 
 <p>The person who responded was not Ju-Heon but Yoo Jaeha who was next to him. He plopped down on the ground and started to sniffle.</p> 
 <p>“Aigoo. I'm done for! I hope the Earth blows up tomorrow.”</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon just chuckled while looking at Yoo Jaeha. He probably thought that he was ruined because he would need to work without pay for the rest of his life.</p> 
 <p>‘Don't worry. I’ll add your salary on to the bonuses.’</p> 
 <p>Of course, Ju-Heon had no plans on telling him about this right now. Why? Yoo Jaeha was fired up for something else because he had lost his salary.</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it, if it is like this, I might as well work hard at restoring artifacts to earn a lot of bonuses.’</p> 
 <p>The unreliable restorer had become extremely inspired.</p> 
 <p>Ju-Heon who was easily handling his subordinate like this started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You don't need to worry about this punk. It’s time for us to have our conversation.”</p> 
 <p>“Okay! How will you do it?”</p> 
 <p>It was fine until that point. Irene was feeling positive as well.<br> However…</p> 
 <p>“The method is simple. However…”<br> “However?”<br> “You have to give them to me. Your time and your body.”</p> 
 <p>He said something that might give people the wrong idea as if it was nothing. </p>
