 <p>‘What did he just say? Rotten tone?’</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo could not even laugh in disbelief. What was this young bastard saying to him right now?</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo had no plans to chat nicely with Ju-Heon who had ridiculed Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>He was planning on taking care of Ju-Heon and stealing the almond tree as he had done until now. His artifact was a curse-type artifact that could easily take care of people.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, this was the United States. Why would a foreign nature put any effort into what happened to an Asian foreigner?</p>
 <p>However, he had been kicked by that opponent he had been looking down on.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Are you crazy? How dare you hit me!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon just casually smiled without caring whether Yoon Shi Woo was screaming or not.</p>
 <p>“Weren’t you the one who came to see me?”<br>“……You bastard!”<br>“Then fix your tone and sit straight. Then I will listen to what you have to say.”<br>“……!”</p>
 <p>‘Is he really crazy?!’</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo continued to frown at this indignity but Ju-Heon was sneering internally.</p>
 <p>‘He probably came here thinking that he would kill me and take the Herb of Eternal Youth.’</p>
 <p>The Yoon Shi Woo he knew was that kind of bastard. Furthermore, it was obvious Yoon Shi Woo was mistaking him as a regular person.</p>
 <p>It made sense why he would make that mistake and this was the time when only people like Chairman Kwon were monopolizing artifacts.</p>
 <p>It was also the time this bastard started to get stuck up. Artifacts tended to make people arrogant as well.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>‘He’s still a useless fool who complained about being inferior to me.’</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo, age 29 years old.</p>
 <p>He was someone who tried to bring Ju-Heon down with everything he had and made things entertaining for Ju-Heon. In that regard, for Ju-Heon who was the Captain of the tomb raiding team, he was a subordinate who hated him.</p>
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon started to smile while thinking about the past.</p>
 <p>‘How great. Let's teach this bastard a lesson like I used to.’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon was riling this bastard up on purpose.</p>
 <p>Why?</p>
 <p>Making people feel shamed was a way to weaken their dominance, allowing Ju-Heon to steal his weapon.</p>
 <p>‘Those with more pride are bound to feel more shame.’</p>
 <p>However, Yoon Shi Woo did not know this as he started to grind his teeth before responding.</p>
 <p>“We met at the auction house, right? I came to see you for that reason.”<br>“I don’t recall.”<br>“Stop joking! We definitely saw each other!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon then chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Ah, the useless guy hanging onto that old man.”</p>
 <p>It was at that moment. A message window popped up in front of Ju-Heon's eyes.</p>
 <p>[The other party has lost his cool and his dominance is temporarily weakening.]</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon chuckled as he read that.</p>
 <p>This truly was Yoon Shi Woo’s weakness.</p>
 <p>He was the young master of a large corporation who was stripped of his successor title after causing an incident.</p>
 <p>He narrowly escaped his terrible fate by being a special admit into TKBM's excavation team but he continued to feel shame at the fact that he had to suck up to Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon squinted knowing that was the case.</p>
 <p>“Now that I think about it, I did get a call from Chairman Kwon Tae Joon. I guess he really needs that sexual enhancer. Does he have a new mistress or something?”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo questioned if he heard correctly before getting angry.</p>
 <p>‘This rude bastard.’</p>
 <p>Of course, he wasn't angry because Ju-Heon was talking shit about someone who was like a father to him, it was the result of the Pavlovian conditioning that he needed to look good for Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon didn't stop there.</p>
 <p>“It looks like you came all this way to deliver that tree to Chairman Kwon. What a good loyal dog.”</p>
 <p>[The other party has lost his cool and his dominance is temporarily weakening.]</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo glared and put his hand in his pocket.</p>
 <p>‘Do I get rid of him right now with this?’</p>
 <p>His hand touched his artifact. It was the artifact he brought with him to take care of Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>However, Yoon Shi Woo ground his teeth and shook his head.</p>
 <p>‘There are still people watching.’</p>
 <p>There was also something he wanted to confirm as well.</p>
 <p>“I will get right to the point. What is your relationship with Irene Holten?”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon just laughed loudly instead of responding.</p>
 <p>“Hey useless. Didn’t I tell you to fix your tone first?”<br>“……Ugh!”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo's eyes opened wide.</p>
 <p>This damn thug should be feeling thankful that he was even willing to talk to him!</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon looked at him and smiled again.</p>
 <p>“I will say this again but you are the one who came here to see me, I have no reason to listen. Why don't you think things through properly?”<br>“Ugh.”<br>“Well, I might just hand that tree over to you depending on how you act. I just received it as a gift as well.”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo's gaze changed at this unexpected offer.</p>
 <p>Using an artifact with limited use to forcibly take it or to get it for free. Even children would know which was the better option.</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo thought for a moment before thinking he could swallow his pride a bit for that.</p>
 <p>“…My deepest apologies. Mr. Seo Ju-Heon. I will rephrase my question. Uhh, I wish to ask about your relationship with Irene Holten.”</p>
 <p>‘It should be fine now, right?’</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon was not one who would give the answer Yoon Shi Woo was seeking that easily.</p>
 <p>“Your tone sounds much better. But you are still lacking common sense. Shouldn't you introduce yourself first? Or hand over a business card or something?”</p>
 <p>‘Damn it, this bastard!’</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo crunched his teeth as he handed a business card over.</p>
 <p>‘This is all for the Chairman-nim!”</p>
 <p>“I am this kind of person.”</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon just laughed without receiving the business card.</p>
 <p>“Put it away. I don't need it.”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo almost swore after hearing Ju-Heon laugh.</p>
 <p>‘Then why the hell did you ask for it?!’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon then laughed and answered Yoon Shi Woo's question in a way that seemed as if he was praising a subordinate. It might have been an old habit.</p>
 <p>“I met Irene Holten for the first time in the auction house. She kept following me around after I told her she was pretty.”<br>“Then what about that tree?”<br>“I got annoyed with her following me so I said I'll give her my number if she buys that for me.”</p>
 <p>It wasn’t the truth but he wasn’t going to sell them any information about Irene.</p>
 <p>However, Yoon Shi Woo who had no way of knowing that was extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>‘She paid 500 million dollars for the tree for that reason?’</p>
 <p>It could be shocking, but the fact that it was announced in the past that Irene liked Asian men and that Ju-Heon was handsome made it sound believable. Why else would a celebrity like that hang around a thug like this?</p>
 <p>That resolved most of his curiosity.</p>
 <p>‘I guess I don’t need to pay much attention to it.’</p>
 <p>They had the secretary do a good amount of investigation into Ju-Heon already, but he had thought Ju-Heon might have a connection with a celebrity because he was hanging out with Irene.</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo sighed in relief as he continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“Then are you willing to hand that tree over, sir?”<br>“Are you crazy?”<br>“Excuse me? But you said earlier that you would hand the tree over……”<br>“Hey idiot, did you really believe that?’</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo instantly started to frown.</p>
 <p>[The other party's cool has been severely shaken. The other party's dominance has temporarily fallen from A-Grade to D-Grade(Antique-Grade).]<br>[The artifact that has been repressed is starting to rampage.]</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo couldn’t hold back anymore and took out his artifact. He couldn't deal with it anymore.</p>
 <p>“You motherf*cking bastard! Good, I should have done this from the beginning! I'll use it to turn you into a slave and make you die a dog's death, you bastard!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon who had his arms crossed tilted his head and laughed.</p>
 <p>“It’s probably best you stop.”<br>“You son of a bitch!”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo then activated the artifact in his hand.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo instantly started to frown. It was because the artifact he used showed no reaction.</p>
 <p>“Uhh, uhh?”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo became anxious.</p>
 <p>He definitely used his dominance but the artifact did not activate!</p>
 <p>“W, what is going on?!”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo had taken out a glass bottle. The item inside the cosmetic bottle looked like women's powder or flour.</p>
 <p>However, this was a curse-type artifact.</p>
 <p>“Why isn't it activating?!”</p>
 <p>However, at that moment…</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo's head was forcibly grabbed and he fell toward the table.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo could not help but scream as his head was slammed on the table and his arm was twisted back.</p>
 <p>“Aaaaaaaaaak!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon was pushing down on Yoon Shi Woo's head like a cop arresting a thief.</p>
 <p>“Hey bastard, that hurts! Aaah! Let go!”</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon just smiled at him.</p>
 <p>“That’s why I asked if you were crazy. You moron. How can you use an artifact when your dominance has fallen?”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo questioned his ears for a moment.</p>
 <p>‘Artifact?<br>Did this bastard just say artifact?’</p>
 <p>“You bastard! So you do know about artif……!”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo flailed and tried to use his artifact. However, the artifact still did not activate.</p>
 <p>‘!’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon used that opening to easily take the bottle away from Yoon Shi Woo's hand.</p>
 <p>“Hey!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon then easily channeled his dominance into the bottle.</p>
 <p>“Obey my orders.”</p>
 <p>The powder inside the cosmetic bottle slowly started to move and Yoon Shi Woo turned pale after seeing what was going on.</p>
 <p>“F*ck, why is that listening to that bastard?!”</p>
 <p>That was the case.</p>
 <p>The item that Yoon Shi Woo had taken out was a powder-type curse artifact. It was not a consumable artifact but a possession artifact contracted to an owner.</p>
 <p>[Voodoo Priest’s Zombie Powder (A-Grade(Treasure-Grade) - Possession Artifact)]</p>
 <p>The Voodoo belief that originated from the Black slaves of Africa. They were said to use this zombie powder to turn believers into zombies to punish them.</p>
 <p>This artifact was born from those rumors that had filled the media and solidified itself in people's minds.</p>
 <p>In simple terms, if you touch the powder or swallow it, an evil spirit possesses your body and you become a zombie slave with no rationality.</p>
 <p>‘But you need enough dominance to use a good artifact.’ Dominance was related to a person's mental strength, so people like Yoon Shi Woo who could not control their minds often saw their dominance stagger.</p>
 <p>That was why even a Possession artifact like this instantly betrayed its master.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon smiled brightly.</p>
 <p>“That’s why I always told you not to be useless and feel inferior.”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo who was pinned down by Ju-Heon ground his teeth. He thought Ju-Heon was mocking him.</p>
 <p>“You son of a bitch, what bullshit are you saying now?! I'm going to kill you!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon smiled with his eyes before tipping the bottle.</p>
 <p>“I guess you haven't learned your lesson yet.”</p>
 <p>The powder that seemed to be alive charged toward Yoon Shi Woo and covered him.</p>
 <p>A desperate screech echoed from this corner bar.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>“That idiot!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon’s hands were shaking as he could not control his anger.</p>
 <p>How did the punk who arrogantly said he would go get the artifact yesterday return in such a mess?!</p>
 <p>And lo and behold. In front his eyes was a naked Yoon Shi Woo flailing around in a cell.</p>
 <p>“Are you his guardian?”<br>“………”</p>
 <p>That was the case.</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon had shown up to the police station after receiving a call.</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo had supposedly walked around Las Vegas naked chasing after women and sexually harassing them.</p>
 <p>Pictures were already being printed in articles! It was extremely shameful as the Korean news was reporting that he was TKBM's Chairman Kwon’s future son-in-law.</p>
 <p>How would he deal with this mess?!</p>
 <p>However, Yoon Shi Woo seemed to be seeing an illusion and unable to realize what was going on.</p>
 <p>He was just groaning like a zombie even while being in solitary confinement.</p>
 <p>The cops were just treating him as a junkie.</p>
 <p>However, the secretary peeked toward Chairman Kwon in shock after taking a look at Yoon Shi Woo’s condition.</p>
 <p>“Umm, C, Chairman-nim. This seems to be……”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon touched his forehead as if he had a headache.</p>
 <p>“I'm certain of it. This is the effect of this bastard's artifact.”</p>
 <p>‘This stupid bastard.’</p>
 <p>He had a headache because of this son-in-law who was causing him all sorts of embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon did not have a left arm or right arm person during this time.</p>
 <p>He would have pushed Yoon Shi Woo to the curb if he didn’t have a useful level of dominance.</p>
 <p>“C, Chairman-nim. What do we do?”<br>“Leave the punk here but go recover the artifact he had on him.”</p>
 <p>The secretary looked scared after hearing that question.</p>
 <p>“That, you see.”<br>“Now what?!”<br>“That……he had nothing on him when they found him. Chairman-nim, your artifacts that he took with him are all missing as well.”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon frowned before his eyes opened wide in shock.</p>
 <p>“WHAT?!”</p>
