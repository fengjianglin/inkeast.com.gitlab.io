 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was a voice he had heard before. The day he had been betrayed by Chairman Kwon… Had he not heard this voice inside that tomb?</p>
 <p>The voice echoed out again.</p>
 <p>[The human who has the qualifications to possess me. Danger will soon strike.]</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon looked around after hearing the voice again.</p>
 <p>He was certain.</p>
 <p>It was the voice of the bastard who sent him back to the past and gave him a new opportunity.</p>
 <p>‘But why is that bastard speaking to me now?’</p>
 <p>He then heard the voice again.</p>
 <p>[Human, hurry over this way.]</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon then started to frown.</p>
 <p>‘Go that way?</p>
 <p>Does he think I'm crazy enough to do that?’</p>
 <p>This bastard was the owner of the unclearable tomb that forced his greatest tomb raiding team in the world to die without being able to put up much fight.</p>
 <p>It was not something he could dominate right now.</p>
 <p>‘I don't know why it is calling me over, but…’</p>
 <p>He was thankful that it sent him to the past but Ju-Heon was not interested in this crow bastard at all.</p>
 <p>Of course, he needed strong Divine-Grade artifacts. Chairman Kwon had one and he needed at least one Divine-Grade artifact to become a monopolizer. However, the crow was an artifact even Ju-Heon didn’t know about.</p>
 <p>‘The fact that I have no information is too dangerous.’</p>
 <p>However, the crow continued to be persistent.</p>
 <p>[Hurry over to me. Danger will soon strike this place.]</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon found it a bit odd that it sounded as if it was giving him a warning, but he soon shook his head thinking that was not possible. He knew better than anybody else that there were no artifacts that cared about humans.</p>
 <p>‘It’s all just part of an artifact’s ploy.’</p>
 <p>It happened as Ju-Heon tried to walk outside after having that thought.</p>
 <p>“Look at the mess you caused.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon smirked as he turned around after hearing the familiar voice.</p>
 <p>‘He’s here.’</p>
 <p>And lo and behold, an angry Chairman Kwon was standing there.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>Ju-Heon had a twisted smile on his face as he looked at the tall middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>The person in front of him was none other than Kwon Tae Joon, Chairman of TKBM.</p>
 <p>He was in his mid-fifties but looked quite fit for a middle-aged man. And although he was old, the charisma flowing out of his gaze was oppressive and cold, fitting his title as a monopolizer.</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon was laughing internally while looking at him.</p>
 <p>This was because he could tell that Chairman Kwon was angry even though he had a gentleman's smile on the outside.</p>
 <p>“Nice to meet you, Mr. Kwon Tae Joon?”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon scoffed after hearing Ju-Heon mock him. He had expected it, but Ju-Heon was even more disrespectful than he expected.</p>
 <p>“You must be Seo Ju-Heon.”<br>“And if I am?”</p>
 <p>Unlike the calm Ju-Heon, the Oh Seung Woo group were wary of Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>“Hyung-nim, are you sure it is okay? That big-boobed woman who was doing a strip show……no, no, that lawyer, wasn’t he the one who sent her?!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon turned toward the Oh Seung Woo group and greeted them as well.</p>
 <p>“Friends, its my first time meeting all of you. My name is Kwon Tae Joon.”<br>“Ah yes, yes sir!”</p>
 <p>However, the Oh Seung Woo group started to sweat the moment they made eye contact with Kwon Tae Joon. It was because they had this weird feeling that they should be bowing 90 degrees toward him.</p>
 <p>That was extremely weird.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon who saw this clicked his tongue and started to frown.</p>
 <p>‘That damn old bastard.’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon took a sword out of his pocket. He then quickly moved and appeared behind Chairman Kwon before turning his head and pointing the knife at Chairman Kwon’s neck.</p>
 <p>It was an extremely crisp movement thanks to the combination of a possession-type artifact and a pro’s abilities.</p>
 <p>“!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon’s eyes opened wide in shock. The knife Ju-Heon was using was the Egyptian Priest’s Knife.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon could clearly see the location of Chairman Kwon’s organs once he held the knife in his hand. Ju-Heon who confirmed this then put on a cold smile as if he would really dig those organs out.</p>
 <p>“Chairman-nim. Pull back your powers if you don’t want to die.”</p>
 <p>He seemed to have done this quite a few times. Of course, Ju-Heon was smarter than to kill a large corporation's boss out here when they were not even inside a tomb.</p>
 <p>However, the situation was quite bad right now.</p>
 <p>‘This old bastard is trying to make us submit?’</p>
 <p>That was the case.</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon was using his dominance that should be used to make artifacts submit on them, and the Oh Seung Woo group had been suppressed by Chairman Kwon's dominance.</p>
 <p>Dominance was something that could be used on both artifacts and humans. Those with a strong will could suppress those with weaker wills.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t as if dominance could be used to mind control people, but it was enough to make the weaker people feel fear and intimidation.</p>
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon was using the knife to threaten Chairman Kwon's life.</p>
 <p>“I told you to pull your power back because it is unpleasant.”</p>
 <p>It didn't affect him much but it did feel unpleasant and Ju-Heon was someone who took good care of people who he took in as his subordinates.</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to laugh.</p>
 <p>“I knew there was a reason Yoon Shi Woo and Lawyer Lee couldn’t take care of you.”</p>
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group fell over and started to breathe heavily once Chairman Kwon withdrew his dominance.</p>
 <p>“I, I'm alive.”</p>
 <p>The three who felt as if they were going to die were looking at Ju-Heon as if he was a monster.</p>
 <p>‘How is Ju-Heon fine through all this?’</p>
 <p>They didn't know what it was, but they were unable to bear it because Chairman Kwon had seemed extremely scary. However, Chairman Kwon had realized something shocking because of this.</p>
 <p>‘Seo Ju-Heon is stronger than I expected.’</p>
 <p>Maybe that was the reason. Chairman Kwon's instincts were telling him that Ju-Heon was dangerous. Chairman Kwon came to a single conclusion after having that thought.</p>
 <p>“I think it will be best to get rid of people like you who know about artifacts.”</p>
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group became shocked after seeing his frightening gaze. They had seen how Lee Jin-A had turned into a zombie slave just now.</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon was calm unlike his scared subordinates. Chairman Kwon who was thinking that Ju-Heon was extremely confident started to laugh.</p>
 <p>“There’s been a prophecy too. It said that the whole world would learn about artifacts once something called the Great Tomb Appearance occurred.”</p>
 <p>He was clearly talking about the Future Diary. And Ju-Heon who remembered the Future Diary’s copy version word for word started to laugh.</p>
 <p>“And?”<br>“It said I needed to get rid of as many people who know about artifacts as possible if I want to prevent that Great Tomb Appearance. So I'm going to need all of you to disappear.”</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon who had the knife at Chairman Kwon’s neck started to sneer.</p>
 <p>"Do you think you’ll be faster or I'll be faster?”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon still looked relaxed as if he was using a defensive artifact.</p>
 <p>"Do it if you can do it in a place like this with CCTVs all around us. It doesn't look like you have any great artifacts anyways.”<br>“Hyu, hyung-nim!”<br>“Watch out!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon then said something and activated one of his artifacts.</p>
 <p>“Kamikakushi (神隠し Mysterious Disappearance). All of you, become a god’s slaves.”</p>
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group started to scream and fell to the ground as soon as he finished speaking. They weren’t certain but it looked as if they might end up like Lee Jin-A!</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>“!”</p>
 <p>Huh?</p>
 <p>Nothing was happening. Nothing happened for a long time after he finished speaking.</p>
 <p>The Oh Seung Woo group finally decided to open one eye and peek. They could see Chairman Kwon who seemed to be as shocked as they were.</p>
 <p>And lo and behold, he started to shout.</p>
 <p>“Kamikakushi!”</p>
 <p>A shocked Chairman Kwon then put his hand in his pocket. He then became extremely anxious.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon started to laugh while standing behind Chairman Kwon at that moment.</p>
 <p>"Are you looking for this?”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon was opening something and shaking it around as if to provoke Chairman Kwon. He was shaking Chairman Kwon’s wallet. There was something that looked like a train ticket inside the black men’s wallet. People who had no idea would think it was a train ticket, but this was an artifact.</p>
 <p>[A lonely god’s invitation (SS-Grade - Divine-Grade / Consumable Artifact)]</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Remaining Uses (43/50)</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The effects of this artifact were as the name Kamikakushi mentioned, mysteriously disappearing from this world after being captured by a god. This was one of Chairman Kwon's first-rate artifacts.</p>
 <p>‘Did you think I wouldn't know you would use this?’</p>
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon had used the knife to pretend to threaten Chairman Kwon in order to draw his focus to the knife before he moved his hands.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Chairman Kwon seemed to be extremely shocked after seeing Ju-Heon's ghost-like dexterity for the first time. Ju-Heon smiled after seeing that reaction.</p>
 <p>‘It’s the skill you complimented the most, you old bastard.’</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>[The Dexterity skill has risen to D-rank!]<br>[You have received the title of &lt; Dexterity that shocked even the gods &gt; and the user’s level information has changed.]</p>
 <p>[Tomb Raider Seo Ju-Heon]<br>Level 2.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A Tomb Raider who doesn't raid any tombs and only increases his thieving skills</li>
 </ul>
 <p>[You have learned the skill, &lt; Hand of a Thief &gt;.]</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon laughed in shock but it didn’t matter much. He wouldn't be able to use it right away because it was a Divine-Grade artifact, but he had managed to steal one of Chairman Kwon’s first-rate artifacts.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>‘I didn’t manage to steal his armor artifact or his conquest artifact.’</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t care much about it. No matter how great Ju-Heon’s dexterity was for his scam-like pickpocket skills, he couldn't steal something a person was wearing underneath or something he had no idea about its appearance.</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon wouldn't try to use his conquest artifact right now anyway. It had a significant penalty and using that would turn this area into ashes. It would be the artifact Chairman Kwon wanted to avoid using the most right now because he didn't want others to find out about artifacts.</p>
 <p>It happened at that moment.</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to laugh.</p>
 <p>“You’re looking down on me too much.”</p>
 <p>He had decided that it was better to get rid of this bastard now even if this would turn into a big deal if he was going to lose his artifact.</p>
 <p>“I will definitely make you pay for your foolishness.”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon just needed to make sure that Great Tomb Appearance didn't happen. Everything else could be covered up. The moment he made that decision and was about to activate his artifact…</p>
 <p>That bastard appeared.<br>He showed up with black feather falling off him like snow and looking down with a domineering gaze at the humans.</p>
 <p>[The human over there. Immediately retract your conquest artifact. Otherwise, an evil jackal that wishes to harm humans will awaken.]</p>
 <p>A haggard crow landed on a high spot at the airport. The crow who finished warning Chairman Kwon then seemed to make eye contact with Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Chairman Kwon who noticed that the crow was an artifact was quite shocked.</p>
 <p>‘It’s not a normal artifact.’</p>
 <p>He could tell at first glance. It seemed to be stronger than the regular Divine-Grade artifacts. That was why Chairman Kwon’s eyes filled with greed. He looked as crazed as a person who found a piece of bread right before they died of starvation. This was an artifact that was giving off so much magical aura that it caused anybody who looked at it to fill with greed. It was to the point that even the Oh Seung Woo group who did not know much about artifacts became bewitched.</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon alone remained calm and focused on what the crow just said.</p>
 <p>‘A jackal?<br>Is he talking about the God of Death Anubis's artifact?<br>Was that bastard’s tomb resting inside the airport?’</p>
 <p>That bastard was definitely one of the strongest and most useful Divine-Grade artifacts. That was why Ju-Heon's eyes sparkled.</p>
 <p>However, Chairman Kwon's hands started to shake as he looked at the crow while Ju-Heon was having those thoughts.</p>
 <p>‘I need to make that mine.’</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon who became greedy for the crow started to laugh with confidence.</p>
 <p>“How perfect. I will take care of you guys and take that for myself as well!”</p>
 <p>The conquest artifact was able to force other artifacts to submit.</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon soon activated the conquest artifact at the behest of the crow's warning and the crow started to coldly glare at him with a condemning gaze.</p>
 <p>[How foolish.]</p>
 <p>It was at that moment. A terrible aura blasted out of the airport.<br>At the same time…</p>
 <p>[Warning. A serious Egyptian virus is trying to enter your body.]<br>[Warning. Your artifacts are starting to be destroyed by very strong &lt; Death Attribute &gt; artifacts.]<br>[Very strong artifacts with murderous intent are headed this way.]<br>Very strong artifacts that can call forth great disasters are headed this way.]<br>[Please prepare an artifact or a plan to deal with them. There are no artifacts or humans who could handle these artifacts with their bodies alone.]</p>
 <p>A bright light that transcended all expectations blasted out of the airport and a large Tomb Appearance happened in Las Vegas.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Go to the underground arena of greed in the first month of the year. That is where the great evil, the ill omen will start.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>It was as the Future Diary described.</p>
 <p>This was the Great Tomb Appearance, the thing that Chairman Kwon wanted to make sure didn't happen. In the end, Chairman Kwon had made a stupid mistake to make it happen.</p>
 <p>Of course, there did seem to be someone here who seemed to benefit from his mistake.</p>
 <p>[Tolerance has increased after being attacked by a violent artifact.]<br>[Tolerance has increased after being attacked by a violent artifact.]<br>[Tolerance has increased after being attacked by a violent artifact.]<br>[Tolerance has increased after being attacked by a violent artifact.]<br>[Tolerance has increased after being attacked by a violent artifact.]<br>[The tolerance skill’s level has increased.]</p>
 <p>[You are now able to bravely stand in front of Divine-Grade artifacts.]</p>
 <p>It was an extremely great benefit.</p>
