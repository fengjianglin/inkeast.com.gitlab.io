<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Ju-Heon and Chairman Kwon had raised their hands at the same time. Ju-Heon glared at Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>‘Tsk, does he know about this item?’</p>
 <p>The item that appeared was a tree seedling.</p>
 <p>However, this item was definitely an artifact.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was an SS-Grade(Divine-Grade) artifact!</p>
 <p>‘Qin Shi Huang's Herb of Eternal Youth!’</p>
 <p>It was the healing artifact that Chairman Kwon possessed in the past.</p>
 <p>[@($&amp;<em>@#&amp;</em>@#!!]</p>
 <p>The Herb of Eternal Youth on the stage was crying about how the spotlight was too hot and what not but Ju-Heon did not care.</p>
 <p>This was one of the main reasons too many individuals signed slave contracts to work under Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>It was one of the important artifacts that helped Chairman Kwon increase his power.</p>
 <p>‘So I need to make sure to get my hands on this one.’</p>
 <p>Getting this would completely change the future.</p>
 <p>The auctioneer started to auction quite happily, probably because this was an event auction item.</p>
 <p>"This is an extremely rare item that has even been discussed in the press!”</p>
 <p>The auctioneer was excitedly chatting away but Ju-Heon's insides were boiling.</p>
 <p>‘Enough! Enough explaining and take my bid!’</p>
 <p>However, the auctioneer mischievously smiled and shouted at that moment.</p>
 <p>“Can you believe it? This almond fruit hanging on this seedling is supposedly great for a man's vigor! The press was quite descriptive of different Hollywood stars and their sexcapades!”</p>
 <p>Everyone looked toward Ju-Heon and Chairman Kwon at that moment.</p>
 <p>‘S, sexual enhancer?’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon felt embarrassed at everyone looking at him but it did not matter.</p>
 <p>‘That is an artifact. That is an artifact.’</p>
 <p>The auctioneer finally said what Ju-Heon was waiting for as he stood there awkwardly with his hand up.</p>
 <p>“We will start the bidding for this plant of passion at $200,000 (200 million won)!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon quickly shouted at that moment.</p>
 <p>“$300,000!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon shouted as well.</p>
 <p>“$400,000!”</p>
 <p>However, other people started to get interested and raised the prices as well.</p>
 <p>“$500,000!”<br>$505,000!<br>“$800,000!”<br>“$1,000,000!”<br>“$1,500,000!”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon soon started to smile.</p>
 <p>‘It’s fine. I have enough money to win this bid.’</p>
 <p>He had 50 million dollars left (50 billion won).</p>
 <p>Most event auctions ended at 3 million dollars (3.3 billion won) at max. <span id="footnote-ref-deb1"><a href="#footnote-deb1">[1]</a></span><br>Cheapskate Chairman Kwon would never invest more than that amount.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>“10 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon had significantly raised the price. Ju-Heon flinched before peeking toward Chairman Kwon.</p>
 <p>‘That bastard is planning on taking that at all costs.’</p>
 <p>Of course, Ju-Heon had no way of knowing if Chairman Kwon knew the true identity of the Herb of Eternal Youth.</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon had no intentions of giving up either. He managed to win other artifacts before they ended up in Chairman Kwon’s hands but then lose out on this Herb of Eternal Youth, a Divine-Grade artifact? How stupid would that be?</p>
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon quickly raised the price again.</p>
 <p>“12 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>Other competitors soon joined Chairman Kwon and Ju-Heon. The bidding turned oddly fervent with people believing that this was an extremely effective sexual enhancer because of Chairman Kwon and Ju-Heon's bidding.</p>
 <p>“We must earn that, 13 million dollars!”<br>“14 million!”<br>“18 million!”<br>“19 million!”</p>
 <p>However, Chairman Kwon significantly raised the price once more at this moment.</p>
 <p>“40 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>People flinched.</p>
 <p>An event auction item ended up reaching this high in price!</p>
 <p>People became interested and the auctioneer seemed extremely happy.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Ju-Heon started to frown.</p>
 <p>‘40 million dollars…’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon thought for a moment before whispering something to Irene. Irene looked toward Ju-Heon in shock after hearing what he had to say.</p>
 <p>But Ju-Heon soon raised his hand again.</p>
 <p>“41 million!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon started to frown and continued to shout as Ju-Heon persistently kept up with him.</p>
 <p>“42 million!”<br>“43 million!”<br>“44 million!”<br>“45 million!”</p>
 <p>The others who felt burdened by the high amount slowly grumbled and fell off.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon and Chairman Kwon were the only ones remaining.</p>
 <p>“47 million!”<br>“48 million!”</p>
 <p>The fierce bidding battle continued until it reached 50 million dollars. 50 million was Ju-Heon's total wealth.</p>
 <p>“Yes sir, we are currently at 50 million dollars. Is there anyone who would like to make another bid?”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon who was annoyed at Ju-Heon's persistence shouted a large number once again.</p>
 <p>“100 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>People started to whisper after hearing the price jump once again.</p>
 <p>“1, 100 million dollars?”<br>“Is he crazy?”</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon who could no longer outbid him was laughing as if it was funny.</p>
 <p>‘For that cheapskate to reach the hundred million level again.’</p>
 <p>He had to accept the truth right now. Ju-Heon and Chairman Kwon had a significant difference in wealth right now.</p>
 <p>TKBM was not some local mom and pop type of company.</p>
 <p>It was one of the top companies for computers, cell phones and other IT technology, a global company that has its hand in a plethora of different fields. Since he was not just a figurehead CEO of such a company, it was only natural that he had more money than Ju-Heon to spend.</p>
 <p>Was that the reason?</p>
 <p>‘He shouldn't be able to even dream about winning this bid anymore.’</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon and Yoon Shi Woo sneered at Ju-Heon after seeing him not place any more bids.</p>
 <p>‘This is why a crow-tit shouldn’t try to keep up with a stork.’ <span id="footnote-ref-1c65"><a href="#footnote-1c65">[2]</a></span></p>
 <p>It was his fault that someone in the normal seats were bidding against them.</p>
 <p>‘I will take that artifact.’</p>
 <p>It happened as Chairman Kwon had that thought and sneered Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>“Okay, if there are no more bids we will…!”</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>‘Huh?’</p>
 <p>Someone raised their hand.</p>
 <p>“150 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>That person raised the price higher than Chairman Kwon as if it was nothing!</p>
 <p>Thanks to that, Chairman Kwon and Yoon Shi Woo could not help but become anxious.</p>
 <p>‘W, what?’</p>
 <p>However, Ju-Heon was not the one to bid this time. The one to bid was Irene, the person sitting next to Ju-Heon.</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo glared at Irene who poured ashes on their finished meal.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, what the hell is wrong with that woman?!”</p>
 <p>‘What’s wrong with her?</p>
 <p>She’s my black knight, no, my black rose.’</p>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju-Heon</span> started to smile.</p>
 <p>He had already talked to Irene once the bid went past 40 million dollars.</p>
 <p>It had been obvious he would lose if it continued at that pace.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon had quickly whispered to her as he knew that would be the case.</p>
 <p>“I will sell you my luck.”</p>
 <p>That was what he told her.</p>
 <p>However, he had added on a condition.</p>
 <p>‘However, I will only trade you for it. I will give you my luck so please give me that item.’</p>
 <p>Did she understand what Ju-Heon was trying to say?</p>
 <p>She had attacked Chairman Kwon at the perfect time.</p>
 <p>“Uhh, then we will continue the bidding. 150 million dollars! Do we have any other bids?”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon and Yoon Shi Woo flinched after hearing this price.</p>
 <p>“150 million dollars…”<br>“Ugh.”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon smiled wickedly while looking at them.</p>
 <p>‘You get it now? No matter how great you think you are, you're shit compared to the Holten family.’</p>
 <hr>
 <p>Chairman Kwon was quite anxious right now.</p>
 <p>“160 million dollars!”<br>“200 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>It was because there was a woman who persistently continued to bid on the item he was about to purchase.</p>
 <p>She seemed to be on Ju-Heon's side.</p>
 <p>However, this woman was easily suppressing Chairman Kwon’s bids as if they were prices of gum when others were busy getting out of the bidding war as he raised the price.</p>
 <p>And once again…</p>
 <p>“220 million dollars!”<br>“300 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>The woman's loud voice echoed through the auction house.</p>
 <p>People started to whisper after hearing the exorbitant bid.</p>
 <p>“My goodness, 300 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon looked toward the woman in shock as well.</p>
 <p>‘Holy hell, is that woman crazy?’</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo's jaws dropped.</p>
 <p>“What kind of crazy woman calls out 300 million dollars for a stupid tree?”</p>
 <p>He seems to have forgotten about how he tried to sell TKBM off for a stupid bottle of wine as he shouted in anger for someone to bring him some binoculars.</p>
 <p>She was definitely Ju-Heon's ally as they seemed to be discussing something.</p>
 <p>‘That bastard.’</p>
 <p>Just when he thought this bug stopped being persistent and backed off…</p>
 <p>“What kind of bitch did he drag into this…?!”</p>
 <p>However, his expression turned pale after confirming the woman's face with the binoculars.</p>
 <p>‘T, that woman is…!’”</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Chairman Kwon was checking his free cash flow as he gave his secretary an order.</p>
 <p>‘I can’t give up like this.’</p>
 <p>“Try pulling about 5,000 more.”<br>“Ah Yes, yes sir!”</p>
 <p>However, at that moment…</p>
 <p>“C, Chairman-nim.”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo called out to Chairman Kwon in a stiff voice.</p>
 <p>“Umm. I, I think it is best that you give up.”<br>“What?!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon became angry but Yoon Shi Woo was serious. He would usually not say anything about Chairman Kwon’s actions, but this situation was different.</p>
 <p>“That…if I'm not mistaken, she is the youngest daughter of the Holten household from the United States.”<br>“What?!”</p>
 <p>Yoon Shi Woo knew what they were up against.</p>
 <p>He knew how much wealth Irene, the youngest daughter of the Holten household had, as well as how crazy the Holten household who were said to be as rich as some royal families were said to be.</p>
 <p>‘Even the Chairman-nim cannot defeat that family's wealth.’</p>
 <p>The Holten household was a noble household who had originated in England and crossed over to the US in the past. Their wealth was built on finance but their reach extended to other businesses as well.</p>
 <p>As for Irene Holten?</p>
 <p>According to rumors, the entire family loved Irene so much that they would chase anybody who harmed Irene in any way to the ends of the earth to destroy them.</p>
 <p>‘It’s better not to get tangled up with that woman.’</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter what kind of relationship Ju-Heon had with that woman.</p>
 <p>"C, Chairman-nim, why don't you just give up on that…!”</p>
 <p>Even Chairman Kwon had a limit to how much money he could spend at once. He was already reaching a dangerous level.</p>
 <p>However, Chairman Kwon raised his number again.</p>
 <p>“320 million dollars!”<br>“C, Chairman-nim!”</p>
 <p>Chairman Kwon knew he needed to win this almost seedling no matter what anybody said.</p>
 <p>‘That's an artifact I must have.’</p>
 <p>However, Yoon Shi Woo who had no idea what Chairman Kwon was thinking couldn't help but become anxious.</p>
 <p>How could he bid over 300 million dollars for a sexual enhancer?!</p>
 <p>‘Did the Chairman want another heir that badly?’</p>
 <p>“C, Chairman-nim! Please stop…!”<br>“Will you shut the hell up?”</p>
 <p>However, it was at that moment.</p>
 <p>Irene landed a heavy blow, as if she was telling them to get lost.</p>
 <p>“500 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>‘That’s crazy!’</p>
 <p>Silence soon filled the auction house. However, Ju-Heon and Irene who called out that price were smiling.</p>
 <p>‘Alright, be a good boy and stop bidding. Chairman Kwon.’</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon was able to estimate how much money Chairman Kwon was able to use right now.</p>
 <p>‘You guys can’t beat the Holten household right now even if all of you gathered your money together.’</p>
 <p>Did he manage to read Ju-Heon’s smile? Chairman Kwon glared at them before throwing his number to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Damn it!”</p>
 <p>And then, after that…</p>
 <p>“T, then this sexual enhan……no, no, this rare almond tree seedling has been sold for 500 million dollars!”</p>
 <p>Everybody in the auction house shouted in shock at that moment.</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon was shocked as well.</p>
 <p>500 million dollars were approximately 500 billion won.</p>
 <p>That was why Ju-Heon had to ask a question to confirm even though he was happy to have won the item.</p>
 <p>“500 million dollars, isn't that too excessive?”</p>
 <p>However, Irene's response was quite clear.</p>
 <p>“It's fine. The random stuff I put on the market recently sold for 600 million dollars a few days ago. In addition.”</p>
 <p>She continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“You are going to sell me your luck. That is more important to me than any amount of money.”</p>
 <p>Money wasn't important to her at all. She just wanted to stop bringing misfortune to her loving family.</p>
 <p>That was why Irene happily paid such a large amount for this.</p>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju-Heon</span> started to smile at that response.</p>
 <p>‘Irene Holten. She’s definitely a woman who can help me.’</p>
 <p>He was extremely happy that he was able to see such an expression on Chairman Kwon’s face as well.</p>
 <p>“Now please give me your luck. Is it some kind of Asian talisman……or something like a rabbit’s foot?”</p>
 <p>Ju-Heon laughed before responding to that question.</p>
