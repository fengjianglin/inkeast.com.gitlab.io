That golden spear was something that even Sixth Grade Sovereigns would be fearful of upon seeing it.</span></p>

Its fundamental Sovereign Ability was the Nine Solar Energy. Making use of unleashing the power of nine suns to amplify its fighting powers.</span></p>

However, the requirement to use them was extremely harsh, which was the gradual cultivation of the Nine Solar Energy, step by step.</span></p>

Only when he managed to grasp the Nine Solar Energy fully, could he be able to see the peak of the mountain, in which Mu Chen was full of expectations towards that…</span></p>

Mu Chen took in a deep breath to suppress his surging heart, before raising his head. There were two beams that flew over like dragons from Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince.</span></p>

But facing the terrifying attacks of those two, Mu Chen had only lifted a smile on his face.</span></p>

Looking from afar, it looked like genuine five suns that emanated an endless pressure.</span></p>

A horrifying golden mist wave surged as a blazing shock wave spread out that even burned the atmosphere…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the explosion of the five suns, the golden lustre on the Five Solar Spear had grown to an extremely powerful height before turning into a golden beam of light that’s a few thousand feet as it whistled out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That golden beam was too powerful and the energy contained in it was so violent that it made others startled. In the distance, the Sleeping Emperor, Sky Vulture Emperor and the other peak experts also had a slight change in their expressions.</span></p>

But in the next instant, both of their faces had turned extremely ugly as they saw the beams of light that they had created with all their strength only lasting for a few breaths of time before they were destroyed by the golden beam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack.</span></p>

The golden beam split into two and shot towards the two’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an aura of death blew in their faces, the both of them had their faces filled with fear and they understood from the golden beams that if they were struck by it, they would definitely be killed!</span></p>

As they retreated, the Sovereign Celestial Bodies beneath them had pounced forth, using their massive figures to clash with the golden beams. The two of them were decisive characters. Although they would be gravely injured with the destruction of their Sovereign Celestial Bodies, it was still better than them confronting them with their bodies. Their bodies weren’t like Mu Chen’s, which was like a humanoid Divine Beast’s. If they clashed with the two beams of light, they would definitely be killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

Instantly, a huge rumbling noise resounded. As the golden lights spreads out, everyone could clearly see cracks swiftly spreading out on the two Sovereign Celestial Bodies, with the golden light shooting out from those cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Their auras were weak and they had actually fainted on the spot. Clearly, the two of them had been gravely injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The commotion caused by Mu Chen was too great. In terms of generation, the three of them were pinnacle elites amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region. However, the commotion caused by their confrontation was actually greater than the Sleeping Emperor and East Pavilion Lord that possessed the cultivation of Ninth Grade Sovereign Realm experts. Naturally, that was also because their Spiritual Energies were suppressed in the rock island, but the commotion from those three had still attracted everyone’s attention over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu and Su Biyue, who had paid attention to Mu Chen’s fight the whole time, had inhaled mouthfuls of cold air when they saw that the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi had fainted. They had witnessed the entire process of the two of them being utterly defeated…</span></p>

They had initially thought that Mu Chen was already very capable to be able to hold up against the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi. But no one had expected that Mu Chen would utterly crush the two of them…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow is getting more and more terrifying…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu and Su Biyue inwardly sighed. Back in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, Mu Chen had only managed to hold the Netherworld Prince back with all his force. But right now, not even the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi were his opponents. Who could predict how high Mu Chen would reach in a few years time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had shock in their eyes. However, Mu Chen’s gaze was still fixed onto the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi as he flicked his finger. Two beams of Spiritual Energy shot forth towards the two of their heads. Judging from the looks of it, Mu Chen was clearly intending to remove the roots of trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if Mu Chen was decisive with his move, two light silhouettes had appeared before the two of them before the Spiritual Energy beams struck them, waving their sleeves as they shattered the two beams of Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had slightly frowned his brows upon seeing this sight. The two were Sixth Grade Sovereigns of the Netherworld Palace and Divine Pavilion. It looked like those fellows had already intended to protect the two of them right from the start and wouldn’t let him kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Sixth Grade Sovereigns had saved the two of them, but they did not make a move. Looking towards Mu Chen, there wasn’t any underestimation in their eyes, like they had in the past. Instead, it was replaced with a dense fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because even they weren’t confident that they could defeat the two of them in that state. But Mu Chen had accomplished it, which implied that the latter had already grown to an extent that was comparable to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the two of them had merely saved the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi before immediately retreating, fearing that Mu Chen would make a move towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw how swift they had acted, he smiled and did not pursue. The both of them had previously used secret techniques and were also injured to this state by him. It would definitely leave behind a serious repercussion, so even if they were saved, their strength would experience a halt. By the time they fully recovered, Mu Chen would have already exceeded the both of them…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen retracted his gaze as he looked at the centre of the lake. When he fought with the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi, many of the light lumps had been taken. But evidently, no one had gotten the Spiritual Divine Liquid. Otherwise, it would have already caused a huge commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So the Spiritual Divine Liquid is still here…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stared at those lumps of light. There were only five that remained with extremely radiant lustres. The speed of those five were extremely fast and there were many experts trying to capture those five, but their efforts were futile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stared at those five. But just when he wanted to sense the items in the lights, his heart suddenly shook and he clenched his hand, then a black object appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the triangle black metal object that he had previously obtained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Mu Chen had obtained this, there weren’t any movements that came from this mysterious object. But at this moment, it had actually started to heat up…</span></p>
