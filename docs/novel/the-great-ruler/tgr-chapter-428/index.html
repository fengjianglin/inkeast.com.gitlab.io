 <p><strong>Chapter 428 - Bullying My Son</strong></p>
 <p>“Did you think that a measly First Grade Sovereign can harm my son?!”</p>
 <p>As the gentle voice that brought along a sliver of fury reverberated across the entire world, shock filled the hearts of everyone present, especially after sensing the Spiritual Energy fluctuations that had flared up all of a sudden across this entire region. Even the faces of the various big shots violently contorted, their eyes brimming with shock as they stared at the figure of the lady that had taken shape within the brilliance.</p>
 <p>From there, they were able to feel an indescribable pressure and might.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a furious shiver shook through the body of Mu Chen. He was originally in the process of forcefully summoning Nine Nether, who was halfway through her evolution. Turning his head around, he blankly stared at the figure of the lady condensed within the rays of brilliance. The figure started to overlap with the warm and gentle silhouette within the deepest part of his memories. Ever since he had started to remember things, he had yet to see that figure again. Nevertheless, the warm and gentle figure within the deepest part of his memories was just like a brand, never fading away. The brand that originated from his bloodline was something that couldn’t be erased, no matter how much time had elapsed.</p>
 <p>“Mother?”</p>
 <p>While in a somewhat vacant state, Mu Chen muttered out a single word, his voice sounded exceedingly hoarse and astringent, with a slight shakiness to it. It appeared as if he didn’t dare to believe that the figure he had bitterly searched for had actually appeared here, right in front of him.</p>
 <p>Only God knows how many times this figure appeared within his dreams. Ever since he's young, his dad would force him to diligently train and cultivate. When he was naughty and slacked off, he would get a bout of backside slaps from his dad. While bawling after the scoldings, a warm and gentle figure seemed to appear by his side, appearing flustered as she consoled the little him. At those moments, her warm and gentle voice would seep right into his heart.</p>
 <p>Today, at long last, the figure within his dreams had truly appeared before his eyes…</p>
 <p>A complicated and indescribable feeling gushed out from Mu Chen’s heart, like a flood, causing the eyes of the ever-so resilient youth to turn red.</p>
 <p>While Mu Chen was lost in thought from seeing the figure of the lady, Ling Xi, who was in the process of an intense fight with Liu An, suddenly turned stiff. Turning her head around, she looked in complete disbelief at the exceedingly familiar figure that had appeared in her sight. In the next moment, her eyes turned red, before slashes of tears started to flow down her beautiful face.</p>
 <p>“Aunt Jing.”</p>
 <p>Although she had lost quite a bit of her memories, the figure before her eyes was the most important person in her life. When she was brought out from that hell-like place, Ling Xi knew that the importance of that figure superseded her own life.</p>
 <p>Seeing Ling Xi coming to a stop, Liu An breathed a sigh of relief. Ling Xi seemed to be in an unstable state of emotion, making it a good opportunity for him to take action. Nevertheless, he hesitated for a while and did not take advantage of it; afterall, he didn’t have any grudge against her, nor was she included in his contract with the Demonic Dragon Palace. They had only requested for him to take action once. In such a circumstance, its best to make it as simple as possible, as he didn’t wish to risk everything, including his life for the Demonic Dragon Palace.</p>
 <p>Liu An slightly turned his head to look towards the figure of the lady, which had appeared out of nowhere, yet caused the hearts of the people to palpitate in shock. A frown appeared on his forehead as he thought, <em>That shouldn’t be a physical body. That’s a spiritual form.</em> Nevertheless, even though it was just a spiritual form, he could faintly discern, with a feeling of unease, that the lady before him might not be someone with a simple background.</p>
 <p>An unforeseen change might have happened to this entire situation.</p>
 <p>As countless people in the region looked over in shock at the beautiful figure that had condensed from the rays of blossoming light, the figure slowly lifted up her hand. With a gentle wave, the gigantic thousand metre large Spiritual Energy palm pressing down on Mu Chen suddenly froze up. In the next instant, cracks started to appear on it, and with a final loud bang, it transformed into glowing dots that blotted the skies.</p>
 <p>With a single wave of her hand, the tyrannical attack of a First Grade Sovereign was instantly dispelled!</p>
 <p>As this spectacle happened, even experts on the level of Xia Tianyan had their pupils furiously contracting in shock.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?!”</p>
 <p>The furious roar of the Yellow Dragon Sovereign rang across the horizon as he stared towards the beautiful figure amongst the brilliance in shock. Although the previous attack he had sent out wasn’t his full power, it was impossible for anyone to break it as easily as she did. <em>Exactly where did this mysterious lady come from?! Did she say that he was her son?! Could it be that she’s the mother of that brat?!</em></p>
 <p>“Your distinguished self, that smelly brat, Mu Chen, has stolen the treasure of our Demonic Dragon Palace. If he’s your son, you can take him away, and we won’t trouble you. He just has to return our treasure!” said the Yellow Dragon Sovereign in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t an idiot. He felt extreme danger from the mysterious lady before him. If she was to become his enemy, it would deal a serious blow towards the plans of their Demonic Dragon Palace.</p>
 <p>“You’ve hurt my child! Even the entire Demonic Dragon Palace isn’t enough to compensate for that!”</p>
 <p>The lady’s gentle voice had now turned into one of extreme fury and anger. With a raise of her hand, inexhaustible black light started to condense in her palm. With a whoosh, it transformed into an extremely exquisite black-coloured pagoda. From the looks of it, the black pagoda was completely identical to the Nine-Layered Pagoda that Mu Chen had just summoned moments ago. Shooting into the sky, gales started to howl as it dramatically expanded in size. As the air rumbled, the entire region appeared to turn dim as to black pagoda grew to a size of thousands of metres in length. Akin to a meteor, it hovered in the air, its shadow shrouding over the entire region below it.</p>
 <p>Spiritual Energy exploded throughout the entire region, condensing into gigantic tornadoes in the surroundings of the black pagoda.</p>
 <p>This frightening commotion caused the face of the Yellow Dragon Sovereign to violently contort, as he could sense extremely dangerous fluctuations radiating from the black pagoda. In the next instant, with a loud roar, a gigantic thousand metre large Sovereign’s Celestial Body condensed behind him. This entire Celestial Body was in a blackish-yellow colour, appearing as if it was cast from gold, giving people a feeling of indestructibility.</p>
 <p>This was the “Heavenly Golden Celestial Body” that was the pride of the Yellow Dragon Sovereign. This was the cultivation result of harnessing the Heavenly Golden Smelting Spiritual Energy found in the clouds, tempering it with a unique Celestial Body Divine Art, Although this “Heavenly Golden Celestial Body” wasn’t within the list of the top 99 Sovereign Celestial Bodies, it was much more tyrannical than any normal Sovereign Celestial Body. While he was only a First Grade Sovereign, the Yellow Dragon Sovereign was able to contend against a Second Grade Sovereign, all thanks to the “Heavenly Gold Celestial Body” that he had cultivated.</p>
 <p>The situation now had clearly caused the Yellow Dragon Sovereign to feel an enormous threat. Therefore, without the slightest hesitation, he had brought out his greatest card.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Despite that, not giving a single care, the black pagoda immediately suppressed the jet black rays of brilliance radiating from the Heavenly Golden Celestial Body. Like a black hole, it started to revolve, howling about as it descended down, enveloping the Yellow Dragon Sovereign and his “Heavenly Golden Celestial Body” within it.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A myriad of golden light erupted from the black pagoda and the roars of countless dragons resounded. In the next moment, all of the experts present in the region were overwhelmed with shock to see hundreds of giant golden dragons flying around above the black pagoda. Transforming into a golden-coloured flame, they rushed into the pagoda, hiding the earth and covering the skies as they encased the blackish-gold Celestial Body within. Surging forth and flaring out, they appeared to start their refinement of their captured target.</p>
 <p>As the golden flames surged forth, the Yellow Dragon Sovereign was overwhelmed with shock and terror to see that his “Heavenly Golden Celestial Body”, which could even stand up against a Second Grade Sovereign, was unexpectedly melting away at an astonishing speed.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Brimming with terror, he hastily urged his Heavenly Golden Celestial Body to violently attack against the inner walls of the pagoda. However, despite his rampant attacks, the black pagoda didn’t budge a single inch. Clearly, this black pagoda wasn’t something that the little toy Mu Chen brought out could compare with.</p>
 <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>
 <p>As they swept around within the pagoda, the golden flames quickly melted the Heavenly Golden Celestial Body away. In a short span of a dozen breaths, chills went down the spines of countless experts as they saw that the Heavenly Golden Celestial Body had been completely melted. Now, the Yellow Dragon Sovereign was left exposed against the raging golden flames with not a single defense present on his body.</p>
 <p>As the golden flames wiggled and squirmed about, they transformed into a hundred giant golden dragons. Swimming around slowly, they malevolently stared at the Yellow Dragon Sovereign. In the next instant, spreading their gigantic bodies out, they swooped down towards him.</p>
 <p>Urghh!</p>
 <p>The Yellow Dragon Sovereign howled out as boundless Spiritual Energy erupted from his body. Various powerful attacks endlessly rumbled out of him; various Spirit Weapons were tossed out without a single care. Nevertheless, despite his rampant attacks, the giant golden dragons didn’t budge a single bit. As golden flames flared out around their bodies, frightening Spiritual Energy currents howled out. At the instant when they made contact with his body, the Yellow Dragon Sovereign was immediately consumed by the surging golden flames.</p>
 <p>Arghhhh!</p>
 <p>This time, what rang out was an extremely miserable shriek as the Yellow Dragon Sovereign was covered by the golden flames, while his powerful body had started to combust.</p>
 <p>Looking at the Yellow Dragon Sovereign being engulfed in the golden flames, and yet was unable to escape from them, Xia Tianyan and the other experts felt cold sweat dripping down their backs. <em>Exactly what kind of skill is this? It’s actually that overbearing! It had directly melted a Sovereign’s Celestial Body away! From the looks of it, it also wanted to melt the Yellow Dragon Sovereign away!</em></p>
 <p>The Yellow Dragon Sovereign’s shrieks grew increasingly mournful. Clearly, he was quickly unable to endure for much longer.</p>
 <p>“Please stay your hand, your distinguished self. If there’s any area that we’ve offended you, our Demonic Dragon Palace is willing to compensate you in any way. Please forgive and let the Yellow Dragon Sovereign go!”</p>
 <p>As Yellow Dragon Sovereign was quickly about to be refined, a loud roar finally rang out from the distance. Turning around, everyone saw the Black Dragon Sovereign shooting over. At this moment, an abnormally ugly expression hung from his face. Originally, Dean Tai Cang would almost be unable to endure for much longer. He never imagined that out of the blue, such a frightening fiend would appear.</p>
 <p>In such a short moment, she had almost refined the Yellow Dragon Sovereign.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, faced against his roar, the lady within the blossoming light didn’t show any signs of stopping. As the golden flames continued to curl up, the shrieks coming from the Yellow Dragon Sovereign gradually grew weaker and weaker.</p>
 <p>“You’s going too far!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, the Black Dragon Sovereign instantly roared out, sending his killing intent rocketing up to the skies. In a flash, he appeared right in front of the lady. Sending a palm out, the heavens turned dim as hundreds of dragon shadows surged forth, shattering the heavens and earth in their wake.</p>
 <p>This Black Dragon Sovereign was truly worthy of being a Fifth Grade Sovereign. This attack of his clearly revealed a strength that vastly exceeded that of the Yellow Dragon Sovereign. Any action he did was capable of shattering the heavens and the earth.</p>
 <p>Within the brilliance, a jade-like palm extended out. There wasn’t any rampant Spiritual Energy fluctuations present on it, just a single palm patting out. Just like that, it slammed head-on against the exceedingly rampant palm coming from the Black Dragon Sovereign.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As the two palms slammed against each other, an astonishing clap of a thunderous roar resounded out. Cracks appeared in a spherical space tens of thousands of metres around the two as space started to collapse. From a distance, the space appeared like a gigantic piece of shattered glass.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Frightening gales and spatial waves swept out as everyone sucked in a breath of cold air when they saw that the Black Dragon Sovereign had actually been sent flying back thousands of metres by a single palm of the lady. In the next moment, after much difficulty, him managed to stabilize himself, while an inconceivable expression of disbelief appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the entire world seemed to turn quiet.</p>
 <p>The scalps of the various big shots turned numb as they thought, <em>Exactly where did this frightening lady come from?! She’s actually that powerful!</em></p>
 <p>“Arghh!”</p>
 <p>Miserable shrieks continued to ring out, causing people to hastily turn around to see the figure of the Yellow Dragon Sovereign engulfed in golden flames within the black dragon. Finally as the flames flitted across, a loud bang resounded as the body of the Yellow Dragon Sovereign had actually exploded apart.</p>
 <p>However, despite that, there was no bloody mist formed as everything was turned into nihility by the golden flames.</p>
 <p>Therefore, as the golden flames dissipated away, there was not a single thing remaining within the black pagoda.</p>
 <p><em>The Yellow Dragon Sovereign had actually been refined alive!</em></p>
 <p>Seeing this, Xia Tianyan, the Western Extreme Sovereign and the other big shots of the Northern Heavens Continent could not help gulping their saliva down. As their faces turned successively pale, shadows of terror and dread flashed within the depths of their eyes.</p>
 <p><em>Such an overbearing ability!</em></p>
 <p>As silence hung over the entire region, the brilliance started to slowly dissipate away as a gentle figure appeared before the countless shocked and terrified gazes.</p>
 <p>Raising her head, she looked towards the Black Dragon Sovereign in the distance as a chilling voice rang across the world.</p>
 <p>“Since you’ve bullied my son, I’ll bully you. What’s the matter?”</p>
