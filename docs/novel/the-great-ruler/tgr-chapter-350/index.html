 <p><strong>Chapter 350 - Ling Xi</strong></p>
 <p>As the night grew darker, the clear and cold moonlight enveloped the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, even though it was already well into the night, the gigantic spiritual academy was still filled with vitality as figures shot across ceaselessly.</p>
 <p>The Exchange that had ended today had undoubtedly caused the emotions within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to flare up and boil. The scene of the final reversal caused many students to boil and turn restless. Originally, all of them had assumed that they had let the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy get the long end of the stick. Although a loss like that would not let people assume that their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was no longer capable, those slanderous rumors would always raise the ire of people.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen had returned and defeated the strongest student from the opposite side with an immensely strong attack. This kind of reversal caused many students from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to feel exceedingly elated and inspired. Naturally, relying on this fight, Mu Chen’s 3rd Rank on the Heavenly Rankings had already become impossible to shake. There were even some students that estimated, and were shocked to discover, that the current Mu Chen had already started to gradually catch up to Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>According to the rate of Mu Chen’s increased strength, perhaps it wouldn't take too long before the 3rd Rank on the Heavenly Rankings to take a shift forward. This might even happen before a year’s worth of time… There was even the possibly of him rushing towards the Overlord’s Rank within the Heavenly Rankings that was guarded by Shen Cangsheng after so many years.</p>
 <p>At that time, there would definitely be an incomparably spectacular fight between tigers and dragons.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Within the little building in the Freshmen Area, a young girl was standing elegantly. Clasping the black longsword in her jade-like hands, Luo Li’s gaze was focused on it, while one could notice the absent-mindedness present within her eyes. After quite a long time, she gave a faint sigh.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter?” A low and gentle voice rang out behind her as Mu Chen extended his arm around the young girl’s slender waist.</p>
 <p>“Looks like the news about me leaving the Luo God Clan is already spreading.” replied Luo Li as she gently leaned within Mu Chen’s bosom, while her eyebrows started to faintly knit together. If her grandfather, Luo Tianshen, was to know about this matter, the time of their agreement might be immediately brought forward.</p>
 <p>She was the Queen of the Luo God Clan, and was the only person within the Luo God Clan that could shoulder them. If some mishap was to even occur to her, the Luo God Clan would truly collapse and be wiped out.</p>
 <p>At that time, the millions of citizens within the Luo God Clan would suffer the ruthless massacre from the other three Great God Clans.</p>
 <p>To the Luo God Clan, she was truly too important.</p>
 <p>Therefore, once that Xue Shi wakes up, he would definitely report this news back to the Blood God Clan. At that time, the Luo God Clan would definitely catch wind of it. Therefore, even if she wanted to conceal this matter, she was unable to conceal it for long.</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, the arm wrapped around Luo Li’s slender waisted tightened, while fury quietly rose within his eyes. If he had known this earlier, he would have truly killed that fellow. Although, he also knew that wanting to kill Xue Shi in front of Fei Qingsong seemed to be an impossible task.</p>
 <p>As Luo Li nestled in Mu Chen’s embrace, her fine and exquisite little face rested against his chest, rubbing her face up and down like a little kitten. She was very clear about the immense pressure that she would have to bear if she were to return to the Luo God Clan once again. This kind of pressure was sufficient to cause an ordinary person to immediately break down and collapse.</p>
 <p>However, the lives and deaths of millions of her citizens were all under her control.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, at that time, she would no longer have such a heartwarming embrace for her to rely on. At that time, the only person she could rely on was herself. At that time, there would no longer be anyone that would feel heartache to the point of feeling more hurt and infuriated whenever she gets bullied.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked towards the delicate and porcelain-like face within his embrace, before starting to turn silent. He knew that the day where they had to part would come. Furthermore, this separation might be for a very long time, with her not having another chance to slip out to find him.</p>
 <p>Before possessing sufficient strength, he was also unable to find her. If he did, not only would he not be able to provide any help to her, he would even become a burden. Although she wouldn’t mind that, obviously, Mu Chen would absolutely not want to see that scene.</p>
 <p>“I’ll accompany you for this period of time.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen let his hand flow through Luo Li’s long silvery-like hair, enjoying the perfect feeling in his palms. Looking up into the sky, he exhaled a long breath of air. <em>Luo Li, I’m already doing everything I can to run along the path of an unrivalled expert. I’ll continue to run like that, all the way to the point where I can truly stand in front of you and shatter anything that blocks you with a single palm of mine!</em></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The next day, after accompanying Luo Li in the Freshmen area for over half a day. This continued till the young girl became slightly angry, and said that he was being too annoying and making her unable to train. Only then did he leave her alone, while feeling hurt that he was actually being ignored and avoided.</p>
 <p>After leaving the Freshmen area, Mu Chen found his bearings and started heading towards the northern side of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. According to Dean Tai Cang, that Elder Ling Xi should be living around there.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen already knew about some information regarding Elder Ling Xi from his conversation with Dean Tai Cang and the others yesterday, the majority coming from Ye Qingling. That’s due to the fact that the Elder that had taken Su’er under her wing was the exact same Elder Ling Xi.</p>
 <p>That Elder stayed deep within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy and rarely went out, and it was extremely rare for students to catch a glimpse of her, with the number of people being able to obtain her guidance on Spiritual Arrays being even less. Within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, if anyone wanted to obtain some guidance from the Elders, one would need extremely high amounts of Spiritual Values. However, this Elder Ling Xi had a completely firm personality. She didn’t even care if one had Spiritual Values, causing countless students to be unable to shed tears, and were helpless without any other alternative.</p>
 <p>In view of this, Mu Chen felt slightly apprehensive about this. This Elder had an overly excessive personality. He didn’t know if the Dean’s words would have any effect…</p>
 <p>Holding onto this apprehension, and after approximately ten minutes, Mu Chen started to descend towards the peak of a cloud-covered mountain. An elegant courtyard stood erect on the summit of the mountain. Clouds lingered around it, giving it an extremely quiet and serene feeling.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen descended before the courtyard, he noticed that the main doors were tightly shut, while there was nobody around to greet him. Making a bitter laugh, he retrieved the jade slip given to him by the Dean yesterday, before saying in a respectful voice, “This student’s name is Mu Chen, and I’ve come on the behest Dean Tai to meet with Elder Ling Xi.”</p>
 <p>Wrapped with Spiritual Energy, Mu Chen’s voice rang out within the quiet and serene courtyard. Nevertheless, there was still no activity present within. Regardless of that, he didn’t get anxious over it. Standing outside of the door, without moving an inch, he held the jade slip out, appearing extremely respectful.</p>
 <p>Within his respectful stance, he waited for nearly half an hour’s worth of time.</p>
 <p>Just as the half an hour mark gradually went by, a ray of light shot out from within the depths of the courtyard. Immediately enveloping the jade slip within Mu Chen’s hands, it retrieved it before heading back. At the same time, the tightly shut courtyard doors started to slowly open, bit by bit.</p>
 <p>Huuu.</p>
 <p>Seeing the courtyard doors open, Mu Chen quietly breathed a sigh of relief. <em>Looks like the Dean’s jade slip has a bit of use. If it didn’t, even if I stood here for an entire day and night, this eccentric Elder wouldn’t even bother with me.</em></p>
 <p>Mu Chen strode forward, crossing over the courtyard doors before walking into the depths.</p>
 <p>Past the courtyard was a secluded and winding small path made of broken stones, with a clear lake by its side. Taking a look at his surroundings, Mu Chen proceeded to follow along this small rocky path.</p>
 <p>And this walk became one that was nearing half an hour’s of time.</p>
 <p>This small rocky path seemed to continue forever without end. Regardless of how Mu Chen walked, he was unable to walk out of it. At this moment, his expression had turned completely solemn. Obviously, he was able to feel the strangeness of this place.</p>
 <p>As his stopped his footsteps and wrinkled his brows tightly, he thought, <em>Is this… to test me?</em></p>
 <p>Taking a look at his surroundings, he gave a flick of his finger, and explosively sent Spiritual Energy shooting out towards every direction. However, without shooting out far into the distance, all of them dissipated in the air. From the looks of it, this region seemed to an isolated space.</p>
 <p>“Is this a Spiritual Array?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen muttered to himself, as he scanned the surroundings around him acutely. Nevertheless, he was unable to discover any fluctuations caused by Spiritual Seals permeating within the air. In this place, there weren’t any traces of Spiritual Arrays.</p>
 <p>After thinking deeply for quite a while, he made a sudden step back.</p>
 <p>Following his step back, the surrounding scene turned slightly illusionary. In the next instant, he discovered that he had appeared at the location where he was right after stepping past the main doors, with the little rocky path in front of him. At his back, the doors of the courtyard were still open, seemingly telling him that if he wasn’t able to head forward, he should immediately turn around and leave.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t walk forward, and he wasn’t willing to turn around and leave.</p>
 <p>Was there a third way for him to walk?</p>
 <p>This place was definitely strange. However, it’s just that Mu Chen had yet to discover it.</p>
 <p>As he thought about it, his eyes faintly narrowed. After a while, his gaze suddenly turned towards the clear lake beside the little rocky path. As his eyes sparkled, he took a step forward, and heavily landed within the lake.</p>
 <p>As his feet descended, there wasn’t any water splashing out. At this instant, Mu Chen’s taut body finally relaxed. <em>Indeed, it’s like that…</em></p>
 <p>Without stopping in his tracks, he walked straight into the lake, causing the lake water to slowly submerge him, bit by bit.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Mu Chen was completely submerged by the lake water, his surroundings seemed to faintly ripple and fluctuate. In the next moment, he started to feel them turn illusionary, with the little rocky path and the lake already dissipating away.</p>
 <p>What appeared before him was an elegant and refined bamboo building, with the words “Ling Xi’s Courtyard” being displayed.</p>
 <p>Elation filled Mu Chen as he could tell that he had passed the slightly strange place.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mu Chen’s gaze turned towards the front of the bamboo building, only to see a beautiful girl dressed in white sitting quietly there. The girl was extremely youthful, with her skin akin to snow, twirling eyebrows with a serene and quiet gaze, while radiating with an icy and indifferent aura that would repel people to a thousand miles away.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing her, Mu Chen instantly gawked, before cupping his hands and saying, “This student…”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish his words, the girl dressed in white gave him an icy glare. With a wave of her jade-like hand, the bamboo door instantly closed shut.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was stunned.</p>
 <p>“Eh, Big Brother Mu Chen?” while Mu Chen was still stunned, a young and happy voice suddenly rang out from behind.</p>
 <p>Turning his head around, the first thing he saw was Su’er, dressed in white, standing right behind him, who currently had her eyes wide open with happiness and surprise as she looked at him.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Mu Chen, why are you here?” asked Su’er happily in surprise.</p>
 <p>Feeling helpless, Mu Chen replied, “I’m here to find Elder Ling Xi to teach me about Spiritual Arrays… however, I didn’t see anyone…”</p>
 <p>“Hasn’t Elder Sister Ling Xi been here all along?” replied Su’er in confusion, as she pointed towards the bamboo building.</p>
 <p>“This place? Elder Sister Ling Xi?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen immediately gawked, before an incredulous feeling erupted out from his eyes as this moment. Staring blankly at the tightly closed bamboo doors, he thought, <em>That beautiful girl in white is that Elder Ling Xi?</em></p>
