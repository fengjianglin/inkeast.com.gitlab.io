A breeze lifted his white clothes, fluttering them, which gave him a confident look, and made those from the other forces to inwardly sigh. Fang Yi did indeed have his breathtaking points to be able to become an elite of the Northern Region’s younger generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, when he had encountered a setback due to Cai Xiao’s appearance, he wasn’t dejected because of it. On the contrary, he used that to examine himself, which made him enhance his strength once again. That kind of tenacious he had to seek a breakthrough during any predicament would make anyone sigh in admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a quality that was essential to true experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under countless gazes, Fang Yi lightly smiled as he looked at Mu Chen. “As long as you can defeat me, my Divine Pavilion will retreat from today’s matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A clamour rang out, because Fang Yi’s words had clearly stated his request to fight Mu Chen, which made others eyes to light up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because the two of them were the most mighty figures amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region. One was someone that’s been an Overlord on the Dragon-Phoenix Record for years, while the other was a dark horse that soared like a comet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them possessed decent fame. Therefore, their confrontation had undoubtedly attracted much attention. That’s because everyone wished to know whether a dark horse like Mu Chen could soar higher after meeting the Overlord of the Dragon-Phoenix Record or if he would fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, comparing the two, Fang Yi had a greater reputation. Therefore, there were people that felt that Fang Yi wasn’t being fair in his suggestion. After all, when his fame resounded in the Northern Region, Mu Chen was still a nobody…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you really think that this situation is a place that you can choose to fight as you wish?” Nine Nether’s gaze turned cold as she sneered. With her strength, she could naturally tell that Fang Yi had long stepped into the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm. If they were to fight, even she would have some trouble. And Mu Chen was just a Fourth Grade Sovereign right now, so it was unfavourable for Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe. If you want to fight, my Skycroc Troop will accompany you till the end. Except that I’m afraid that not even half of your Nine Nether Troop will survive.” Xu Ba eerily laughed with killing intent in his tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then your Skycroc Troop will be buried along with us!” Nine Nether refuted coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi smiled as he stopped Xu Ba, who wanted to respond, and looked at Mu Chen. “You’re very smart. So you should be able to tell the current situation. The Nine Nether Troop is, indeed, on another level now that a Spirit of Battle Will has been formed. But your Nine Nether Troop is at the disadvantage in quantity, so the outcome would definitely be a heavy blow for both sides if the battle breaks out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, the best way to settling this matter would be to change from a battle between troops to individuals…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he looked at Fang Yi. “Your words are so dignified, indeed. But I have seen the killing intent in your eyes… I believe that you must have suddenly acquired the intent to kill me, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi narrowed his eyes. Mu Chen’s words were true to his heart. In the beginning, he did not place Mu Chen on the same level as him, but after seeing that Mu Chen was able to refine the Spirit of Battle Will, he had no choice but to change his view. He had started to sense the threat brought about by Mu Chen’s potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he allowed Mu Chen to grow, Mu Chen would definitely become a great enemy of their Divine Pavilion in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, such an opponent had to be killed before he grew up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t dare to accept my challenge, I understand.” Fang Yi faintly said, “After all, you’re a newcomer. It is already extremely rare for someone like you to come this far, which I have to say, makes me admire you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your psychological attacks aren’t too good.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi lightly knitted his brows, since he had finally experienced how difficult Mu Chen was to handle. Although he was young, his wisdom was extremely mature without the slightest arrogance that someone as young as him should possess. Mu Chen not taking up the bait made Fang Yi feel a little depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…” Just when Fang Yi frowned his brows, Mu Chen smiled with his eyes narrowed. “If you really want to challenge, there’s actually a very simple solution…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets.” Mu Chen spread out his five fingers and smiled with his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere in this region, which felt a little tense, suddenly froze in an instant. It was so much so that even someone like Fang Yi briefly had a dazed expression…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one expected Mu Chen to speak in such a blackmailing tone. Furthermore, the reason for his blackmail made others unable to know whether they should laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets?” Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Xu Ba smiled from the anger as he eerily looked at him and mocked, “Brat, do you think that your life is worth five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a joke, five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets was practically their harvest for the day. Furthermore, it was still a fact that they were rather fortunate and found several ruins, and painfully extracted them. Yet, right now, Mu Chen had demanded five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets, who did he think he was?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not up to you to decide whether I’m worth five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen still maintained an eye-narrowing smile as he looked at Fang Yi, whose face was a little stiffened, and stretched his hand out. “Brother Fang Yi, if you want to kill me, then I don’t think that it’s that high a price to pay. Of course… if you feel that this method isn’t good…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the smile on Mu Chen’s face retracted as a cold light and killing intent surged within his black pupils. “Then we can just have both our troops fight. I’ll see if your Skycroc Troop can make my Nine Nether Troop pay a huge price!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The killing intent that suddenly filled Mu Chen’s tone caused the temperature in this region to drop. His sudden facial changes made many experts startled, since they started to feel that this gentle and warm youth had a tiger concealing deep in his bones as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once his bottom line had been touched, his warmth would be replaced with sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Ba’s face changed, and just when he was about to flare up, he was stopped by Fang Yi from the side. The latter coldly looked at Mu Chen and slowly &nbsp;said, “Mu Chen, is there any meaning in this? There are some things that you cannot take away with you despite having it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Five hundred and not a single pellet less. If you are willing to pay, then we will fight. Otherwise, let us start the battle of our troops.” Mu Chen waved his hand with a slight smile. His attitude made Xu Ba’s face uncontrollably twitch. He wished he could tear him apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing beside Mu Chen, Nine Nether couldn’t help laughing as she gave Mu Chen a glare. Clearly, she didn’t know whether to cry or laugh from Mu Chen’s actions of demanding money to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi stared at Mu Chen as a chill swiftly surged in his eyes. But, in the end, he did not flare up and had calmly smiled instead. “Since that is what you wish, then we’ll go along with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mount Lord Xu, please.” Fang Yi turned his gaze to Xu Ba.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Ba’s face twitched and clearly felt an extreme heartache to part with them. After all, the five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets was practically their whole harvest. If all of it was given away, then their efforts would have been in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They won’t leave here.” Fang Yi said slowly.</span></p>

Five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets flew out and shot towards Mu Chen under countless greedy gazes.</span></p>

He had only briefly cast a glance, before storing them with a smile and his eyes narrowed. “Brother Fang is truly generous.”</span></p>

Fang Yi was clearly confident about killing Mu Chen from his action of tossing five hundred Fallen Origin Pellets out, and her making her move didn’t seem appropriate.</span></p>

It was just as Fang Yi had said, even if the Nine Nether Troop could emerge victorious in the battle, they would have to pay a price. Except that Mu Chen knew that it would be smaller than what Fang Yi had claimed but he was still unwilling.</span></p>

It had gone just as Mu Chen had predicted. Just before that, he didn’t mind letting Fang Yi pay a price beforehand to disgust them a little.</span></p>

Only actions could break up the current situation.</span></p>

Even if Mu Chen’s strength had improved, not even Nine Nether was certain if he could confront Fang Yi.</span></p>

The aura that was emitting from his body had also started to turn sharp, like a divine spear that had been unsheathed.</span></p>
