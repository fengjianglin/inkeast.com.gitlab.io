 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those words exited Nine Nether’s mouth, Mu Chen’s body suddenly trembled with shock in his eyes as he looked at the grey-robed figure. He never expected that the mysterious person before him would be someone from the extremely legendary and mysterious Ancient Haven Palace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After coming to the Skylaw Continent for so long, this was the first time that he came in contact with someone from the mysterious palace and from such a close distance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s someone from the Ancient Haven Palace? You’re not wrong, right?” Mu Chen’s throat trembled as he fixed his gaze on the grey-robed figure and spoke in disbelief. Clearly, he felt that it was a little hard to believe that he could get information on the item that he dreamed of after entering the Fallen Battlefield for such a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t be wrong. The spiritual rune between his brows is unique to the Ancient Haven Palace. That is due to cultivating a Divine Art from the Ancient Haven Palace, definitely not engraved on.” Nine Nether firmly said with confidence. She was, after all, someone of the Nine Nether Bird Clan, so she knew many secrets and had some understandings towards the Ancient Haven Palace as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen breathed out in relief as his gaze fixed onto the grey-robed figure. Right now, the crimson light and ferocity in the latter’s eyes had completely disappeared and his mummified face started to show a gentle expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those sparkles of light disappeared, they could vaguely see numerous figures. Their appearances weren’t clear, but they had all turned around and gave Mu Chen a bow, as if they were thanking him for finding a place for their bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After bowing, those figures turned into sparkles of light and disappeared, completely disappearing from this world.</span></p>

Although he had previously arranged their bones, it was due to the little pity and respect he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you’ve accidentally saved us.”</span></p>

Previously, they had sensed the evil aura, thus, awakening that last strand of their will and joined together to expel the evil aura.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen bitterly smiled, since he clearly never expected this to happen. A casual action of his had actually left a bit of karma behind. If it wasn’t for the will of these fallen experts, he and Nine Nether could only flee with heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is he now? Can he still be considered a living person?” Mu Chen looked at the grey-robed figure and couldn’t help asking. If that person was truly someone from the Ancient Haven Palace, then he could definitely obtain accurate information about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. I have died tens of thousands of years ago. The evil aura had infected my body and sealed my consciousness. Although it had maintained my body, it was just the surface of it. Now that the evil aura has been dispelled, my body should be turning into ash very soon.” A hoarse voice was suddenly heard, sounding like a heavy burden had been lifted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether were startled and they realised that the eyes of the grey-robed figure were, once again, flickering with vigour. But anyone could tell that it was only the final radiance before death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey-robed figure had restored his consciousness at this moment and looked at the two, then deeply bowed. “Many thanks to the two of you for freeing me from the pain of the evil aura.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether immediately bowed in response. “Senior is being too kind. Senior sacrificed yourself for the Great Thousand World. As the later generation, we can be considered to be indebted to you guys. So it’s natural for us to do this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey-robed figure gently smiled as he looked at the two of them. “My body won’t last for long. I am probably unable to repay the grace of you two, but if you two have any questions, ask away. I will answer with my very best ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could clearly tell that Mu Chen and Nine Nether seemed to be very interested to his identity as someone from the Ancient Haven Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen rejoiced as he cupped his fists. “Senior, are you someone from the Ancient Haven Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am the head disciple of the Ancient Haven Palace’s Fourth Hall Master, Xiao Qingyun.” The grey-robed figure gently smiled. When he spoke of the Ancient Haven Palace, his face was filled with pride and was clearly extremely proud of his identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fourth Hall Master?” Mu Chen and Nine Nether exchanged a look, since they were clearly rather unfamiliar about these matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, the Ancient Haven Palace had seven halls with a master in each of the halls with the Palace Master above them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the puzzlement on the two’s faces, Xiao Qingyun gently frowned his brows with a smear of anxiety flashing in his eyes, then spoke gently after some hesitation. “I wonder, in the current Great Thousand World, my Ancient Haven Palace…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen bitterly smiled. “Senior, there is no longer an Ancient Haven Palace in the Great Thousand World.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qingyun’s expression froze and he kept silent for a long while. He looked as if his vitality had disappeared as he muttered, “So even my Ancient Haven Palace could not escape from that tribulation…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, it’s said that the current Ancient Haven Palace is hidden in a spatial realm in the Skylaw Continent. Ordinary people cannot find it, but there is something I need in the Ancient Haven Palace. So I wish to enter it. I wonder, can Senior can help me with regards to this?” Mu Chen carefully asked as he looked at Xiao Qingyun with his eyes filled with expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qingyun froze, before revealing a bitter smile. “I’m sorry about this. It must definitely be the Palace Master’s work to be able to conceal the entire Ancient Haven Palace. His ability exceeds the sky, and if he wished to conceal it, not even I would know how to find the Ancient Haven Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen’s heart suddenly turned cold. He initially thought that Xiao Qingyun could feed him some information. But, who could have expected that Xiao Qingyun’s knowledge would be even less than his own?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen’s expression, Xiao Qingyun was a little awkward as he coughed, “But you don’t have to be anxious about it. Although I am not aware about where the Ancient Haven Palace is, I believe my teacher, the Fourth Hall Master, knows.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Fourth Hall Master?” Mu Chen felt a surge of headaches. Such an ancient figure would probably have died by now. Wanting to find him, Mu Chen would rather just search the entire Skylaw Continent bit by bit for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Hall Master has also fallen in this battlefield. With his ability, he should be able to maintain a strand of his will, despite dying. If you guys can find him, I believe you guys will be able to obtain news of the Ancient Haven Palace.” Xiao Qingyun sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he exchanged a look with Nine Nether. This Fourth Hall Master of the Ancient Haven Palace was probably an Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouse. That meant that his will must’ve been left in one of the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasuries. But even Mandala wasn’t confident in finding the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasuries that had been concealed by the array in this place. So, how could they accomplish it with their strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qingyun gave the two of them a smile as he fiddled with his bosom and retrieved a black compass with mysterious light runes faintly visible on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although I have been a zombie for many years, I am still aware of the changes in this battlefield. This Spiritual Compass is an object of my Ancient haven Palace, it can search for the mysterious energy in this battlefield. Because this item was initially a belonging of the Hall Master, his imprint is left in it. When you guys approach the place where the Hall Master has fallen, this compass will guide you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyes lit up as he received the black compass and his heartbeat uncontrollably accelerated. That’s because he knew what the mysterious energy meant in Xiao Qingyun’s words was. It was the Fallen Origin Aura that they needed the most!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That meant that with this compass, they would be able to locate the ruins. With their task of collecting Fallen Origin Aura to refine the Fallen Origin Pellets, it was of great help.</span></p>
