The peak was like a sword as it pierced the clouds, the scene was immensely grand.</span></p>

Not only was it managed by the three Emperors, rumour had it that the mysterious Ruler also resided on this peak.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today was the Nine Kings Conference that was held every 6 months. Speaking of which, it was also the more important conference in the Great Havenlaw Domain, so there wouldn’t usually be any missing seats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Greatlaw Peak stood a towering palace that was emitting an ancient aura, as if it was left behind from the ancient times. It caused revere to rise in the heart of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the palace was a myriad stone staircase. Every single ray of light landed beneath those stairs, they did not directly fly up to the highest point; instead, they chose to ascend the stairs respectfully.</span></p>

However, the majority of those had their own batch standing together, differentiating their standings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as it was a place with people, there would definitely be competition. These rules hadn’t been changed, and factions were competing amongst themselves in the Greatlaw Sky. Thus, the grudges between the factions were also extremely complicated.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone shifted their gazes over, and when they saw who it was that came, there was a dense shock in their eyes that spewed out, which was shortly followed by resounding whispers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the… Nine Nether King? She has returned?”</span></p>

Nine Nether King has disappeared for so many years, rumour has it that she was undergoing her Tribulation. From the looks of it now, she should have succeeded in it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How formidable, to have successfully undergone her Tribulation at her age, shredding spirituality and forming divinity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like there will be a show to watch in the Nine Kings Conference. For all these years, the Nine Nether Palace has been suppressed, headed by the Blood Hawk King. With Nine Nether King’s personality, she would definitely not let it go so easily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the past, when Nine Nether King had yet to go through her Tribulation, she had the Sky Vulture Emperor supporting her, but she wasn't a threat. But, now that she has undergone her Tribulation, I’m afraid that the matter won’t be so easily left to rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the vast platform, whispers of all sorts rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As to those whispers, Nine Nether paid no attention to them as she raised her head, looking at the ancient palace up on the myriad stone staircase. She slightly narrowed her slender eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, Tang Bing and Tang Rou stood behind Nine Nether and did not glance sideways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after Nine Nether had shown herself, there were whistlings of wind that resounded once again from the horizon. Several figures flew over and had landed on the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with those figures appearing, there was a powerful Spiritual Energy pressure that enveloped the surroundings. Those figures were naturally those influential figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swept his gaze over and realised that three batches had arrived. The one leading the left batch was a middle-aged man with no expression on his face. He was donned in a black robe, his eyes were dark red in colour, giving others a chill down their spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing behind that middle-aged man was a slightly younger man. His figure was towering, donned in the azure garment and his brows were as piercing as a sword. He had a rather handsome appearance, along with extraordinary Spiritual Energy ripples fluctuating around him. His bearing was rather calm, except that when he saw a slender silhouette, ripples couldn’t help swinging in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Asura King, the strongest among the Nine Kings. With time, he might even ascend to the level of the three Emperors.” When Mu Chen saw the two figures, Tang Bing explained from the side in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head with a grave look in his eyes. The feeling that the Asura King gave him was even more powerful and unfathomable than the black-robed old man with Liu Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for the person standing behind the Asura King, he is Xu Qing, the head of the Four Great Domain Lords. His strength is rather impressive as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze moved, shifted onto the man donned in the azure garments. The latter’s gaze was focused onto Nine Nether; looking at it, it seemed that what Tang Rou said before might be the truth. This Xu Qing did have some thoughts on Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there wasn’t any response from Nine Nether regarding his pleasantly surprised gaze. Except that when she saw the Asure King when she directed her gaze over, she gave him a slight nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this Asura King was tough to approach in the Great Havenlaw Domain, in Nine Nether’s view, this Asura King was clearly more scheming than the Blood Hawk King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Asura King saw Nine Nether, there was a faint ripple on his face that didn’t have any expression. In the end, he gave her a nod in reply. In the past, Nine Nether was just a brat in his eyes. But her return this time made him feel a little pressure.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like she has risen her strength after all these years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man standing behind Asura King bitterly smiled when he saw that Nine Nether had not cast him a glance. But the splendour in his eyes grew even more brilliant, as if he had suddenly found his motivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shifted his gaze and looked at the second batch. The one leading was a middle-aged man with a robust build. His hands were rather large in size, with veins protruding from them like worms, as if that pair of hands could split the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Mountain Splitting King… he’s also a formidable figure amongst the Nine Kings.” Tang Bing briefly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head as his gaze suddenly changed, he saw another robust man that had occasionally drifted his gaze over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The target of his gaze clearly wasn’t Mu Chen, but the Tang Bing who, with a cold expression, was standing beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, that’s the number two of the Four Great Domain Lords, Zhou Yue. He seems to be rather fond of big sister. In the past, he had sneaked into our Nine Nether Palace to peek at big sister. Later on, when it was discovered by a big sister, he was simply chased out with a sword.” Tang Rou secretly laughed as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like your big sister’s charm isn’t small.” Mu Chen was somewhat intrigued. This Zhou Yue clearly had some feelings for Tang Bing, but looking at Tang Bing, she didn’t seem to care about him that much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing frowned her brows as she cast a glance at Mu Chen. The latter was smiling at her, which led her to turn her head with indignance. She realised that Mu Chen’s skin was rather thick, even when she glared at him, he didn’t feel that he did something wrong.</span></p>

There wasn’t much disappointment in her eyes, although she felt a little hurt when she heard the news yesterday. When she met him again, the feeling felt like he was a stranger. She only somewhat felt pity that the youth that she had rescued from the battlefield back then had gradually turned bad.</span></p>
