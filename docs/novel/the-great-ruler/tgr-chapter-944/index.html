 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

But the intensity of it made the eyelids of Mu Chen, who was watching from the side, to twitch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because all the peak experts had made their moves towards the three remaining lumps of light. The confrontation had even shattered the space in this region. If it wasn’t for this rock island being out of the ordinary, it would have collapsed long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The result of the intense competition had ended in the hands of the Divine Pavilion, Netherworld Palace and the Myriad Saint Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, it wasn’t because the strength of the other peak forces was lacking, it’s just that luck was heavily relied upon in such a chaotic battle and they were slightly more fortunate than others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three lumps of light were obtained, the experts of the Divine Pavilion, Netherworld Palace and the Myriad Saint Peak had immediately brought them out. Indeed, as they have expected, there were three dazzling crystal bottles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bottles were carved with ancient runes and such a Divine Artifact was clearly what they needed the most at this moment…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment they obtained the jade bottles, the three forces had immediately utilised them under the reddened eyes of others. The jade bottles trembled and lights blossomed from them as they started to emit a suction force. The lake water was being endlessly sucked into the jade bottles with the golden light vaguely flickering at the mouth of the bottles and the powerful Spiritual Energy undulations were gradually being formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene was a pleasant surprise for the three other forces. The jade bottles were indeed extraordinary, they were more powerful than the other refining artifacts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Pavilion Lords of the Divine Pavilion inwardly felt relieved. But as they looked at Mu Chen, their gazes were filled with unwillingness. That’s because the latter had a dolium as big as a basin, thus the refining speed had also exceeded theirs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That accursed brat!” The Four Pavilion Lords clenched their teeth, furious by the fact that Mu Chen had obtained the biggest benefit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, they had no intention to make a move, since the stone troops around Mu Chen were extraordinary. Furthermore, he was also protected by the three Emperors, it was futile, even if they had gone all-out. So they would rather use their jade bottle to take as much lake water as possible to see if they could refine more Spiritual Divine Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

Every force had occupied a location and had utilised each of their own refining artifacts to absorb as much lake water as they could. Thus, the battles in the rock island had stopped, the only sound present was the slashing sound of water…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy shock waves originated from the battle between the seven Earth Sovereigns and the Spiritual Puppet of the Fourth Palace Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala looked at the incoming attack and her expression had turned solemn. The puppet, which had only defended at the start of the fight, had actually started to launch attacks. The attacks from it were extremely terrifying. They were so much so that even someone of her strength had felt a little fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden light surged in Mandala’s eyes as she threw a palm forth. The palm appeared weak without any force, but as the palm slammed down, it had shattered the space in its path before clashing with the crystallised rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the shock wave blew out, Mandala had taken a step back and the streak of crystallised rock had broken apart, before turning into sparkles of light, then faded away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala blocked that attack, the six other Earth Sovereigns had used all means to destroy the incoming attacks as well. Every single one of them had a grave expression, since they had sensed that the Spiritual Puppet had grown stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing in the centre of the seven people, the Spiritual Puppet of the Fourth Palace Master’s eyes flickered with light, before it lowered its head to take a glance at the rock island, then unleashed a roar. A terrifying Spiritual Energy exploded from its body, before forming into numerous extremely dazzling crystallised halos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seven Earth Sovereigns couldn’t help having a slight change in their expressions as they sensed the Spiritual Puppet’s soaring Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like they have found the Spiritual Divine Liquid!” The Divine Pavilion Master’s gaze flickered as the changes of the Spiritual Puppet were definitely due to the rock island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes of the other Earth Sovereigns shook as well, with a hint of joy in their eyes. Thereafter, the joy had turned into doubt, since they had no idea which force had obtained the Spiritual Divine Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they were submerged in their thoughts, the silhouette of the Spiritual Puppet descended towards the rock island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s going to protect the Spiritual Divine Liquid! Quick, stop it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala immediately yelled upon seeing that, before she slammed her palm downward. The Spiritual Energy palm whistled out as the wind and rain gathered. The cold rain pierced through space, while the gale could tear the heavens and earth apart. The might of that palm was extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That palm from Mandala had immediately sent the Spiritual Puppet retreating. At the same time, the remaining Earth Sovereigns had also joined together to unleash their attacks. The violent attacks had quickly trapped the Spiritual Puppet so that it couldn’t enter the rock island to protect the Spiritual Divine Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being tightly bound by the seven Earth Sovereigns, the Spiritual Puppet had unleashed a roar and a terrifying Spiritual Energy swept over, forcing the Earth Sovereigns to have no choice but to be cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A mere Spiritual Puppet also wants to obstruct us?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, all of a sudden, a cold bark rang out, before Mandala and the rest were startled to see the Divine Pavilion Master shot down and immediately appeared before the Spiritual Puppet, before throwing a palm forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden change of events caused the other Earth Sovereigns to be startled and all of them had an unsightly expression. When they fought with the Spiritual Puppet, they were clear of the latter’s strength. If they were to fight one-on-one, it would be impossible for any of them to restrain it. Therefore, none of them dared to casually approach the Spiritual Puppet and had opted to join forces together…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, they had no idea why the Divine Pavilion Master would suddenly go risking his life…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they had weird expressions on their faces, the Divine Pavilion Master had already thrown a palm down. Five dazzling lights burst forth from his palm, which shone onto the heavens and earth. The might of it was extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Puppet had also unleashed a roar with light blossoming in its eyes, before throwing a palm forth. In that instant, when the palm was thrown out, crystallised halos had also gathered over in response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala and the rest saw this scene, they couldn’t help squinting their eyes. All of them could actually join forces at this moment to put the Spiritual Puppet under control. But… due to the ulterior motives in their hearts, none of them had made a move.</span></p>

If they could make use of the Spiritual Puppet to weaken him, it was good news for everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Space had collapsed within the range of a few dozen feet. It was so much so that even the ocean down below had been split in half with a deep bottomless ravine being revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shock waves wreaked havoc and the Spiritual Puppet of the Fourth Palace Master was immediately sent flying back as a crack appeared on its arm, as if it was about to shatter. Clearly, it had suffered heavy injuries.</span></p>

A trace of blood had appeared at the corner of his lips and his silhouette had shot out like a cannonball into the ocean down below with a splash and no one knew how deep had he been sent into the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other Earth Sovereigns in the sky saw this scene, the corner of their lips uncontrollably twitched since they had no idea why the usually calm and cunning Divine Pavilion Master would be so impulsive. Although he had managed to wound the Spiritual Puppet, he must’ve been heavily injured as well. There weren’t any benefits in such a confrontation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Looks like the Divine Pavilion Master has lost his mind over the Spiritual Divine Liquid.” The Sky Serpent Old Ghost let out a burst of strange laughter as he rejoiced in the misfortune of others.</span></p>

We will continue to restrain the Spiritual Puppet, buying enough time for those on the rock island.” Mandala faintly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Earth Sovereigns had also slightly nodded their heads, since they couldn’t be bothered about the injuries of the Divine Pavilion Master at this moment. Furthermore, they were all competitors, so they were more than willing to see the Divine Pavilion Master being heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the six of them had, once again, joined forces together to restrain the Spiritual Puppet of the Fourth Palace Master. After witnessing the might of it sending the Divine Pavilion Master flying, they were more cautious and did not dare to approach the Spiritual Puppet like the Divine Pavilion Master did to clash with it head-on…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were also not bothered with the Divine Pavilion Master that had not appeared for a long time. That fellow must have suffered heavy injuries and had resorted to hiding deep in the ocean to recover, in case he wouldn’t be able to compete for Spiritual Divine Liquid when it appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

Facing the attacks of the six Earth Sovereigns, it could only maintain a defence, but judging from its state of gradually becoming more violent, Mandala and the rest knew that the Spiritual Divine Liquid must have been obtained…</span></p>
