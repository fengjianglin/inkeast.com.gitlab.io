 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen spent two days to help the three Kings’ troops to form their Pseudo-Battle Will Spirit, and the price of doing so was him being in a weakened state for a full day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Refining the Battle Will Spirit did not exhaust Spiritual Energy, but one’s will. The requirement to control myriads of will was high and this was also the reason why there were so many powerful experts but not every one of them could command Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Connecting to the Battle Will of the four troops and leaving an imprint in the minds of every single warrior was definitely not easy. So when Mu Chen completed this, he was in a weakened state for a full day, before he gradually recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Mu Chen had recovered the next day, the first thing the four Kings gave was their gratitude as they showed unprecedented courteousness. That’s because when Mu Chen was in his weakened state yesterday, they had all tested the might of the Pseudo-Battle Will Spirits. Although they couldn’t be compared to genuine Battle Will Spirits, they still allowed the strength of their troops to rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, after they had personally tasted the sweetness, they naturally knew the importance of Mu Chen. They naturally had to get close to such a person. Otherwise, their troops would be reverted back the moment the imprints were used up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nine Nether saw their attitudes beside Mu Chen, she couldn’t help feeling amused and lamentable. Back then, when she became a King in the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Mountain Splitting King and the rest had not targeted her like the Blood Hawk King, but they all felt disdain in their hearts. After all, regardless of her age or strength, she was still insufficient to be granted a King title.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that Nine Nether wasn’t comparable to the past and her strength comparable to the other Kings, she was clear that it could, at most, let the Mountain Splitting King and the rest not to have contempt for her. But it was still impossible for the latter to be courteous to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, even someone as prideful as the Mountain Splitting King was being courteous to their Nine Nether Troop and did not dare to offend them. All these changes originated from Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps that youth did not possess astonishing strength, but he had relied on his own means and made experts like the Mountain Splitting King to take the initiative to make friends with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys don’t have to be so courteous. We’re all from the Great Havenlaw Domain, so we naturally have to help each other in this Hunting War.” In response to the four Kings being courteous, Mu Chen had also politely replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the four Kings saw how polite Mu Chen was and not acting arrogant because he had grasped such an important thing like the imprint, they felt more at ease in their hearts and their expression turned even more gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. King Mu, we have been slowing down our speed for the past few days, so shall we go all-out now?” The Mountain Splitting King laughed as his words clearly implied that it was Mu Chen’s decision to make.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen briefly pondered, before saying, “How’s the current situation in the Fallen Battlefield?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he had focused all of his energy to refine Battle Will Spirits for the past few days, he did not pay much attention to the situation in the Fallen Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s getting increasingly intense.” The Mountain Splitting King’s face turned solemn as he continued, “We are all making our way towards the depths of the Fallen Battlefield. So, generally speaking, the further we go, we will encounter the more powerful forces. If a battle breaks out, it will definitely be a huge one. According to our information, over a hundred forces have been destroyed in the past few days… Not lacking top forces in the list as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen squinted his eyes. The top forces could already be considered as a considerable force in the Northern Region, but they were still annihilated. So he couldn’t imagine how brutal the battle was right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Any news regarding the Great Havenlaw Domain?” Mu Chen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Fallen Battlefield is too vast, so there’s a limit to the information that we can gather. So we are unsure of the others’ situations.” The Spiritual Sword King replied as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded. “I’m afraid that the Fallen Origin Pellets are still insufficient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they had borrowed the power of the Spiritual Compass and obtained over ten thousand Fallen Origin Pellets, it was said that any single Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury would require tens of thousands or even more Fallen Origin Pellets just for a single layer of the seal. Therefore, the amount of Fallen Origin Pellets was still far from sufficient in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right now, the Fallen Origin Pellets that can be refined from Grade-3 Ruins is too little. So we need higher graded ruins.” Nine Nether spoke with her brows furrowed. Generally speaking, a Grade-3 Ruin could refine a few hundred Fallen Origin Pellets. If it was the start of the Hunting War, it was definitely a considerable amount. But right now, this amount was a little insufficient. In addition, they had a few troops combined together, so they wouldn’t get much after splitting it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although, with the Spiritual Compass, it could be filled up with the amount of Grade-3 Ruins that they could discover, the worth of Grade-3 Ruins was still too low and the treasures left in them couldn’t tempt the heart of the few Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Higher graded ruins…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen fell into thoughts. Above the Grade-3 Ruins would be Grade-2 Ruins. The Grade-2 Ruins were truly extraordinary, since they had fortunately encountered one in the past. Despite paying some price for it, even with them joining hands together, the harvest was delightful. Just a single ruin could be comparable to ten Grade-3 Ruins. Not to mention any treasures, just the Fallen Origin Pellets that could be refined along had reached thousands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But despite the ample harvest that’s contained in a Grade-2 Ruin, it was too hard to find. Some time ago, they had only managed to find one with the help of the Spiritual Compass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the current Fallen Battlefield, as long as there was news of any Grade-2 Ruins, it would probably cause countless forces to surge over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it is about higher graded ruins… I wonder if you guys have heard of the news that’s been spreading around over these past two days?” The Great Cliff King, who had remained silent, suddenly spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” The Mountain Splitting King and the rest were stunned, their brows knitted together. “Are you perhaps talking about the Death Ruin that has been making waves for the past two days?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Death Ruin?” Mu Chen asked in doubt, since he had no idea about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Recently, in the northwestern region of the Fallen Battlefield, a ruin had been discovered. It’s said that till now, no one has managed to make it out alive, so it was named the Death Ruin.” Nine Nether explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now, the news of the Death Ruin has been spreading out, which aroused the interest of many powerful forces. That’s because, according to their speculations, the Death Ruin might be a Grade-1 Ruin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grade-1 Ruin?!” Mu Chen’s pupils suddenly, uncontrollably narrowed. They were ruins a level beneath Earth Sovereign Realm Treasuries. In the past, he had tried to rely on the Spiritual Compass, but not a single Grade-1 Ruin had been found. So one could see how hidden those ruins were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the news. But we’re unsure if it is a Grade-1 Ruin. After all, in this damnable Fallen Battlefield, anything can happen. No one knows what can be obtained inside. But…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King paused voice, before looking at Mu Chen. “It’s said that this Death Ruin seems to have traces left behind by Battle Formation Masters…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle Formation Masters?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s countenance drastically changed as a fire burned in his eyes. Battle Formation Master? That was a legendary existence that was exceedingly rare in the Great Thousand World. He didn’t know if it could allow him to become a genuine Battle Formation Master. Even if he could control Battle Will, he had only stepped on the surface level and still had to rely on himself to probe around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether seemed to have expected Mu Chen’s response and said, “It’s said that someone found bones of a massive army. Therefore, they speculated that the Death Ruin must’ve been left behind by a Battle Formation Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gradually calmed his heart, before nodding his head a long while later. The Death Ruin might be extremely tempting, but the dangers that were held within it were unimaginable. Therefore, even a decisive person like him couldn’t help hesitating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was just their Nine Nether Palace alone, Mu Chen would naturally give it a try. After all, the temptation of a Battle Formation Master was pretty significant to him. However, the other Kings were present here as well. Therefore, Mu Chen was not sure if they were willing to make such a huge risk for a mere rumour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they had not seen the Death Ruin personally, it’s definitely not a benevolent place for it to possess such an ominous name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you’re interested in the Death Ruin, then make your decision fast. According to rumours, the Battle Will geniuses of the Sky Profound Palace and Divine Pavilion are rushing towards the Death Ruin. If I have not guessed incorrectly, they should be heading there because of the news about the Battle Formation Master.” Nine Nether lightly smiled as her voice provoked the temptation in Mu Chen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. If King Mu is interested, we will naturally follow you. With the Battle Will Spirits of our four troops, we should have the strength to protect ourselves, no matter how dangerous the Death Ruin is.” Seemingly to know about the hesitation in Mu Chen’s heart, the four Kings exchanged a look as they smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, we have not seen how formidable a Grade-1 Ruin is, so we naturally have to go take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing their words, Mu Chen finally felt heavily relieved. If it was their Nine Nether Palace alone, it would be extremely dangerous. But with the support of the four Kings, their safety could be greatly increased. This was probably because he helped them refine the Battle Will Spirits for their troops, giving them a favour. Otherwise, the four Kings would probably be unwilling to be involved with the unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, regardless, since the four Kings had all agreed to it, then they could place the Death Ruin as their objective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly balled his hands as a flame surged in the depths of his black pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle Formation Master… He’s looking forward to it now and hoped that the Death Ruin wouldn’t disappoint him.</span></p>
