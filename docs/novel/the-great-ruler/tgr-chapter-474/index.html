Just like the Xu Huang trio before them, all of them stared at the Divine Spiritual Tree with reddish eyes. As their breathing became heavier, unconcealable greed erupted from their eyes. The enticement of this Divine Spiritual Tree truly was too much for them to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Witnessing the scene before them, Mu Chen’s group did not take action at all. Instead, with an unsympathetic gaze, they simply watched the fellows whose rationality had been consumed by greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their speed was exceptionally quick. In the span of merely ten breaths, they had already neared the Divine Spiritual Tree. However, there was something unusual happening. They did not face any resistance at all, and with a strong gust of wind, they had barbarically tore the Divine Spiritual Fruit right off the tree one after another into their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, a Divine Spiritual Fruit! &nbsp;With this, I can survive the Human Body Disaster!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grasping onto the Divine Spiritual Fruit that radiated with boundless Spiritual Energy, they could not help heartily laughing in that moment. Eyes filled with ecstasy, they immediately stuffed the Divine Spiritual Fruit right into their mouths in a single bite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boundless Spiritual Energy rippled out from within their bodies. However, immediately after, shocked and inconsolable expressions appeared on their faces as they suddenly felt an indescribable heat gushing out from inside their bodies. As this happened, their skin turned crimson red, while black-coloured blood started oozing from all their pores. Unexpectedly, black flames were mixed within the trails of black blood flowing out from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!”</span></p>

With a loud bang, he exploded into a bloody mist. The mist floated on the wind, eventually floating back to the Divine Spiritual Tree and condensing, forming another Divine Spiritual Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strange scene caused those who had retained their senses and not acted rashly to feel ice-cold all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!</span></p>

Black flames erupted from their bodies, before they immediately turned into clumps of bloody mist. All the blood mists were eventually absorbed by the Divine Spiritual Tree, forming one Divine Spiritual Fruit after another, hanging plumply on the tree, swaying in the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short span of only a few minutes, many of those unfortunate souls who had eaten the Divine Spiritual Fruits had exploded into bloody mists, and were turned into new Divine Spiritual Fruits in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gulp.</span></p>

Fortunately, they had been obstructed by Mu Chen, if not, their current state would be exactly the same as those people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen also deeply exhaled. Staring solemnly at the Divine Spiritual Tree, he slowly said, “This thing’s definitely not a Divine Spiritual Tree!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the surrounding region, all of the teams had quietened down with some of them having pale expressions on their faces. Even someone like Xia Hou was watching on with tightly knitted brows. These teams had exhausted all their methods in order to charge past the Dark Origin Forest&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">full of demonic trees and arrive here. Was it all for naught? What about the supposed ancient inheritance? Could it be that it was referring to this extremely strange demonic tree in front of them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh? The Divine Spiritual Tree seems to be changing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this moment of silence, there was a sudden exclamation of shock. As the many gazes hurriedly shot over, everyone saw that within the light pillar, the Divine Spiritual Tree was actually changing gradually from its original emerald-green luster into a slightly black colour. In just half a minute, the Divine Spiritual Tree, originally abundant with a divine aura, had become covered in a demonic aura. The Divine Spiritual Fruits on the tree had also changed in appearance. They actually had sinister human faces on them, with black blood flowed continuously from the fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Mei’er stared at the demonic tree that had just drastically changed, taking in a sharp breath. “It seems like this is actually a Demonic Spiritual Tree. It’s absolutely not a Divine Spiritual Tree!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s group wore grave expressions as they nodded in agreement. Even though the Demonic Spiritual Tree only differed from the Divine Spiritual Tree by just a single word, they were two entirely different objects. It was said that these strange trees had the ability to confuse people’s conscious thoughts, and could emit a scent akin to an otherworldly treasure from far away, attracting greedy treasure seekers, while changing its appearance into such treasures. However, once people consumed its fruits, they would be immolated by demonic flames and turned into a bloody mist, before being absorbed by the Demonic Spiritual Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was then that Mu Chen realised why he had felt that something was off earlier on. As it turned out, the tree in front of them was not a Divine Spiritual Tree, but rather, a strange and dreadful Demonic Spiritual Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We were enticed here by this damned thing?” Tang Mei’er clenched her teeth in reluctance. “Could it be that the supposed ancient inheritance is also a scam?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen wrinkled his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen!” Suddenly, Lin Zhou whispered, before pulled out an emerald-green jade plaque. There were many tree patterns engraved on the jade plaque, and at this very moment, it was glowing with a lustrous green light. Passing the jade plaque to Mu Chen, he said, “Something seems to be happening to this thing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being instantly startled, Mu Chen immediately received the jade plaque. This plaque should be the piece that Lin Zhou’s team had obtained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he grasped the medal, he could feel the warmth spreading from the medal. Looking over towards the Demonic Spiritual tree, he could see that at this moment, seemingly as a result of absorbing all the bloody mists, ray after ray of black lights were appearing on the Demonic Spiritual Tree. With every ray of black light that appeared, the jade plaque grew warmer and warmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze sparkled. With a flick of his finger, the jade medal transformed into a ray of green light and shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it shot out, the jade plaque had actually charged straight into the Demonic Spiritual Tree. Immediately, mournful screeches seemed to sound out from the tree. In the next instant, rays of light exploded from within the tree and its trunk rapidly split open. Boundless Spiritual Energy undulated in the surrounding space, before distortions started to appear. In the next instant, an enormous wooden palace appeared from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wooden palace hovered in mid-air, while the space surrounding it seemed to have formed its own realm, emanating an ancient air of vicissitudes from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This change in the situation caused everyone present to feel shocked, including Mu Chen, who had actually triggered this incident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless gazes were tightly locked onto that ancient wooden palace. However, this time round, no one dared to act rashly again. Those unlucky fellows who had gone ahead of them had already taught them a rather bloody lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under those countless attentive gazes, the ancient wooden palace suddenly gave out a buzzing sound. The thick, heavy, wooden doors that were tightly closed started to slowly open, bit by bit. An ancient smell swept out, rippling out into this space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like only after absorbing enough fresh blood will the Demonic Spiritual Tree trigger a response from the jade plaque.” Mu Chen softly commented. It seemed that those ancient experts who had left their inheritance were not kind people, actually requiring such a bloody method to open the wooden palace. Although most of them had lost their lives due to their avarice, normal people would not have thought of such a ruthless and brutal method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This should be the ancient inheritance hidden in this location.” Mu Chen glanced at Tang Mei’er’s team, laughing. “How about it? Interested?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Tang Mei’er simply smiled charmingly and replied, “After facing so much difficulty in charging into this place, if we return empty-handed, it would not fit our style of doing things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great, let’s make a move then.”</span></p>

Shooting a glance at Xia Hou’s team, &nbsp;his figure flashed and he shot out directly at that ancient wooden palace. Behind him, Luo Li, Tang Mei’er and the others tightly followed.</span></p>
