 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen stood with his hands behind his back. at his rear, a massive Spiritual Energy burst out before space distorted and silhouettes stepped out from the distortion, standing behind Mu Chen under all the bulging eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A total of five silhouettes, all of them emanating powerful Spiritual Energy with a terrifying pressure that spread out, tearing the clouds in the sky apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five of them were all Lesser Earth Sovereigns!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they appeared, the pressure from Xue Tong and the six other Lesser Earth Sovereigns had been immediately suppressed. On the contrary, they started to sense a terrifying pressure enveloping them from the sky that they were facing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, their faces instantly turned unsightly with an unconcealable fear gradually rising in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Five…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">five Lesser Earth Sovereigns?!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Are they actually from the so-called ‘Mu Abode’? The strength of the Mu Abode is actually so powerful?” Finally, some people recovered from the shock. They looked at this scene in disbelief. Even in the entire Lesser West Heaven Realm, probably only the Blood God Clan would bring out such an amount. But the Mu Abode that none of them had heard before also possessed such strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, they could tell that all five of those Lesser Earth Sovereigns were standing behind Mu Chen with respectful gazes. That also meant that they’re subordinates of Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, they finally understood why Mu Chen was so fearless when facing the Blood God Clan. It’s because he had the strength and qualifications to fight with the Blood God Clan; after all, even Xue Lingzi could only cower when facing such a formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he wanted to fight with his cultivation at the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm, then it would only result in two sides suffering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That fellow…” Luo Tianshen was also shocked by this scene. A brief moment later, he could only bitterly smile and shake his head. Mu Chen’s performance had won him over, but he never expected that Mu Chen would have such a hand hidden in his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did he become a powerhouse himself, he even had a gathering of such powerful existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to Luo Tianshen’s estimations, with Mu Chen’s current strength, he was not inferior to their Luo God Clan…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Contrasting this, Luo Tianshen’s gaze burned even further as he looked at Mu Chen.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This brat is truly a miracle, and perhaps, if he and Luo Li get together, it might bring a miracle for our Luo God Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We pay our respects to the Abode Ruler!” Under all the attention, Liu Tiandao and the other four weren’t bothered as they cupped their hands and performed a subordinate etiquette towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Look at their attitude, Mu Chen’s brows were raised. In the past, although they addressed him as Abode Ruler, he could tell the awkwardness it gave them. But this time, Mu Chen could hear that they spoke from the depths of their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at the five of them with a profound gaze and understood what was going on. It seemed like his achievements had not only intimidated the Blood God Clan, it even intimidated those fellows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an unexpected surprise, and Mu Chen lightly smiled. After all, it’s not easy for him to get those fellows that once ruled the Northern Region to acknowledge him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Abode Ruler has exhausted yourself from the three. Leave those fellows to us.” Netherworld Palace Master smiled. He was a decisive person, and since he had acknowledged Mu Chen, he would naturally position himself well and commit to his duties as a subordinate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Tiandao and the rest nodded their heads as they coldly looked at Xue Tong and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing the five of them, Xue Tong and the other five felt their scalps numbing. Although they had the advantage of numbers, Mu Chen had gravely injured nearly half. If they were to fight, they would definitely suffer a huge loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Earth Sovereigns of the Luo God Clan’s royal family branch felt bitter in their hearts. They never expected that not only would this young fellow have a powerful cultivation, the so-called “Mu Abode” was also even more terrifying with a total of five Lesser Earth Sovereigns!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That powerful formation wasn’t any weaker than the Blood God Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of that fellow’s appearance, the Luo God Clan’s situation had completely changed. Under his protection, Luo Li would be able to successfully obtain the inheritance, and her position in the Luo God Clan in the future would be unshakable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their failure was predetermined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They looked at Xue Lingzi in panic. At this moment, the latter had a serious expression. The appearance of the five Earth Sovereigns had greatly shocked him. But he was still a Greater Earth Sovereign, after all, so he managed to suppress his emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at Mu Chen with a dark gaze and slowly said, “I, Xue Lingzi, have met many people, and I never thought that I had underestimated you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His tone no longer contained the disdain from before and he started to view Mu Chen as someone on the same level. After all, Mu Chen’s status as the Mu Abode’s Abode Ruler was something that could make him feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen remained silent at his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingzi briefly pondered before saying, “I can give up pursuing the matters of killing an Elder of my Blood God Clan. I can even give you 300,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. All I ask is for you to leave, you can take Luo Li along with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words had instantly caused a vast commotion, since no one expected Xue Lingzi to be so decisive. Not only was he not going to pursue Mu Chen, he was even willing to make compensation and let Luo Li go. But if that happened, the Luo God Clan would definitely be doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That amount was not small, and even the Blood God Clan would have to empty their treasury for that. The citizens of the Luo God Clan looked at Mu Chen, trembling. That amount was unimaginable. Even a Greater Earth Sovereign would be shaken by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention that they knew that if Mu Chen refused, then he would be facing a Greater Earth Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, what a tempting offer.” Mu Chen was also astonished by Xue Lingzi’s boldness. He then gently laughed and looked at Luo Tianshen. “Patriarch Luo, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Tianshen was calm after hearing his question without any worries. It wasn’t because he believed in Mu Chen, Luo Li was the one that he believed in. With her eyesight, she naturally wouldn’t choose someone that would be attracted by money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Luo Tianshen, Mu Chen also flung his lips aside and smiled towards Xue Lingzi. “Bring out what other means you have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also his reply. When Xue Lingzi heard his words, he did not have many changes on his face. Only his body started trembling, his gaze grew colder. A brief moment later, he calmly said, “Since you guys don’t want to leave when the path is given to you, then don’t blame me for this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suddenly turned around and hollered with a respectful voice, “Senior Winter, please show yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with Xue Lingzi’s voice, the distant sky suddenly turned cold with snowflakes drifting down, freezing the land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As snowflakes drifted, they suddenly gathered before Xue Lingzi, turning into a white-robed elder. His brows and beard were white and looked skinny. Even without any expression, the snowflake runes could be vaguely seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, everyone focused their gazes over, and some people had drastically changed their expressions with their voices resounding, “That is Senior Winter Snow?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavens, why is he here?!” Everyone had astonishment on their faces. The faces of the Luo God Clan instantly turned ashen, and even Luo Tianshen had sweat dripping from his head as he looked at this old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This old man was a famous existence in the West Heaven Continent, a Perfected Earth Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, he had another more terrifying identity. He was from the West Heaven Temple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… you actually invited someone from the West Heaven Temple?!” Luo Tianshen looked at Xue Lingzi with his eyes turning red. Evidently, he never expected that Xue Lingzi would go this far to deal with their Luo God Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingzi smiled. He had paid a great price to invite this existence. And this time, no matter how Mu Chen bounced around, he would surely die here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have given you a path earlier, but you refused. And now, it’s too late!” Xue Lingzi coldly looked at Mu Chen with killing intent surging in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s because, if Senior Winter appeared, then their Blood God Clan would have to pay the price. Initially, it wasn’t something that Xue Lingzi wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingzi turned to look at Senior Winter and respectfully said, “Senior Winter, please make a move and get rid of that arrogant brat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senior Winter looked at Mu Chen without any expression. The snowflakes around him grew more violent before they tore space apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when everyone felt that Mu Chen was doomed, Senior Winter shook his head and replied with indifference, “I can’t kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingzi was stunned by his words and even thought that he had misheard things. Immediately, he forced a smile. “Senior Winter must be joking. With you, a Perfected Earth Sovereign, isn’t killing him as easy as a flip of your hand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone exchanged a look. They clearly had no idea what happened. Luo Tianshen and the rest were also looking at Mu Chen with confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, he is right. With me around, he can’t do a thing to Mu Chen…” While everyone was confused, a bright and tender laughter rang out before everyone saw a petite silhouette appearing beside Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the petite silhouette appeared, the freezing region suddenly returned to normal…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Tianshen, Xue Lingzi and the rest narrowed their pupils as they looked at that delicate silhouette in astonishment and voices of fear resounded from their lips, “A Perfected Earth Sovereign?”</span></p>
