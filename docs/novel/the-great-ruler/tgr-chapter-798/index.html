 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distant horizon, eight figures stood on the air. Although they quietly stood there without words, the vast Spiritual Energy fluctuations emanating from them were like storms that wreaked havoc on this region. It was so much so that even the thick clouds in the sky had been torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people held their breaths as the pressure from the arriving battle made them feel suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those eight figures practically represented the pinnacle existences amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region. Even amongst the various forces, their strengths could be considered the elites of the elites with boundless potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, when these elites were placed together, it would definitely be like clashes between comets that shook the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder who can ascend the peak this time…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should be Fang Yi or the Netherworld Prince… Those two have dominated the first and second rank on the Dragon-Phoenix Record for years. It’s impossible for others to shake their ranking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t say for sure, that mysterious girl is not simple and even Fang Yi is fearful of her…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not as if the others won’t have any chances. Su Biyue, Hong Yu and the rest aren’t easy opponents as well. If others underestimate them, there’s a possibility that they might capsize.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But the situation right now is in a little deadlock. After all, no one is powerful to the extent that they can disregard everyone else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stagnant atmosphere in this region could not cover up those whispers and discussions. Anyone that could arrive here wasn’t an ordinary character, they were somewhat capable so their eyesight wasn’t shallow as well. Therefore, their analysis was logical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the whispers and discussions spread out in this region, Mu Chen sensed the stagnant atmosphere in the air as his black pupils lightly flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t a stranger to the other seven before him. Aside from Cai Xiao, the remaining six were great figures in the Dragon-Phoenix Record. The one that he felt the most unfamiliar with would probably be Ding Xuan of the Spiritual Giant Clan, since he, more or less, had contact with the other six.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst those six, there wasn’t any enmity between him and Ding Xuan. He couldn’t be considered as friends or enemies with Su Biyue and Hong Yu. But as for the remaining three, they were slightly more troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing speaking about Liu Yan, who was already a life-death enemy with a relationship could never be reconciled. As for Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince, they had fought with him and Cai Xiao in the past for some matters. So, generally speaking, there was some enmity between them. However, it was unclear if that enmity was deep or shallow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this situation, even he felt that it was a little hard to act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was thinking about how to break this deadlock situation, he suddenly felt a sharp blade-like gaze shooting over, filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slightly turned his head and, as he had expected, he saw Liu Yan without any expression on his face. When the latter saw his gaze directed over, there was a sinister arc that slowly rose on his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the stagnant atmosphere, Liu Yan suddenly grasped his hand and a long spear appeared in a flash. The tip of his spear was pointed towards Mu Chen as he indifferently said, “You previously managed to escape due to a fluke. This time, you won’t have any more chances.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not the one that ran with my tail between my legs.” Mu Chen lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Liu Yan wasn’t enraged as he calmly said, “If it wasn’t for her, do you think that I would let you live?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was naturally referring to Cai Xiao. In truth, when he fought with Mu Chen the previous time, it wasn’t that he couldn’t continue the battle but he was intimidated from Cai Xiao killing Chi Xue. Thus, he had no choice but to pathetically escape. It had undoubtedly filled his heart with grievances because he believed that at that time, Mu Chen was completely exhausted as well. So if the battle continued, he would definitely be the one that would laugh till the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And in the current situation, if he fought with Mu Chen again, even Cai Xiao could not interfere. Because the others would definitely not be willing to see them joining hands together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled, “Looks like you’re intending to start from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled with indifference as he turned to everyone else, “Looks like I will act first. Does anyone else have any opinion about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, the limbs are yours and no one can stop you. However, this friend from the Great Havenlaw Domain isn’t a weakling. Liu Yan, don’t kick onto a metal plate yourself and suffer.” Hong Yu showed a pampered smiled. This little seductress of the Demon Gate spoke in a soft tone. Although she didn’t look to be helping anyone, any guy that hears her words would probably feel indignant and go all-out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else did not speak. However, they were clearly glad to watch Liu Yan deal with Mu Chen, since they knew that this deadlock situation could not continue any further. So it was a good idea to let Liu Yan have the honour to start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone else remained silent, Cai Xiao’s gaze slightly turned cold as she took a step forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she only took a step forth, it instantly attracted everyone’s attention onto her. As the most mysterious person here, everyone was extremely fearful of Cai Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan’s pupils shrank in that instant when Cai Xiao took a step forth. If Cai Xiao was to help Mu Chen at this point in time, it would definitely be unfavourable for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Miss, I don't think there’s a need to act at this point, right?” However, just when Liu Yan’s expression was unsightly while looking at Cai Xiao, Fang Yi, who had remained silent this whole time, suddenly lightly smiled as he looked at Cai Xiao and gently said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What can you do if I want to take action?” Cai Xiao coldly sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi smiled, “Then, I can only obstruct you. After all, it’s best not to break the game’s rules.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a step forth as his clothes fluttered. The space around him intensely distorted with spatial ripples vaguely appearing along with a shocking Spiritual Energy pressure spreading out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Hong Yu and the rest felt the pressure coming from Fang Yi’s body, there was an uncontrollable tremble in their eyes. Judging from the undulations, Fang Yi was already stronger than them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With just you?” Cai Xiao looked at Fang Yi as her slender fingers flickered with light once again. That slender fingers of hers contained power that could make experts like Fang Yi feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Fang Yi looked at Cai Xiao, his gaze gradually turning solemn, the Netherworld Prince suddenly took several steps forth behind Cai Xiao, forming a sandwiched situation with Fang Yi, surrounding Cai Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Plus me, is that enough?” The Netherworld Prince said with indifference as a dark light surged on his body, as if it was devouring the light in this region. His hoarse voice also made the hair of others stand on the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were countless people in this region looking at this scene, dumbfounded. Even Su Biyue, Hong Yu and the rest couldn’t help feeling shocked. Clearly, they did not imagine that the first and second ranking powerhouses on the Dragon-Phoenix Record would stand together at this moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, there weren’t many interactions between Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This region exploded in an uproar. If this fact were to leak out, who knew how many younger generations of the Northern Region would be shocked. After all, Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince were monument-like figures amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region. But, right now, the two monuments were actually joining together to deal with a single person. Furthermore, that person was just a young-looking girl!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s calm expression couldn’t help changing at this scene. He did not think that Cai Xiao’s actions of attempting to help him would actually cause Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince to gang up on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two guys against one girl. The first and second of the Dragon-Phoenix Record are pretty laughable.” Mu Chen spoke in a cold voice. He knew that Cai Xiao was mysterious and as she had said, because of the seals in her body, there was a limit to the strength that she could use. According to Mu Chen’s estimations, she should be able to win if she was to deal with either Fang Yi or the Netherworld Prince. However, if the two of them joined together, not even Cai Xiao could gain an advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince cast a glance at Mu Chen with indifference as he spoke in a hoarse voice, “You’re not qualified to interfere in this matter, talk after you win against Liu Yan. She’s in this situation because of you, if you have a backbone, then talk after you deal with your situation. Otherwise…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He briefly paused, before he swept his glance at Mu Chen with indifference. There was contempt in his eyes, since Mu Chen wasn’t on the same level as him in his head, “You’re not qualified to say this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” A deep and dark light gathered in Mu Chen’s black pupils as he stared at the Netherworld Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This entire region was silent, since everyone did not expect the situation to develop in this way. Su Biyue, Hong Yu and the rest had also wisely chosen to look after themselves. No matter what, they weren’t willing to be involved in the grudges of these few. Furthermore, in their current circumstances, they were naturally willing to watch the few of them fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao slightly turned her head as her hair fluttered in the wind. She cast a glance at the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi, before revealing a smile. Her smile was something that could even topple countries. It was so much so that even great beauties like Su Biyue and Hong Yu were inferior to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao turned her gaze to Mu Chen as she chuckled, “It’ll be a little troublesome to deal with these two. But from now on, the two of them won’t dare to move as well. I’ll give you the time equivalent to an incense stick to burn to deal with the fellow named Liu Yan and…”</span></p>
