 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A light surged in this scarlet land, greatly dismissing the darkness as the Sky Formation Emperor casually waved his hand on the ancient stone base, suppressing the terrifying will from the stone troop. Witnessing this scene, even Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli were endlessly shocked, before they felt heavily relieved. Since that silhouette could casually command the Battle Will of the stone troop, then there was no doubt in his identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Sky Formation Emperor had stated his identity, he swept his gentle gaze out in this region. The scenery still remained the same, despite all these years. But he knew that there was a great transformation in the current Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gaze of the Sky Formation Emperor stopped at the stone troop down below in the end with a flash of sorrow on his face. Back then, because they had helped him suppress the evil spirit in his body, the stone troop had willingly petrified their bodies into statues and remained here for an eternity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli exchanged a glance but they did not dare to disturb the Sky Formation Emperor, who was still reminiscing in sorrow. That’s because they knew that the latter was just a remnant spirit. If they were to anger him and cause him to dissipate, then the efforts they made to come in here would be in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the Sky Formation Emperor did not remain in that state for too long. He had raised his head a brief moment later and smiled towards Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli. “The both of you are so young but you can make it here and manage to kill the evil spirit, I’m somewhat surprised.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Junior was fortunate to retrieve a Battle Seal left behind by Senior, thus I was able to activate the battle formation that Senior had left behind. Otherwise, with just the strength of us two, how could we fight the evil spirit?” Zhantai Liuli stretched her hand out towards a shattered stone piece. It was the remnants of the stone seal that she had exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Formation Emperor raised his hand as the fragment of stone fell onto Zhantai Liuli’s hand. He gave it a look before smiling. “So it’s the Battle Stone Seal that I left behind back then. You, girl, are rather fated with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Zhantai Liuli’s eyes flashed with joy as she took a glance at Mu Chen. “Senior, if it wasn’t for his help to hold up the evil spirit this time, I might not have been able to awaken you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard that Zhantai Liuli was actually putting in a word for him, he was stunned before nodding his head towards the latter to express his gratitude. The latter wasn’t greedy and didn’t take all the efforts for herself. Her actions made him increase his favourable feeling for her. This Zhantai Liuli’s character was much better than Xiao Tian’s, she was definitely a person worth interacting with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Formation Emperor laughed, then said with deep meaning in his words, “Although I was in a slumber, I know everything that has happened. If you had taken all the credit for yourself, perhaps I would have despised you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His laughter contained admiration. Clearly, Zhantai Liuli’s unintentional actions had gained favourable points from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli and Mu Chen exchanged a glance and the former inwardly patted her ample chest, rejoicing, and even caused Mu Chen to smile. Removing her Commander’s identity, she was just a lady that’s slightly older than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m someone that’s supposed to be dead. Since you guys can make it here, that means that we are fated. Although according to the rules, the inheritance of Battle Formation Master can only be passed down to a single person, since I am about to disappear, all these rules aren’t valid.” Sky Formation Emperor slowly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli rejoiced in their hearts. Shortly after, they figured out why the information regarding Battle Formation Masters was so rare. It turned out that they were only passed down from one generation to the next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The two of you have pretty decent talent in Battle Will, pretty good saplings with qualifications to become Battle Formation Masters,” said the Sky Formation Emperor, which made joy surge on Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli’s faces. Through the twist and turns, weren’t they aiming at the information of Battle Formation Masters by entering the Death Ruin despite the dangers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Battle Formation Masters are born out of Spiritual Array Masters. But due to the fact that they’re on different paths. A Spiritual Array Master controls the energy of the heavens and earth, while a Battle Formation Master relies on the power of labour…” The Sky Formation Emperor’s aged voice slowly rang out in this dark region with Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli paying attention to his speech. They did not dare to slack from any part because any information related to Battle Formation Masters was too rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But the requirements to become a Battle Formation Master is extremely harsh. If ordinary experts have a slightly stronger will, they can command the Battle Will of a troop. But they have their limits and it’s hard for them to beat quantity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli both silently nodded their heads. There were many that could command Battle Wills, the Commanders of the various troops could achieve that. But the amount of Battle Will that they could control was limited. That’s because, when Battle Will reached a certain limit, their will wouldn’t be able to control it anymore. If they were to forcefully control it, they would be devoured by it instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason behind this isn’t tough to guess. It’s just the Battle Will being weak or strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Formation Emperor faintly said, “And the energy of wills is different to Spiritual Energy. It is formless, without shape. It’s illusory with nothing in it. It’s hard for an ordinary person to come in contact with it. Generally speaking, the strength of their wills is something that they’re born with. But despite their talents, it’s impossible for them to command the wills of a troop numbered in a million.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, why could Battle Formation Masters control troops numbered in a million or even tens of millions?” Zhantai Liuli couldn’t help asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sky Formation Emperor lightly smiled. “That’s because a Battle Formation Master can cultivate their will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivate the will?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli practically squinted at the same time, with splendour or disbelief on their countenances. Such a mysterious and illusory thing like will could also be cultivated?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why have they not heard of such matters before?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, how… how can the will be cultivated?” Zhantai Liuli asked in disbelief. Wills were illusory and without shapes that ordinary experts could not come in contact with, not to mention cultivating it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Life forms between the heavens and earth can cultivate, so why can’t will?” The Sky Formation Emperor popped a question instead of answering it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli and Mu Chen exchanged a glance and they were speechless. They could only bitterly smile in disbelief. The Sky Formation Emperor was the expert, so he was naturally an expert in this field. So despite how they found it hard to believe, they could only accept the reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To every Battle Formation Master, the method to cultivate their will is extremely precious. Since the Primordial Age, methods of cultivating wills are extremely rare. If it wasn’t for them having only an inheritor for each generation, it wouldn’t be passed down so easily.” The Sky Formation Emperor continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was speechless. So the inheritance of Battle Formation Masters turned out to be so tightly sealed. It was no wonder why that after the tribulation in the Primordial Age, the amount of Battle Formation Masters was so small. Their inheritances were all tightly sealed, so it was hard for them to be widely spread out in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s not the reason why Battle Formation Masters are rare. It’s because the path of cultivating will is extremely dangerous. If the cultivation fails, the will of that person would go into chaos and suffer irreparable damage to their consciousness. Therefore, if they did not find a suitable person, they wouldn’t easily pass down the cultivation method. Otherwise, who could take it if one died after another after passing it down?” The Sky Formation Emperor gently sighed. He must’ve been feeling sour in his heart because of the difficulty of passing down the Battle Formation Master’s methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things like will were illusory, even many powerhouses felt unfamiliar with it. Therefore, the majority of their wills were maintained at the most initial state. If they suffered heavy injuries and resulted in their consciousness going chaotic, it was a price that would make one fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli’s faces had turned solemn. They must have been startled by how dangerous the Will Techniques were. After all, if it was a Divine Art, it’s fine if they failed. But as for the Will Techniques, it’s fine if they managed to succeed. But if they failed, they would be reduced to a retard…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s something that not everyone would dare to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, at the same time, when Mu Chen felt fearful in his heart, he also felt rather wonderful. This Great Thousand World was filled with all sorts of mysteries. Although Spiritual Energy was fundamental, there were also other extraordinary figures that managed to open up other channels. And if one managed to reach the limit of those channels, they wouldn’t be weaker than those on the path of Spiritual Energy. It’s just that their focus wasn’t the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have told the two of you the risks of Will Techniques. Are you guys still willing to continue?” The Sky Formation Emperor said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli balled her fists as she firmly nodded her head. Her talent in Spiritual Energy wasn’t outstanding, so even if she bitterly cultivated for her entire life, it was tough for her to gain any achievement in that field. So if she wanted to become a genuine expert with the power to protect her own clansmen, she would have to walk to path of a Battle Formation Master.</span></p>
