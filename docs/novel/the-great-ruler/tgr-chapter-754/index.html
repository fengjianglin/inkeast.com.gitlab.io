Hissing sounds constantly rang out, which made others feel their scalps numbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at this scene, even someone with Mu Chen’s state of mind couldn’t help having his expression turn stiff. Although, judging from the sizes of the Spiritual Fire Pythons here, a majority of them should be less than a century old. But it was those handfuls that could not be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it might have looked easy for Mu Chen to hunt that 100-year-old Spiritual Fire Pythons earlier, he had used the entire force of the Great Solar Undying Body without holding back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, it would be tough if he had to face this amount of Spiritual Fire Pythons, even if he had the Great Solar Undying Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t this a little too hard, all of a sudden?!” Mu Chen gave a somewhat stiff smile. Although he had confidence, he wasn’t arrogant. He did not believe that he could deal with so many Spiritual Fire Pythons that easily just by his own power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These monsters weren’t made of clay.</span></p>

If you want to challenge the Nine-nine Blaze Dragon Array three months from now, then you need to train with this method.” Bing Qing crossed her arms against her chest. The soft fabric outlined her voluptuous arc and a ridiculing smile hung on the corner of her lips as she stared at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Naturally, this is only my suggestion and the choice is yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s lips slightly twitched. Since it was already said to this point, how could he reject?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Qing saw the helpless expression on Mu Chen’s face and she smiled. “Alright, you will stay here to train. It there’s anything, you can look for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finishing her words, she turned around and left. As light flickered, it only took several breaths before she disappeared from his sight, leaving Mu Chen here, alone, as he speechlessly looked at the blazing magma ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen bitterly smiled for a long time, before regaining his composure. Grumbling and complaining to the heavens wasn’t his character. Since he came, then he would definitely persevere, no matter how tough it would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen deeply inhaled a mouthful of blazing air. As the air went into his lungs, he felt the burn within his body. That pain had also gradually made his black pupils turn sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stared at the scarlet magma. After a brief observation, he could tell that although there was a considerable amount of Spiritual Fire Pythons in the magma, their distribution wasn’t regulated. There were places with Spiritual Fire Pythons densely packed together, with other places having few in number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Mu Chen’s current strength, he could deal with two or three Spiritual Fire Pythons that were over a hundred years old. But if the amount increased, he would have to flee for his life as well. Thus, before he could completely get used to this place, he should proceed from shallow to deep…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it here, Mu Chen no longer hesitated and tapped his feet, before his figure mysteriously appeared at a corner of the magma ocean. He floated in the air a few tens of feet above the magma ocean, then carefully stepped onto the air above the magma ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen entered the range of the magma ocean, there were nearly a dozen Spiritual Fire Pythons that were swimming in the magma that sensed his approach. Instantly, the magma was torn apart and the pythons turned into streaks of scarlet light as they swiftly pounced towards Mu Chen, brandishing their ferocious fangs with blazing magma flowing within. It was extremely lethal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any change in Mu Chen’s expression as his body swiftly turned into lightning with nine lightning runes appearing on his chest. He brandished his fist forth as a thunderous explosion rang out. A dozen lightning storms swept out, clashing with the dozen Spiritual Fire Pythons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only were those Spiritual Fire Pythons incomparable to the one that Mu Chen had hunted before, so they must’ve been only a few decades in age. So their attacks didn’t have much of a threat in Mu Chen’s eyes. When the lightning swept out, the dozen Spiritual Fire Pythons were turned into magma as they burst apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen waved his hand as a dozen Spiritual Fire Marrows flew over and were swiftly stored by him. His expression turned grave because the fluctuation from before had already been swept out. Right now, there were numerous magma torrents that abruptly swept out from the surface of the magma ocean. Under those torrents were actually ferocious Spiritual Fire Pythons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, there were a few that were especially large in size. Clearly, they had already reached a hundred years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huge magma waves swept up as piercing hissing cries spread out. Numerous gazes that contained blazing magma penetrated through space as they pounced towards Mu Chen in every direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this scale of an attack, Mu Chen did not dare to hesitate. He willed in his heart and condensed the Great Solar Undying Body. Golden light circulated, allowing the magma beams to attack its massive figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Splash! Splash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the attacks of these Spiritual Fire Pythons were violent, the defence of Mu Chen’s Great Solar Undying Body itself was not only stunning, but it also received the enhancement of Greatlaw Goldpond. Thus, those attacks could only leave behind burning marks on the surface of its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Mu Chen’s control, the Great Solar Undying Body had unleashed a massacre. Under the slamming of the huge golden palms, it had directly pierced through the magma and grabbed onto two ferocious Spiritual Fire Pythons, crushing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the movement of the Great Solar Undying Body, the typical Spiritual Fire Pythons that were decades in age were instantly killed by him. Only those with larger figures that were over a hundred years old, whose strengths were comparable to Third Grade Sovereigns, could withstand Mu Chen’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Spiritual Fire Pythons did not have any intelligence, they had an advantage in quantity. Thus, they endlessly pounced at the Great Solar Undying Body in every direction. Mu Chen had also sensed the swift exhaustion of his Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so much so that even the dazzling golden light on the Great Solar Undying Body was dimming down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge palm of the Great Solar Undying Body pierced through the magma and grabbed onto a 100-year-old Spiritual Fire Python before pulling and tearing it apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A scarlet Spiritual Fire Marrow flew out and was harvested by Mu Chen, who was hidden within the Great Solar Undying Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just two hours, he had already killed five Spiritual Fire Pythons that were over a hundred years old. As for those under a century in age, there were dozens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the price of this achievement was the dazzling golden light of the Great Solar Undying Body that turned especially dim because of the exhaustion of Spiritual Energy. Such endless battles were even more exhausting to the Spiritual Energy than his battle with Qin Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because at this point in time, Mu Chen did not dare to relax in the slightest, since he had to circulate the Spiritual Energy in his body without holding back. Otherwise, if he were to let those eyeing Spiritual Fire Pythons grab ahold of a loophole, he would definitely be defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this sort of time, those weaker Spiritual Fire Pythons no longer dared to get too close. Therefore, a majority of those that were launching attacks at Mu Chen were all Spiritual Fire Pythons that had exceeded a century-long lifespan. Sometimes, Mu Chen even had to deal with the dreadful attacks of eight Spiritual Fire Pythons that had exceed the lifespan of a century.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such battles with high burdens were swiftly exhausting his Spiritual Energy. Gradually, Mu Chen started to have issues holding on.</span></p>

This sort of exhaustion only needed another half an hour before signs of Spiritual Energy exhaustion would appear in his Sovereign Sea.</span></p>

Because he sensed that the Spiritual Energy within his body was more active than usual.</span></p>

These were the Spiritual Fire Marrow that he had previously obtained. He looked at these lumps of scarlet light and tossed them into his mouth without any hesitation.</span></p>

Normally, when someone wanted to refine it, they would look for a quiet place to refine it. As for those like Mu Chen, who dared to refine it during battle, they were few in number.</span></p>

However, he clenched his teeth from the pain with traces of fresh blood seeping out from the gap between his teeth. However, he didn’t seem to have any intention of stopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He circulated the Great Pagoda Art as he refined the Spiritual Energy in his body. Thereafter, he controlled the Great Solar Undying Body to dodge the ferocious attacks.</span></p>

Thereafter, the corner of his lips gradually rose into an arc.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Qing, Tie Shan and the rest of the four Commanders of the Great Havenlaw Army, as well as the many warriors, had raised their heads as they looked at Mu Chen, who had sunk into a bitter battle, and lightly curled their lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a reckless fellow, judging from the looks of this, I might have to rescue him later. Truly a fellow that doesn’t know his limits and not retreating even at this point in time.” Bing Qing said with dissatisfaction. Initially, Mu Chen still had the sufficient amount of Spiritual Energy to break out from the encirclement, but he did not retreat, no matter what. Now that he was surrounded by more and more Spiritual Fire Pythons, there was only one outcome for Mu Chen, if this went on. His Spiritual Energy would be completely exhausted and he would be torn apart by those Spiritual Fire Pythons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other three Commanders had nodded their heads as well. From the looks of it, Mu Chen didn’t seem to be a reckless person, so why would he do something like this?</span></p>

But just when her feet were about to move, a low uproar abruptly spread out on the stone platform.</span></p>

Immediately, her ice-cold pupils suddenly narrowed.</span></p>
