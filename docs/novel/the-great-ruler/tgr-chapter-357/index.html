 <p><strong>Chapter 357 - Relation</strong></p>
 <p>“Mother…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s exceedingly hoarse voice rang out within this speckless bamboo house, before causing the two people within the bamboo house to suddenly turn quiet.</p>
 <p>With extreme astonishment, Ling Xi tilted her head and stared at Mu Chen, as if she was still doubtful as to what she had heard. The figure of the lady within the painting, she was actually Mu Chen’s mother?</p>
 <p>An extremely complicated feeling started to unknowingly rise within her heart. This feeling was unable to be explained using words; however, it made her feel somewhat stifled within her heart.</p>
 <p>“Are you saying that she’s your mother?” slightly raising her eyebrows, she asked while pointing towards the paint with her slender and jade-like finger.</p>
 <p>A surge went through Mu Chen’s gaze as he stared at Ling Xi. At this moment, unconcealable emotions surged within his eyes as he replied, “Elder Ling Xi, where did you get this painting from? Do you recognise the lady in this painting?”</p>
 <p>For the last few years, this was the first time he had managed to obtain any information regarding his mother. Although the figure in the painting was extremely blurry, there was an unquestionable feeling that she was definitely his mother.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing his questions, her beautiful gaze turned slightly blank and vacant. Shaking her head, she replied, “I, too, don’t know about it…I only know that she’s extremely important to me. However, a problem seems to have appeared within my memories, because I’ve forgotten about a lot of things. I’ve also forgotten about her…”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore… how could she be your mother?”</p>
 <p>Although there were problems with her memory, an unknown feeling that stemmed from the deepest part of her heart made her feel inconceivable as she stared at Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>“Although I’ve never seen my Mother before, I can confirm that I’ve definitely not made a mistake.” replied Mu Chen resolutely and decisively. That was a feeling that stemmed from the closeness of their bloodline. This was something that was absolutely correct, even though he had never seen his mother since he was young. The only thing left was a remnant shadow of a gentle figure within the deepest parts of his memory.</p>
 <p>“You’ve never seen her before?”</p>
 <p>For some unknown reason, Ling Xi quietly breathed a sigh of relief. However, in the next instant, her expression became complicated, since she felt as if she was one of two kids fighting over who their most favourite sweet would belong to.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head, before replying in a soft voice, “She had left when I was very young.”</p>
 <p>He didn't go into the details; after all, this was considered to be a family matter, and it was not needed for other people to know.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ling Xi, do you truly not have even the slightest bit of information about her?” Mu Chen could not help asking as he looked towards Ling Xi. After finally obtaining some news after so much difficulty, he wouldn’t let it easily slip out of his grasp.</p>
 <p>Sitting on the praying mat, Ling Xi continued to look towards the figure of the lady within the black pagoda and replied, “My memories came to a halt to five years ago. After that, it becomes extremely blurry. I think it should be the handiwork if someone…”</p>
 <p>Speaking until there, Ling Xi’s voice became extremely cold and frosty, while hatred filled her words. If she knew the person who had done this to her, she would definitely kill that person!</p>
 <p>“However, I can occasionally feel some fragments of my memories. Many, many years ago, I should have been together with her… I also know that she’s a very important person to me. Therefore, regardless of anything, I want to recover my memories…” Ling Xi muttered to herself while looking at the lady within the picture in a daze.</p>
 <p>Hearing her muttering, Mu Chen gawked, before staring at Ling Xi. <em>Unexpectedly, she’s been together with Mother in the past? Exactly what relationship does she have with Mother?</em></p>
 <p>While Mu Chen was still in a daze, Ling Xi had turned her head around, sending a slightly odd gaze towards him.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Mu Chen gave a dry laugh. In the next moment, his face turned somewhat green as he spoke out, “You really better not tell me that you’re my long-lost sister or whatever…Me and my dad might not be able to endure such shocking news.”</p>
 <p>However, upon hearing his words, Ling Xi had truly thought about it, before asking, “Should we test it by dripping blood?”</p>
 <p>Black lines instantly covered Mu Chen’s face as he replied, “Don’t fool around. That’s useless.”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the sweat-filled appearance of Mu Chen, Ling Xi could not help letting off a gentle laugh. At this moment, the cold and detached expression on her beautiful face had completely disappeared, causing her to appear exceedingly alluring.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll not tease you.” replied Ling Xi, “As of now, we’re both not clear of the precise situation of this matter. However, I think that there would definitely be a chance to completely solve this mystery.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen faintly nodded his head, although there was still some unease within his heart. If what Ling Xi said was true, that she was at his mother’s side in the past, why did she suddenly leave? Furthermore, why did Ling Xi’s memories get wiped? Could it be that they were met with some very big trouble, and was his mother still well, as of now?</p>
 <p>“Now, can you tell me about the black pagoda within your body? If I’m right, she also possessed it…”said Ling Xi as she pointed towards the painting.</p>
 <p>Remaining silent for a while longer, Mu Chen finally nodded his head. There was an unknown feeling telling him that the Ling Xi before him was worthy to be trusted. Although this feeling might be related to his mother, it was a simple decision for him to make the selection to trust her.</p>
 <p>“The cultivation technique that I’m practising is called the Great Pagoda Art. This was something that was left to me by my Mother, before she left. As for this black pagoda, it should be something that appears after cultivating in this technique.”</p>
 <p>Tilting his head, Mu Chen continued, “However, its might isn’t as strong as I’ve imagine. Although, its defense is very strong, and is able to protect me.”</p>
 <p>“Great Pagoda Art?”</p>
 <p>Hearing those three words, a flash of brilliance appeared within Ling Xi’s eyes. Standing up, fluctuations appeared within her expression as this name gave an unknown feeling of familiarity within her.</p>
 <p>Taking two steps forward, she appeared before Mu Chen. Extending her icy-cold jade-like hands, she grasped his hands, before linking their palms and ten fingers together.</p>
 <p>Her lands appeared slender and fair, and was smaller than Mu Chen’s by a size, which was just nice for Mu Chen to turn around and grasp hers. Naturally, as of now, Mu Chen would obviously not dare to do such a thing, with the only thing he could do was to suit her wishes.</p>
 <p>“Don’t resist.”</p>
 <p>When Ling Xi’s palms were touching Mu Chen’s, she spoke out in a soft voice. In the next instant, a wave of boundless Spiritual Energy erupted from her palms. Conveniently flowing through Mu Chen’s palms, it entered his meridians, before unexpectedly making contact with Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was instantly shocked, since this was an extremely dangerous thing to do. The Spiritual Energy produced from various forms of cultivations were all different. Once they made contact with one another, intense repulsion would erupt from them, causing extremely serious damage towards both parties.</p>
 <p>However, just as Mu Chen was hesitating to break the contact off, the two Spiritual Energies came into contact. In the next instant, something that caused Mu Chen’s heart and mind to tremble started to happen…</p>
 <p>As the two Spiritual Energies made contact, the repulsion that he had imagined did not appear. Instead, the two Spiritual Energies had actually started to fuse together.</p>
 <p>As the fused Spiritual Energy surged within Mu Chen’s body, he discovered, with a shock, that the heavy injuries that he had suffered earlier were actually starting to recover at an astonishing speed.</p>
 <p>After a short span of less than ten minutes, the injuries within Mu Chen’s body were completely healed… the rate of recovery caused Mu Chen to turn dumbfounded by the sight before him. Even with his small accomplishment to his Thunder God Physique, he would need to rest and recuperate for at least an entire day to recover from the injuries that he had previously suffered.</p>
 <p>In shock, Mu Chen raised his head, and looked in disbelief towards the Ling Xi in front of him. At this moment, the bafflement within his heart was getting increasingly thicker. Why would this happen?</p>
 <p>Only when all the injuries on Mu Chen’s body had completely recovered did the fused Spiritual Energy start to slowly dissociate, bit by bit. After that, the wave of Spiritual Energy travelled through his meridians, before reentering Ling Xi’s body.</p>
 <p>As the Spiritual Energy returned to Ling Xi’s body, her delicate figure faintly shivered, before a faint reddish hue surfaced on her skin. Withdrawing her jade-like hands, her long eyelashes started to faintly flutter.</p>
 <p>“How could it do that?” Unable to hold it back, Mu Chen asked aloud. After his Spiritual Energy had fused with Ling Xi’s Spiritual Energy, why would it possess such strong regenerative power?</p>
 <p>In a soft voice, Ling Xi replied, “It’s because I’ve previously cultivated the Great Pagoda Art…”</p>
 <p>A faint shudder went through Mu Chen’s heart and mind as he thought, <em>Ling Xi has actually cultivated the Great Pagoda Art?</em> From the looks of it now, those words that she had previously said were definitely true.</p>
 <p>However, could it be that people that have cultivated the Great Pagoda Art would be able to fuse their Spiritual Energies? This should be impossible! Even considering both parties had cultivated the same kind of Spiritual Art, the Spiritual Energy cultivated by everyone would have differences present within. Thus, they wouldn’t be able to achieve such a perfect degree of fusion.</p>
 <p>However, why would they be able to fuse their Spiritual Energies to such a degree?</p>
 <p>After thinking for a long time, he was still unable to get the slightest clue about it, and could only give up in helplessness. The bodies of the two of them seemed to be hiding some secrets, and these secrets should have ties to Mu Chen’s mother.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Mu Chen gazed towards the figure of the lady within the painting that made people feel calm and peaceful, before gently sighing in his heart. <em>Mother, exactly what is this all about…?</em></p>
 <p>“Let it be, don’t get frustrated over this. All secrets will be revealed at one point. Although my memories have been tampered by someone, following the increase of my strength, I’ll one day be able to retrieve all of my memories back. At that time, I’ll be able to know exactly what had happened to me in the past.” Seeing Mu Chen frowning and pondering in deep thought, Ling Xi consoled him in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head, before feeling slightly unnatural. In the past few periods of time, he had already gotten used to Ling Xi’s cold and detached treatment towards him. However, with the sudden gentleness, he truly wasn’t used to it.</p>
 <p>“In addition, the Great Pagoda Art isn’t as simple as you think. That black pagoda isn’t as weak as you imagined. The only thing resulting in that is due to you still being unable to touch on that marvelous point.”</p>
 <p>Ling Xi started her warning, “Also, its best to reveal the black pagoda as little as possible. Although I’ve lost quite a lot of my memories, I’m able to feel that this thing would lure some very dangerous things if it’s exposed. Therefore, if it’s been discovered…you might end up with a lot of trouble.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen pulled his head back. The consideration and care shown by Ling Xi truly made him feel slightly terrified.</p>
 <p>“Okay.”</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, he could only nodded his head.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Let’s head out of here first.” Looking once again at the painting on the wall, Ling Xi spoke out.</p>
 <p>Hearing her instructions, Mu Chen nodded his head. Looking fondly at the blurry figure of the lady within the painting, he truly wished to take that painting away. However, it was obviously something that was extremely important to Ling Xi. Therefore, it would not be good for him to hog everything for himself.</p>
 <p>“Mother, I’ve promised Dad that I’ll definitely find you.”</p>
 <p>Looking towards the figure of the lady once again, Mu Chen took a deep breath of air, before turning and leaving the bamboo house.</p>
 <p>As the two left the bamboo house, the atmosphere around them turned silent. In a short span of less than half a day, they had suffered an extremely huge emotional impact. From being originally having not the slightest bit of relationship, to a relationship so deep it was even binding…</p>
 <p>Although they didn’t talk about it, when their Spiritual Energies had perfectly fused, the two of them already knew that their relationship wasn’t that simple after all.</p>
 <p>“Ling Xi…Elder Ling Xi.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen finally broke the silence, before saying her name with some unnaturalness.</p>
 <p>“Just call me Ling Xi.” Ling Xi replied after a moment of hesitation.</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Mu Chen also faintly hesitated. Nodding his head, his said, “I’ll come back tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>Ling Xi nodded her small head.</p>
 <p>Looking at the current situation, Mu Chen didn’t continue talking anymore. Just as he had turned around to leave, something went into his mind as he raised his head. He looked towards the northern position of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. There, in the middle of a giant hall, a scarlet red pillar of light suddenly rushed towards the sky. At the same time, an ear-piercing and urgent bell rang out, resounding across the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Such an urgent bell ring caused Mu Chen to gawk. Casting his gaze towards the direction of the sounds origin, it seemed to be the location of the Missions Hall. Exactly what had happened?</p>
