At this moment, an imposing figure appeared out of the pitch-black vortex that could make the heart of others race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That silhouette was initially gigantic, but when that figure appeared, it returned to normal size, and every single eye in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was looking at it in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an elderly man with white hair and beard, donned in black robes. His face was aged, but there was a heart-racing prestige emitting from him, even the space around him was faintly trembling from that prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire earth and sky seemed to be submitting beneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable pressure enveloped over, causing the ecstatic atmosphere in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to turn silent in an instant. Not only students, but even some Elders had their faces paled as they looked at that figure. The pressure was something that they had not felt before. It was so much so that even Lord Northern Sea, the most powerful existence in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, did not possess such suffocating pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just what was the identity of that man to be so compelling to such an extent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the horizon far away, the space vortex wiggled. After the appearance of this deity-like elder, light appeared once again from the vortex, which was followed with deep roars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone saw hundreds of enormous silver cranes flapping their wings, covered in violent lightning as they passed through the vortex and quietly hovered behind the black-robed elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone realised that on those cranes, there were knights donning silver armour and holding large silver spears. Although they had remained silent, a heavy killing aura swept out from their bodies, showing that they were a mighty army. The formation they had made the faces of innumerable students turn pale. Those knights riding on those lightning cranes had undoubtedly undergone countless life and death battles, a genuine army, not a regular army that was loose and disorganised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this army launched their attacks, not even a Sovereign expert would withstand their assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood up with a heavy expression, while looking at the black-robed elder, as well as the army behind him. Those lightning cranes should be Lightning Eater Cranes, ranking 24th on the Spiritual Beast Records. With so many of them here, it showed how fearsome the Luo God Clan was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this mysterious group appeared, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was clearly intimidated by it. However, the academy side swiftly reacted as screeches of wind rang out along with the Elders rushing over, cautiously looking at that group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind those Elders, large groups from the Punishment Hall also had their guards up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even when facing the guard from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, the group of people did not move. The black-robed elder that stood in front swept his glance about, before fixing it at a specific direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that direction, there was a slender, elegant and outstanding beauty quietly standing there as she looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the girl, a faint gentle smile that was hard to detect appeared on the face of the dignified elder. A moment later, he shifted his gaze onto Mu Chen, who stood beside Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there was a considerable distance between them, Mu Chen felt a dreadful pressure enveloping him through the space in that instant. That pressure even created faint cracks on the stone beneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the range of that pressure was perfectly controlled, aside from the area he stood, there wasn’t any pressure that leaked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li seemed to have sensed it with her keen senses as she slightly knitted her brows and was about to move forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen extended his hand and held onto her wrist and lightly shook his head. He knew that if he needed Luo Li to stand before him during their first meeting, that Patriarch of the Luo God Clan would be thoroughly disappointed in him, or perhaps he didn’t have much expectations for himself in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s expression was calm, only Luo Li, who had her hand held by him, could feel the faint trembling. Sweat seeped from his back, drenching his clothes in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pressure coming from an Earth Sovereign was just too frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Luo Tianshen had any intentions to kill, Mu Chen would probably be slaughtered in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no matter how much pressure he felt, Mu Chen still maintained a calm expression. The pressure lasted for merely two minutes but had made Mu Chen feel a little numbness in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, when the pressure was suddenly withdrawn, Mu Chen realised that he could move his body, and because of the strength behind his grip, it left behind a mark on Luo Li’s fair wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distant sky, Luo Tianshen gradually retracted his gaze and faintly said, “He does have some endurance, not as bad as I thought.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Luo Tianshen, there were two Lightning Eater Cranes that were closer to him, which had two men on them. Judging from their appearances, their ages were roughly twenty-seven or twenty-eight. They were donned in silver armour as they emitted cool dispositions. Their temperaments weren’t ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the status of those two wasn’t low, but they didn’t seem to be close to each other as they maintained a distance apart and did not speak. However, the killing aura concealed in the centre of their brows made them seem like restrained asuras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those knights behind them saw the back silhouettes of those two, the revere emitting from the depths of their hearts was revealed in their eyes. Clearly, those two guys weren’t ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they heard Luo Tianshen’s faint voice, there was a ripple in their initially calmed eyes. They directed their gazes over to that direction, looking a little curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, there was a light silhouette that soared towards the horizon. Seeing the arrival of Dean Tai Cang, their expressions were heavy as they looked at Luo Tianshen and did not speak. A familiar laughter then rang out in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, what rare guests we have. I never expected the Luo God Clan to come to our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. It was inconsiderate of me not to have received you guys.” Next to Dean Tai Cang, there was a slightly crooked elderly figure that appeared, he was the Northern Sea Dragon of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When every student saw the arrival of the Northern Sea Dragon, they felt inwardly relieved. That figure was the real pillar of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Tianshen had also shifted his gaze over when the Northern Sea Dragon appeared as a smear of astonishment surfaced in his eyes. From the looks of it, he seemed to have sensed the strength possessed by the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The latter was similarly at Earth Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be Sire Northern Sea of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, right? I am Luo Tiansheng, I hope you don’t blame me for my impromptu visit.” Luo Tianshen said with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it’s the Patriarch of the Luo God Clan, it’s an honour to meet you at last.” The Northern Sea Dragon cupped his hands with a smile hung on his face as he restrained a lot of his worldly despise from earlier and became a little solemn. Although he was also in the Earth Sovereign Realm, he understood that there was still a considerable distance between him and Luo Tianshen. After all, the latter had been at the Earth Sovereign Realm for a long time, while he had just broken through to this realm a year ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Luo Tianshen’s reputation was resonating, his was still mediocre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Patriarch Luo, I wonder what matter do you have to visit our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy?” Seeing the appearance of the Northern Sea Dragon, Dean Tai Cang also felt relief in his heart as he spoke politely with his hands cupped together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m here to bring my granddaughter back, I believe the two of you won’t obstruct me in this, right?” Luo Tianshen spoke as he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Tai Cang and the Northern Sea Dragon exchanged a glance as they looked at the direction of the Goddess Luo Association. In the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, there was probably only that girl that could be associated with the Luo God Clan. However, they never imagined that Luo Li was the granddaughter of Luo Tianshen, which also implied that she’s the next Empress of the Luo God Clan…</span></p>
