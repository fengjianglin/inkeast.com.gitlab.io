The abyss was like a demonic dragon lurking deep underground that would send chills down the spine of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Demonic Lightning Abyss.” Nine Nether looked at the black abyss with her expression turning a little grave. “The Demonic Earth Lightning is born underground, it is a very special lightning. Although it is lightning, it can communicate with the earth. When activated, it can easily rupture the earth, causing destruction similar to that of an earthquake.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. He had cultivated the Lightning God’s Physique and had bitterly trained in the Lightning Territory of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy in the past, so he was rather familiar with lightning energy. Thus, he could also sense the terrifying lightning energy gathered in the Demonic Lightning Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Demonic Earth Lightning was powerful, it was a level below the Undying Flames. If it was used to integrate into Spiritual Energy, it would definitely be destroyed by the Undying Flames instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he had to find a lightning energy that was equal to the Undying Flames, and this Demonic Earth Lightning had clearly not reached that level yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the Demonic Earth Lightning wasn’t Mu Chen’s target, it was the more powerful Nether Demon Heart Lightning that was hidden deeper underground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But the Nether Demon Heart Lightning is so powerful, even if we can find it, it will definitely not be easy to integrate with it.” Mu Chen spoke after a brief ponder. Back then, when he integrated the Undying Flames, he had exerted all his energy in order to accomplish it. Now that he wanted to integrate with the Nether Demon Heart Lightning, it would definitely be tougher and more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you manage to integrate it, your Spiritual Energy will have the attributes of both lightning and fire. At that time, the power won’t be something that ordinary Spiritual Energy could compare to.” Nine Nether smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Naturally, true power isn’t something that depends on how powerful the Spiritual Energy attributes are. Take the Flame Emperor of the Endless Fire Territory, for example. In terms of playing with fire, there isn’t anyone that can be comparable to him in the Great Thousand World. He’s the genuine emperor of flames, every flame can be easily controlled by him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Focusing on one attribute is more powerful?” Mu Chen asked. The Flame Emperor could be considered as someone that had cultivated the path of flames to the extreme. Upon reaching his level, all other energies weren’t enough to waver his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s not true as well. There are endless profundities between the heavens and earth. There isn’t one that is more powerful. Rumour has it that the Martial Ancestor himself possesses many attributes in his Spiritual Energy. Not only is it proficient in lightning and flame, he even displayed the power of Extreme Ice back when he barged into the Ice Spirit Clan. Even such an ancient clan like the Ice Spirit Clan that is proficient in the energy of ice lost to him.” Nine Nether said, shaking her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Martial Ancestor? There are so many attributes in his Spiritual Energy?” Mu Chen was stunned as he recalled Lin Jing, who he had encounter back in the Merchant Continent. The Martial Ancestor must be her father, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumour has it that the Lower Plane he belongs to is special. Although the Great Thousand World has countless planes connected to it, there are also some Lower Planes that are worth commending. Some special cultivation arts that aren’t ordinary, even in the Great Thousand World.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether lightly smiled. “So there isn’t one strongest cultivation path, only the most suitable cultivation path. As long as you can find your own path, you can even compete with those Heavenly Sovereigns in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head, but bitterly smiled shortly after. “But those things are too far to speak of. We have yet to even find the Nether Demon Heart Lightning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the Demonic Lightning Abyss with slight nervousness. Originally, he still had quite a bit of hope, but when he found out that the Demonic Lightning Sect, who had occupied this location for so many years, had yet to find the Nether Demon Heart Lightning, his hope fell to the bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demonic Lightning Sect couldn’t even find it after so much effort, how could he be so lucky to bump into it the moment he comes here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter what, we still have to give it a try,” said Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head as he exchanged a glance with Nine Nether. The two of them turned into two streaks of light as they descended down the Demonic Lightning Abyss. Wind whizzed as darkness swiftly devoured the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep thunderous roars constantly came out from the depths of the darkness. The speed of Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s descent was extremely fast, they had already gone down ten thousand feet in barely ten breath’s time, before they started to slow down their speed. Because they sensed that after reaching this depth, the lightning energy was getting more violent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether stood in place, before Mu Chen flicked his finger. Spiritual Energy light balls gradually rose from his finger and swiftly swelled up. Dazzling light burst out as it expelled the darkness in the depths of this Demonic Lightning Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Darkness retreated as the surrounding scenery was swiftly clearing up. Mu Chen directed his gaze over and couldn’t help narrowing his eyes. The wall of the abyss was filled with densely packed holes that were roughly a few feet in size. In those black holes, there were greyish-black lightning bolts that looked like snakes as they shuttled back and forth, letting out thunderous roars that caused the earth to shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those greyish-black lightning bolts were the so-called “Demonic Earth Lightning”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this abyss, which was filled with Demonic Earth Lightning, violent fluctuations were being emitted, causing even space to show signs of distortion. When the Spiritual Energy light balls appeared, the lightning bolts abruptly sensed invaders and countless lightning beams burst out from those black holes, sweeping towards Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing this, Mu Chen’s party of two did not panic as Nine Nether raised her hand and purple flames enveloped the two of them. No matter how the Demonic Earth Lightning shot over, it was burned to nothingness by the Undying Flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look below.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether wasn’t bothered with the disturbance of the Demonic Earth Lightning. Her slender finger was pointed down with a grave expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lowered his head to look at it and flicked his finger, sending a Spiritual Energy light ball towards the black abyss. The light ball exploded as countless sparks of light swept out, lighting up the area below them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hisss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen got a clear look at the situation below, he immediately, uncontrollably inhaled a mouthful of chilled air. Deep in the dark, greyish-black lightning seemed to have formed into an ocean that was spread out at the bottom of the Demonic Lightning Abyss. The pitch-black scenery was like a dark portal that went to another world, letting those that laid eyes on it to feel their scalps numbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This lightning ocean was actually formed entirely of Demonic Earth Lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder the Demonic Lightning Sect could not find the Nether Demon Heart Lightning after so many years.” Mu Chen sighed. Who would have thought that the Demonic Earth Lightning that was in the depths of the Demonic Lightning Abyss would be so numerous? Even someone like Qin Tiangang, who had a cultivation of Fifth Grade Sovereign, would not rush in so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether nodded her head, before she lightly frowned her brows. “Looks like we can only go down into this lightning ocean that is formed from Demonic Earth Lightning to look for the Nether Demon Heart Lightning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also staring at the lightning ocean and slowly nodded his head. He did not immediately move, but had directed his gaze at the Demonic Lightning Abyss that was filled with Demonic Earth Lightning as a smear of pondering flashed in his eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?” Nine Nether was a little stunned, before she continued, “Although you and I have nothing to fear in the Demonic Lightning Abyss that is filled with Demonic Earth Lightning, it might be a little dangerous for the Nine Nether Troop.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I already intend to pass down the Lightning God’s Physique to them.” Mu Chen said slowly, “This Demonic Lightning Abyss is the perfect place to cultivate the Lightning God’s Physique. If the Nine Nether Troop can successfully cultivate the Lightning God’s Physique, the Battle Will formed by them will not be something that the present can be compared to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lightning God’s Physique had great benefits to refining the physique, but along with the rise of Mu Chen’s strength now, the fighting strength that he could gain from the Lightning God’s Physique was getting weaker. If the Nine Nether Troop could successfully cultivate in it, it would definitely be a significant rise in their strength. At that time, Mu Chen had the confidence to defeat all other troops in the Great Havenlaw Domain, except for the mysterious Great Havenlaw Troop, with an amount of just a thousand from the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he was looking at the long term. If the day comes when he was to head for the Luo God Clan, he definitely couldn’t be going single-handedly. He also needed a force that belonged to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the Nine Nether Troop was a pretty good choice. Although they still couldn’t achieve that feat right now, they had the potential.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether briefly pondered and nodded her head as well. She also vaguely knew what Mu Chen was thinking in his heart. Speaking from a certain degree, the Nine Nether Troop was considered as her personal troops, but she had no objections to this. After all, the relationship between the two of them wasn’t something that could be interfered with this alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the decision was made, Mu Chen no longer lagged around. He flew out of the Demonic Lightning Abyss first and gathered the Nine Nether Troop, before bringing them in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Nine Nether Troop’s strength, they naturally couldn’t go down as far as Nine Nether and Mu Chen. They only reached three thousand feet down and they couldn’t advance any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, Mu Chen ordered them to stop and waved his sleeve. A jade bamboo flew out of his sleeve and landed in the hand of one of the Nine Nether Troop’s warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Lightning God’s Physique that I have cultivated. From today onwards, you guys will be training here.”</span></p>

After a brief moment, deep gratitude surged in their eyes. They were well-aware about how valuable this Lightning God’s Physique was. It’s definitely hard to obtain such a Body Refining Divine Art in other forces, and right now, Mu Chen was giving it to them so easily…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Many thanks to the Commander!”</span></p>

He tightly clenched the jade bamboo and everyone there knelt down on a single knee. Their gazes were filled with revere and support. They did not give unnecessary flattery but their voices were filled with gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soldier would die for those who acknowledged their worth. With such a Commander, they could serve with all their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slightly nodded his head and did not say anything unnecessary as well. He waved his hand, then dived into the Demonic Lightning Abyss under the numerous revered gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already achieved what he wanted. Using the Lightning God’s Physique to buy the hearts of the Nine Nether Troop, it was a worthwhile transaction for him.</span></p>
