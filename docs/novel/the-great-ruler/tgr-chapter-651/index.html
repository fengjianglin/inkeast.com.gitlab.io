In this continent, there were many auction houses with decent fame. Although this continent wasn’t vast in size, the reputation of it was resounding in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The origin of the fame came from the countless treasures gathered here. Many of the treasures were gathered here from all sort of places, and circulating through all sort of major auctions. Thus, there was a saying in the Merchant Continent. As long as you possess sufficient Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, you will be able to buy anything you want.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That saying was overbearing, but it showed the foundation of the Merchant Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This continent wasn’t vast in size, but it was extremely complicated. There was an endless amount of forces of various sizes. Besides, the majority of the auctions here had quite the background behind them. So, although there were many treasures gathered here, not many would dare to be reckless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumour had it that a few hundred years ago, there was a huge figure from a dominant force that had his eyes on a treasure. However, he failed to obtain it in the auction in the end and tried to snatch it from the auction. He managed to seize it from the auction manager and his auction opponent by having them killed before freely leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This incident shook the entire Merchant Continent back then, and shortly after, they made a response. In just a few dozen days, the force behind that huge figure experienced being surrounded by all sorts of powerful forces. That figure’s force was gravely injured, and even that huge figure was heavily wounded. In the end, he had no other choice but to hand over that treasure in a miserable state and paid a considerable price as repayment before he could calm the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that incident, no one dared to ignore the rules of the Merchant Continent anymore; do not kill others in the auction to seize treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of the perfected rules of the Merchant Continent, that was the reason why the fame of it could grow more radiant in the Great Thousand World over the past few years. Innumerable people that sought treasures came here to search for the treasures of their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Mu Chen had obtained news of the Void Great Solar Fruit and the Undying Divine Leaf here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">… l</span></p>

Based on the size, it should be the most majestic city in the Merchant Continent, it was also located at the centre of this continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen appeared outside the Merchant City, the shock could not be covered on his face when he saw the majestic city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The city walls were a few hundred feet tall, and the pitch-black city walls’ surface was flickering with chilling lustre. The city walls extended to the point that even at the end of one’s sight, there weren’t any traces of the walls’ edge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Colossal flickering runes could be seen on the city walls as they fluctuated with dreadful Spiritual Energy ripples that made the hearts of others race. Above the city was a massive light pillar that soared into the sky, forming a shield of light that shone down, enveloping the entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only way to enter the city was through the city walls, any method of descending from the sky would activate the massive array in the city, and they would be considered as an intruder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a fearsome array.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the sizable array in the sky of the city with a heavy gaze. The array was myriads of feet in size, flickering with many light patterns that vaguely formed into a complicated Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumor has it that it is a Spiritual Array that was laid down by a Spiritual Array Ancestor, even Earth Sovereigns would have a hard time breaking it in a short time.” Nine Nether smiled as she stood beside Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spiritual Array Ancestor.” Mu Chen inwardly smacked his lips. It was a great existence comparable to Earth Sovereigns. The Merchant City truly was formidable. They could actually hire such a formidable figure to lay a protective Spiritual Array for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go into the city. The two items that you seek should be auctioned today. But I’m not certain if we could get our hands on them.” Nine Nether let out a helpless smile. The Void Great Solar Fruit and Undying Divine Leaf treasures were of extreme rarity, they would definitely cost a huge price to obtain them from auctions like these. Also, it might not be of certain success to get them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that came to seek treasures in the Merchant Continent would all have extraordinary backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head as he rubbed the Mustard Seed Bracelet on his wrist and sighed. Luckily, he got Nine Nether to slightly remove the seal on the Spiritual Condensing Bowl and managed to obtain a portion of the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid in it. Generally speaking, it was a considerable sum, but even so, he wasn’t too confident in obtaining the two treasures that he needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, no matter what, since he managed to get the news of those two, it wasn’t possible for him to let go of them so smoothly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen clenched his teeth. He even managed to obtain the cultivation technique of the Great Solar Undying Body. So he refused to believe that he would be stopped from obtaining the materials required for it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether patted Mu Chen’s shoulder as she strode her long legs into the city. She attracted a considerable amount of gazes along the way. Her figure was tall and slim, she also possessed extreme beauty. Also, her slender eyes that would be even more alluring when she narrowed them possessed an untamable wildness. And, sometimes for men, that wildness would bring great pleasure upon taming it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing those heated gazes, Nine Nether slightly knitted her brows and, shortly after, she extended her hand to grab onto Mu Chen’s arm as she walked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ample soft sensation coming from his arm made Mu Chen slightly stunned. He soon sensed the ill gazes coming from the surroundings directed at him as he helplessly curled his lips. He had been used again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that can be considered as welfare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with envious fortune, Mu Chen and Nine Nether walked into the extremely majestic city. Upon entering the city, Nine Nether immediately let go of Mu Chen’s arm, not giving him the slightest chance to take advantage of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heartless.” Mu Chen spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Nine Nether’s face was filled with smiles as she moved closer to Mu Chen and teased, “You want to take advantage of this Big Sister so much? Sure, when your strength surpasses mine, I’ll even let you carry me to the bedroom. But when requesting such a condition, you must be sure that your little body can take it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rolled his eyes as this ‘Big Sister’ was too open-minded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He, who was defeated, started to sweep his gaze over this majestic city. The population of this city reached a dreadful degree, even a wide street was filled with people walking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sides of the street were filled with all sorts of stores and vast Spiritual Energies that seeped from those places. Evidently, this showed that those items were definitely not simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene made Mu Chen sigh. Those were just ordinary stores, and it was already so extraordinary, how high quality would those genuine auctions be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll head directly for the auction house.” Mu Chen looked at Nine Nether. He was already in a hurry to see the two treasures that he had been yearning for day and night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether did not refute his suggestion and nodded her head. Under the massive flow of people, the two of them paced towards the centre of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stores that they passed by were filled with lustrous glows, making Mu Chen continuously turn his head from the boundless Spiritual Energies that were being emitted. Some treasures even made his heart move. If it wasn’t for saving his strength for the two treasures, he might not be able to endure from buying them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took a full half an hour for them to walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distant location, a grand auction house could already be seen. It stood towering in the centre of the city. It was the biggest auction house in Merchant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the outline of the auction house from far away, Mu Chen’s heart blazed as he quickened his steps. He suddenly heard a commotion coming from the side and slightly shifted his head over. Looking from the situation, a fatty who seemed like the owner of the store roared with his face flushed red, “To mess around in the Merchant City, are you tired of living?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the fatty stood a white-clothed youth that was holding onto a fan. His complexion was fair, and he looked gorgeous as he spoke in a soft tone, “What are you shouting for? Wasn’t it just a hundred-year-old spiritual fruit that I have eaten…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he spoke, his voice was exceptionally crisp and sweet, which made Mu Chen stunned as he gave another glance at the youth. He discovered a disguised façade. That slender figure he possessed<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;and his exquisite face looked a little beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pay up then! That hundred-year-old spiritual fruit cost two hundred Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, pay for it then!” The fatty’s face was ashen-grey as he roared. Earlier, when he saw the young man, he found the temperament of that young man being extraordinary, and he thought that the young man was a young master of a sect. But he never knew that upon taking out the hundred-year-old spiritual fruit, that young man would eat it directly after taking a look at it!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, those in the surroundings couldn’t help having the corners of their mouths twitch. That boss was rather unfortunate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help smiling as he found that lady quite interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t hand over the Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, don’t dream on leaving. I think you must be tired of living to act so wildly in Merchant City!” The fat owner roared with anger as he waved his hand. Following his gesture, guards aggressively charged forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the situation, the white-clothed girl had her brows furrowed as she said, “You dare! Do you believe that I won't get my father to tear this rubbish place apart?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The owner laughed from extreme anger. This little con girl must not know the immensity of the heavens and earth to actually speak such words in Merchant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when he was about to act, Mu Chen who had been standing amongst the crowd for a long time threw out a jade bottle as he spoke, “Here are 200&nbsp;Sovereign Spiritual Liquids.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The owner was stunned as he took the jade bottle. After inspecting it, his face was replaced by a friendly smile before glaring at the white-clothed girl, “Consider yourself lucky!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard!” The white-clothed lady stomped her feet in anger as she gritted her teeth. She hadn’t suffered such grievances in her entire lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen cast a glance at her. He did not have the thoughts to go up and speak as he turned around with Nine Nether and left. The reason why he would help was that his heart had softened. After all, this girl might not know how troublesome it was to be involved with troubles here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey!”</span></p>

The white-clothed girl hastily chased after them, her face was slightly red as she said, “You… thanks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shook his head as he smiled, “You’re quite gusty to actually dare to eat and drink without paying in the Merchant City.”</span></p>

Earlier, I was just too careless… that hundred years spiritual fruit… the aroma of it was too heavenly, and I couldn’t help myself from taking a bite…” The girl spoke in anger, but as her words reached the end, she was a little guilty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, you helped me once. I don’t owe anyone favors, what’s your name? I will definitely return you the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid.” The white-clothed girl looked at Mu Chen as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was about to reject her, but when he saw her sincere gaze, he smiled, “Mu Chen.”</span></p>
