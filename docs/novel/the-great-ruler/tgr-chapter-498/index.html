As the shock waves surged and rumbled, loud claps of thunder could seemingly be heard resounding across the region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the frightening Spiritual Energy shock waves shot out, ripples from it started to affect the battlefield below, causing Xu Huang and the other two to miserably retreat back, their eyes brimming with shock as they looked towards the confrontation happening in the skies. They had never seen such a confrontation before, not even from the fights Mu Chen had with experts of Spiritual Energy Disaster. Indeed, this Wen Qingxuan wasn’t simple at all, being actually able to force Mu Chen to such a degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>

Cracks extended from them like spiderwebs, revealing the astonishing destructive power caused by the collision of their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavily stomping his feet, a shiver shook through Mu Chen’s body as he finally got rid of the frightening force of rebound acting upon him. At this moment, his expression became exceedingly solemn, while the Great Meru Demonic Pillar surfaced behind his body, radiating with astonishing ominous energies. Raising his head, he focused his gaze towards the slender and elegant figure in the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the golden war spear was still present in Wen Qingxuan’s hands, while the golden battle armor encased her slender and exquisite figure. After experiencing the tyrannical head-on collision of their attacks, she appeared to have not received any injury from it. On the contrary, scorching-hot fighting intent gushed from her pair of beautiful eyes. Mu Chen’s power and strength had clearly exceeded what she had expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the opposite party had the assistance of that black-coloured demonic pillar, this was the first time she had seen someone being able to contend against her with a cultivation only at the realm of Human Body Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Blood Calamity of the Spiritual Road is a well-deserved title for you,” said Wen Qingxuan with a smile as she tilted her golden war spear forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The wielder of the Spiritual Road’s Spiritual Crown is truly formidable,” replied Mu Chen with a faint smile. The black lightning light radiating from his body showed not even the slightest sign of turning weaker. The girl before his eyes, Wen Qingxuan, absolutely possessed the qualifications to make him treat her with caution. Regardless of any connections, just based on talent and strength, there were only two people he had met in the last few years that was able to make him feel especially dreadful and cautious when around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of them was Ji Xuan, while the other one was Luo Li. Now, he had to add Wen Qingxuan to this list.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Great Meru Demonic Pillar hovered behind Mu Chen, scarlet-red runes sparkled on the surface of its gigantic body. Boundless ominous energies continued to radiate from it, before pouring into Mu Chen’s body yet again, providing him massive levels of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Between you and Ji Xuan, I wonder which of you is more formidable.” Suddenly, Wen Qingxuan gave a laugh as her jade-like hands tightly clenched her golden war spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Won’t you know it after you’ve tried?” replied Mu Chen in an indifferent tone as his gaze slightly drooped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the faint and minute fluctuations surfacing within Mu Chen’s tone, a crafty smile curled up at the corner of Wen Qingxuan’s small red mouth. From the looks of it, there truly were some deep grudges and grievances between Mu Chen and Ji Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I, Qingxuan, will accept your invitation!” Fighting intent surged within Wen Qingxuan’s beautiful eyes as she gave her reply. Mu Chen’s strength had truly ignited the competitive spirit present in her heart. She had never once assumed that she was weaker than any man. Furthermore, the opposite possessing strength exceeding her own was something that was extremely disliked by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavenly Phoenix Spear!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boundless golden light erupted once again from Wen Qingxuan. With a clench of her jade-like hands, the golden war spear ferociously left her hands. Violently expanding in size, it grew to a gigantic size of a hundred metres in length. As golden light gushed from it, it transformed into a spectacular beam of golden light, shooting at lightning speed towards Mu Chen in an overbearing and incomparably fierce manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing this, not daring to neglect the incoming attack, Mu Chen gave a hug towards the air before him. Causing the Great Meru Demonic Pillar behind him to rush towards the sky. Immediately, ominous energies hid the sky and covered the earth as they swept out, preparing to face the incoming attack once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scree!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as Mu Chen was about to take action once more, a clear and resonant sword cry resounded across the region. A flash swept by Mu Chen’s gaze as a hundred metre shadow longsword split the air apart as it suddenly shot by, instantaneously appearing in front of the golden war spear, before smashing right into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A clear metallic sound resounded as Sword Aura and Spear Aura swept out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A slender and soul-stirring figure appeared right on top of the shadow sword. With a raise of her jade-like hand, currents of Sword Aura gushed from within, heavily smashing against the golden war spear. The might of the surging force immediately sent the golden war spear flying back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, Wen Qingxuan raised her eyebrows, and moved her hand, which caused the golden war spear to rapidly shrink in size, before it returned to her hands as a golden beam of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Captain Wen Qingxuan, if you really want to take action, let me accompany you.” Standing tall on the gigantic shadow sword, a frosty expression covered the entirety of her exquisite, porcelain-like face as she spoke out. Staring right at Wen Qingxuan, she spread her jade-like hands apart, and slowly raised her Luo God Sword. In the next instant, astonishingly fierce Sword Intent started to radiate from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li, it’s he who asked me to test it out. Didn’t you hear what he said just now?” Seeing that Luo Li was about to take action, a sweet smile appeared on Wen Qingxuan’s face as she said in helplessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite her reply, she gradually started to restrain her boundless Spiritual Energy, while the fighting intent within her beautiful eyes started to slowly withdraw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, Luo Li clenched her hand, causing the Luo God Sword to shoot back into her hand. Looking at Wen Qingxuan with a somewhat helpless expression, she replied, “Captain Wen Qingxuan, we don’t have any intention of being hostile towards you and your group. Therefore, please do not cause anymore trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Giving a lovable smile, Wen Qingxuan nodded her head, before shooting towards Luo Li and saying, “However, I don’t like the way you address me. I’ve been searching for you for so long already. Therefore, you have to call me Qingxuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the amicable smile brimming on Wen Qingxuan’s face, Luo Li slightly hesitated. Nevertheless, she nodded her head once as she replied, “Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Wen Qingxuan had restrained her fighting intent, Mu Chen had also shot towards Luo Li. Hearing the exceedingly intimate tone Wen Qingxuan was using in her speech towards Luo Li, Mu Chen slightly raised his eyebrows as he thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was a male… I would have immediately hugged the Great Meru Demonic Pillar and sent it smashing down…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Captain Mu Chen, I’ve merely wanted to test your strength. You wouldn’t mind my earlier actions, right?” A generous and alluring smile appeared on Wen Qingxuan’s face as she said while looking towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the stunningly beautiful face of Wen Qingxuan that caused people to lose their breaths, Mu Chen felt a slight ache developing in his head. The girl before him was truly too troublesome to deal with. Such a character on a beauty like her was already excessive, yet she was too hard to be dealt with…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below them, Xu Huang and the other two had move closer, their faces and hair all covered in dirt and grime. Earlier, despite their collaboration, they were suppressed to a distressed state by the two identical flower-like beauties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey. You three are no good. Compared to your Captain, you three are trailing behind by too much.” The four members of Wen Qingxuan had also shot over. Resting her giant axe on her soft and alluring shoulder, the golden-haired girl looked towards Xu Huang and the other two before flinging her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking up toward those seemingly gentle and weak girls, with smiles pursing on their lips and little dimples on their lovable faces, Xu Huang and the other two could not help feeling somewhat embarrassed. However, the trio knew how formidable those gentle and quiet young girls were, since they were tossed quite vigorously here and there by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Depressed expressions covered the faces of the trio. They had assumed that they were able to raise eyebrows and cause people to hold their breaths towards them after breaking through their Human Body Disaster. However, they never expected that they wouldn’t be able to deal with two soft and tender girls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re the group ranked at the first place. Their strength as a whole is naturally higher than us,” said Mu Chen with a smile as he patted on the shoulders of the trio.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing Xu Huang and the other two could do was give a bitter smile while nodding their heads. That’s why Wen Qingxuan and her group were able to occupy and dominate the first place. With such strength and lineup, they truly were extremely strong and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Turning his head to look at Wen Qingxuan, wrinkles appeared on Mu Chen’s forehead as he asked, “Captain Wen Qingxuan, exactly what reason have you come to find us for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a flink of her finger, her golden war spear disappeared in a flash. Blinking her big eyes towards Mu Chen, Wen Qingxuan replied, “Two reasons. The first is to come and see Luo Li, as she had greatly helped me in the Spiritual Road, while I’ve not had the chance to thank her for that. As for the second reason… I’ve wanted to find you to collaborate. Naturally, I needed to test your strength before collaborating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Collaborate?” asked Mu Chen doubtfully as he looked towards Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Divine Wood Palace Quota.” Curling a lock of her black hair behind her ear, Wen Qingxuan gave her reply in a played down manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you all have also come here for the Divine Quota, huh,” said Mu Chen with a slight frown on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re too narrow-minded. In the Ancient Antiquity, the Divine Wood Palace was one of the regional Overlords of this Shattered Continent. The inheritance present in their remnant isn’t something that you can devour all by yourself.” Wen Qingxuan rolled her eyes towards Mu Chen, saying, “Furthermore, you guys aren’t the only ones that have obtain the Divine Quota. From what I know, there’s a total of six Divine Quotas. You guys have merely obtain one of them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The groups that came earlier to deal with you guys are from the Academy Alliance. You should have heard about them, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes,” replied Mu Chen as he nodded his head. Feeling doubtful, he asked, “What’s the matter with that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Simply speaking, they’re an alliance,” replied Wen Qingxuan with a smile. “They’re an alliance formed by the groups of numerous spiritual academies. Although the groups from those spiritual academies are naturally not our match in a 1-on-1 duel, after the reorganization in their alliance, their strength has become exceedingly tyrannical.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reorganization?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes… for example, they would split their groups up before gathering all of their experts together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen asked in shock, “Is that possible? Won’t that break the rules?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing that doesn’t conform to the rules. It's just that those reorganized groups aren’t able to enter the final match, that’s all. Naturally, at that time, all they need to do is to form their original groups once again. &nbsp;However, at that time, after obtaining the various benefits from the Shattered Continent, their strength would be much greater than before,” replied Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Therefore, although you guys aren’t quite bad, you can’t rely on the strength of your group alone to contend against an entire alliance, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her reply, thick creases appeared on Mu Chen’s forehead. He never imagined that situation of the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament would have such changes during their mere isolation of 20-plus days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s said that the Academy Alliance has also obtained a Divine Quota. Therefore, at that time, when you enter the Divine Wood Palace, you would definitely bump into them. I believe that if we collaborate, it would be extremely beneficial to you guys,” said Wen Qingxuan with a clench of her hand, her face brimming with confidence. In the next instant, she cast her pair of bright and beautiful eyes towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, what do you say?”</span></p>
