 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Large stones constantly fell, leaving the ground below filled with holes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two silhouettes stood on the horizon as they confronted one another. Behind the two of them, there were two massive oceans of Battle Will that were emanating powerful oppressions that any Sixth Grade Sovereign would be fearful of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other forces all had grave expressions as they looked at the confrontation in the horizon. Such a confrontation between Battle Formation Masters was extremely rare in the Northern Region. After all, there was too little Battle Formation Masters in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there were Battle Formation Masters in the Northern Region in the past, they had all left in the end, heading to realms that were larger than the Northern Region. That’s because, in those realms, they could obtain better resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Northern Region was extremely large in the views of many, it was just a small portion of the Greatlaw Continent, one of the ten major continents in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow actually became a Battle Formation Master!” In the direction of the Divine Pavilion, Fang Yi’s expression was dark as he looked at the surging Battle Will behind Mu Chen. Back then, when he met Mu Chen in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, the latter wasn’t even qualified by him to be viewed with great importance. Even at the very end, it was only because Mu Chen had the help of the daughter of the Flame Emperor, thus he was able to become the biggest benefitter in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he never expected that when they had met again, the person that he could belittle in the past could already confront him, and now that Mu Chen became a Battle Formation Master, Mu Chen could leave him in the dust with the power of Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli looked at this scene with a calm expression. Although Mu Chen did not obtain the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor, he obtained the inheritance of the Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor, which was even more formidable. Even if the inheritance wasn’t complete, the defection of it being incomplete wouldn’t appear in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That Mu Chen is indeed a talented young man. Looks like the battle between the two of them will be a ferocious battle between giants. But this is also good. One of the two will definitely be injured in this battle, which is pretty good news to our Divine Pavilion.” The Sky Dragon Lord was faintly watching this scene. He was naturally more than willing to see the confrontation between the Great Havenlaw Domain and the Netherworld Palace. Although they had grudges with the Great Havenlaw Domain, they weren’t that harmonious with the Netherworld Palace either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let us see who will remain laughing till the end in this battle between Battle Formation Masters.”</span></p>

I wonder how much improvement there will be to my will after devouring the will of a Battle Formation Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he stomped on the air, which caused space to undulate. Behind him, a boundless ocean of Battle Will roared and everyone could sense a powerful oppression swiftly spreading out from the surging ocean of Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tidal waves seemed to be rolling on the ocean of Battle Will. At the centre of it, a vortex was formed; and in it, a massive black skull could be seen slowly rising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black skull was filled with densely-packed runes. Its pitch-black pupils flickered. Looking from afar, it was like a demon that came from hell, emitting fluctuations that made others feel fearful.</span></p>

They must have sensed the threat that was being given off by this black skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s Lin Ming’s Spirit of Battle Will?” Some experts wore a grave expression, since they could naturally feel that the Battle Will Spirit formed my Lin Ming was several times stronger than the Battle Will Spirits of their troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the power of a Battle Formation Master. In their hands, a violent Battle Will could display such a terrifying power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Death War Beam!”</span></p>

The black skull head opened its mouth and a pitch-black beam of light that was roughly a hundred feet shot out. In the path of the beam, space had immediately shattered. It was silent, yet it was filled with terrifying destructive power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Battle Will Spirit was formed, the might of it had increased more than a fold. The light beam looked simple, but the power was even more ferocious than the blade from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beam of light swiftly expanded by Mu Chen’s eyes and he suddenly put his hands together.</span></p>

As black beams of light swept out, it had devoured Mu Chen’s silhouette.</span></p>

Was Mu Chen struck by Lin Ming’s attack that was like a bolt of lightning?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming squinted his eyes as he looked in the location that the black light was spreading out. In the next instant, he had suddenly narrowed his eyes. As a powerful gale swept past, the black lights immediately dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the black beam of light, Mu Chen calmly stood with a huge palm of Battle Will, which was covered in runes, acting as a shield before him.</span></p>

The number of runes on it seems pretty shocking.” Many experts watched this scene and felt slightly startled in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s black pupils fixed onto to far away Lin Ming with a flash of cold light in his eyes. The huge Battle Will Spirit palm, which was roughly a thousand feet, burst forth and appeared above Lin Ming, before it ruthlessly and heavily slammed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a simple palm without any fancy tricks. A myriad of runes flickered on the huge palm as the terrifying Battle Will swept out. It was like a colossal mountain that descended from the sky and the might of it could even shatter space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such an attack was something that even a Sixth Grade Sovereign would have to deal with at full force.</span></p>

The black skull at his rear opened its vicious mouth, before emitting a sharp ear-piercing shriek.</span></p>

Countless beams of Battle Will shot up from the ocean of Battle Will at his rear, before they whizzed through the horizon and enveloped Lin Ming and the troop behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an extremely majestic attack.</span></p>

From the ocean of Battle Will that was behind him, waves of Battle Will swiftly swept up before turning into layers of waves that were myriads of feet that rolled through space and clashed with the beams of Battle Will that enveloped from every direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>

In that point of collision, a crack, which was ten thousand feet long, was split open.</span></p>

Even a pinnacle Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm expert would have a hard time reaching this level, which made some experts exclaim. In terms of cultivation, Mu Chen was only a Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm, while Lin Ming was a Fourth Grade Sovereign Realm. If it was an ordinary time, it would be impossible for them to confront Sixth Grade Sovereigns. But right now, with the aid of Battle Will, even a Sixth Grade Sovereign would be fearful of them.</span></p>

But he wasn’t familiar with the profound energies of Battle Will. Therefore, it was impossible for him to see which of them, between Mu Chen or Lin Ming could gain the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli briefly pondered, before speaking out, “Based on the amount of Battle Will, the Battle Will Spirit formed by Lin Ming has a total of 11,000 runes, while Mu Chen only has 10,500 runes. The difference between them is extremely small, so if it’s purely based on the battle between Battle Wills, it is hard for a winner to be determined. But the two of them aren’t simple figures, so they naturally have means still hidden in their sleeves. So it’ll depend on their hidden means to determine who will be the winner.”</span></p>

Clearly, the two of them had realised that it was impossible for them to achieve victory with an attack of this degree.</span></p>
