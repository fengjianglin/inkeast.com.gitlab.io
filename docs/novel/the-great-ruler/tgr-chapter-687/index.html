Above the ocean of trees, there were vaguely seven figures standing there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those seven figures were a thousand feet apart with tremendous Spiritual Energy fluctuations sweeping out from them, causing violent gales to blow. They were exchanging gazes with their eyes filled with alarm and fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They knew that if they wanted to ascend the Greatlaw Goldstage, then the other party would be their biggest obstruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seven of them were the best amongst the various forces of the Great Havenlaw Domain, any one of them wouldn’t be any weaker than to the four individual heads of Mt Mang. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to take the lead in the first batch. This was also precisely the reason that a ferocious battle would take place when they meet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone that wanted to ascend the Greatlaw Goldstage would definitely draw the enmity and attacks of those seven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, when Mu Chen showed up, the seven people had instantly directed their gazes over. Their eyes narrowed in an instant as they recognised Mu Chen. After all, the commotion of the fight between the latter and four heads of Mt Mang wasn’t small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength displayed by Mu Chen made them feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seven of them knitted their brows, since they never imagined that Mu Chen would be coming towards their direction. Now, they would have an additional fearful enemy. After witnessing the fight from before, they understood that if they were to fight individually, not a single of them would be Mu Chen’s opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes of those seven flickered as they exchanged a gaze with each other. Their gazes flickered as they agreed on the same decision. Although Mu Chen was powerful, if he wanted to pass through them, then they would have to join hands and intimidate him a little to let him understand that even if he had a formidable strength, he still had to follow the rules in this sort of place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the gazes that were directed over, Mu Chen maintained a calm expression on his face, since he knew about the decision of those seven. However, he had no intention of retreating and inhaled a deep breath instead, before his eyes gradually turned sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if it was an obstruction of seven Sovereigns? Mu Chen’s path was something even an expert like Luo Tianshen could not stop, not to mention these fellows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The path laid before him was filled with thorns, even if he had to fight while being soaked in blood, he would charge through it without any fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen abruptly stepped forward as the space behind him distorted. His Sovereign Sea vaguely appeared with purple flames that were rising and a visible Spiritual Energy fluctuation that suddenly swept out with him in the centre. The ocean of trees beneath had also entirely caved in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Halt your steps!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing as Mu Chen was not the least bit bothered and was directly charging towards the Greatlaw Goldstage, the seven Sovereigns expert instantly barked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Mu Chen is too arrogant, he’s actually disregarding us?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anger held in the eyes of those seven as they acted out at the same time. Boundless Spiritual Energies swept out that seemed like enraged dragons as they swiftly sent attacks towards Mu Chen at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, the light figure formed by Mu Chen abruptly come to halt as he watched the incoming Spiritual Energies. A chill flowed in his pupils as he stomped his feet. A black stream of light soared from his head into the sky. An indescribable ominous aura had also exploded forth at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within that stream of light, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar flew out and expanded along the wind into a few hundred feet in size, it was like a pillar that could support the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen hugged the space before him and heavily swung the Great Meru Demonic Pillar down. Instantly, the space before him cracked as the torrential ominous aura caused the heavens and earth to turn dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Also, there wasn’t any decrease in the momentum as it made its way towards three Sovereign experts up ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Meru Demonic Pillar brought along shadow and torrential ominous aura, causing the ocean of trees below to be instantly torn apart. Those three Sovereigns that were shrouded in the attack had their faces changed. They clearly sensed how fearsome Mu Chen’s offence was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Gales swept up in an instant as the ocean of trees within a few thousand feet in radius was instantly levelled to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Sovereign Celestial Bodies shot out as they retreated, shaking the earth as they flew away, leaving behind deep craters at the same time. When they stabilised their figures, there was a smear of horror in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, they understood the fear that the four heads of Mt Mang had at the last moment. When this youth before them truly attacked, he would definitely aim for the kill and would not show any leniency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They raised their heads, looking at Mu Chen, who was standing on the horizon. The Great Meru Demonic Pillar stood behind him, spreading an ominous aura. That ominous aura was similar to that of a primordial demonic god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black pupils of the slim youth looked like there was a fire blazing with them. There weren’t any fluctuations of emotions on his face, but his gaze made them feel a jolt in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a firm gaze that seemed like it could not be shaken by anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To walk down his path, the youth that stood before them looked like he could fork out his life as a price. And no matter who was obstructing him, they would all be reduced to ashes beneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they were startled in their hearts, Mu Chen’s figure moved and appeared directly above the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. The Great Meru Demonic Pillar turned into a dark ray of light and flew out. His speed was exceptionally swift, but if the seven Sovereigns intended to stop him, they could easily achieve that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this time, no one dared to act out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because they felt fearful animosity from Mu Chen. The latter’s firm gaze made them understand that if they were to act out, then this youth before them might unleash a deathmatch with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To achieve what they had, they had to fork out endless hard work. Thus, they cherished their lives very much. Even if the qualification of the Greatlaw Goldpond was precious, it was incomparable to their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, even if they managed to ascend the Greatlaw Goldstage, they still had to face the powerful Four Great Domain Lords. Thus, there was no gain for them to fight such a ferocious and firm person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes of those seven people flickered with hesitation and struggles could be seen in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen still paid no attention to them as he stood on the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. A violent wind brush against him, fluttering his clothes. In the eyes of the youth, flames seemed to be surging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath the Goldpond Peak, countless people held their breaths as they watched this scene. They were clearly impacted by Mu Chen’s actions of charging through the confinement of the seven Sovereigns all by himself.</span></p>

However, when they were extremely nervous, they felt that they could not shift their gazes away from the current Mu Chen.</span></p>

In the end, he brushed past the seven Sovereigns’ faces.</span></p>

The gaze of that youth made them understand that if they were to attack, even if they could obstruct Mu Chen today, they would have to pay a terrible price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They couldn’t imagine how a youth could have such a firm and sharp gaze. But their years of cultivation made them understand that such a figure wasn’t good to provoke.</span></p>

In the future, that youth would definitely have an extraordinary achievement, so how could Mu Chen’s steps be obstructed by them?</span></p>

Clearly, they felt that it was hard to believe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they weren’t there, so they couldn’t understand the actions of those seven Sovereigns.</span></p>

They looked at the youth who was standing on the Great Meru Demonic Pillar as their gazes slightly flickered.</span></p>

Finally, a decent person has appeared in our Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>

His pupils were as abstruse as the starry sky with intelligence. He looked at that slender figure as he said in a hoarse voice.</span></p>

After all, this was the first time after all these years that they heard Sleeping Emperor praising a younger generation in this way. Even the Four Great Domain Lords had not gotten such treatment yet.</span></p>

But, in the end, there’s too little that can emerge.”</span></p>

Shortly after, he tapped his feet in the air, and his figure flew out. In more than ten breaths, the gold and radiant Greatlaw Goldstage had already appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He strode forth and placed his feet on it. It was a firm sensation that lifted an arc on the corner of his lips. He was finally on this Greatlaw Goldstage.</span></p>
