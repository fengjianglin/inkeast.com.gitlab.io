 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, may I ask the origin of this Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique?” Mu Chen asked from curiosity. Judging from the reaction of the Sky Formation Emperor, this visualisation technique seemed to have a history behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique was left behind in the ancient times by the Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor.” The Sky Formation Emperor smiled. Although his voice was still somewhat calm, Mu Chen could sense the abnormal undulations when he spoke of the Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor, which seemed to be a form of revere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor?”</span></p>

That’s because he had no knowledge of this senior, but he should also be a Battle Formation Master, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor was a Battle Formation Master that could reach the level of ten million runes in the ancient times.” The Sky Formation Emperor slowly said. But when he spoke of the ‘ten million runes’, his eyes were filled with yearning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten million runes?”</span></p>

That’s because he realised that he was completely unfamiliar with the terms of Battle Formation Masters. What did ten million runes mean?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you’re a pup that’s not even in the foothold of Battle Formation Masters.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen briefly hesitated as he probed, “It’s the amount of runes, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no knowledge about Battle Formation Masters. After all, he only relied on his senses to form the Spirit of Battle Will of the five troops. But it seemed that the more runes there were on the Battle Will Spirit, the more powerful it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Formation Emperor nodded his head, “Amongst the Battle Formation Masters in the ancient times, the number of runes were categorised. Generally, categorisation was in four levels. Ten Thousand Runes Battle Formation Master, Hundred Thousand Runes Battle Formation Master, Million Runes Battle Formation Master and Ten Million Runes Battle Formation Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the strange classification, the corner of Mu Chen’s lips twitched. These Battle Formation Masters were truly lazy to even have such a crude classification for their levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But despite being crude, it was extremely direct to the point that Mu Chen had to admit that it was extremely clear just from the name itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But the number of runes here does not imply the total runes on the Spirits of Battle Will, but the runes refined after combining all the Battle Wills.” The Sky Formation Emperor explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned, before there was a flash in his mind and he understood what he meant. When he had commanded the five troops earlier, there were a few thousand runes on each of the Spirits of Battle Will. If they were added all together, he would have reached ten thousand. But that didn’t mean that he had reached the level of a Ten Thousand Runes Battle Formation Master. That’s because, unless he could combine the Battle Wills of the five troops together and form a new Spirit of Battle Will, and it possesses over ten thousand runes, only then could he be considered as a genuine Ten Thousand Runes Battle Formation Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The further you go, the harder it will be to refine runes.” Zhantai Liuli softly said from the side, “I command the Azure Troop, which numbers thirty thousand, but the amount of runes I can refine is about nine thousand. There’s still a distance to reach ten thousand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, Zhantai Liuli revealed self-confidence on her face as she smiled. “But that is due to me controlling them on purpose. After reaching the lesser success of this Visualization Technique given to me by teacher, it’s easy to reach the level of Ten Thousand Runes Battle Formation Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inwardly smacked his lips. When he commanded the Nine Nether Troop, which was around five thousand, he could refine roughly four thousand runes, whereas Zhantai Liuli could only form nine thousand runes with thirty thousand of the Azure Troop. So one could see how difficult it was to refine runes when the number increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Mu Chen’s estimation, if he could command a powerful troop like the Azure Troop, he could perhaps refine ten thousand runes. The reason he could sense that was probably because he was a Spiritual Array Master, and his will was slightly stronger than Zhantai Liuli’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are two points which relate to refining runes. The quantity and quality of a troop, and the other one is the strength of one’s will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Formation Emperor continued to explain for Mu Chen, who was ignorant in the matters of Battle Formation Masters. “A troop represents the Battle Will, a crucial factor to Battle Formation Masters and Battle Will is the foundation of runes. Furthermore, the strength of will represented if you could control their Battle Wills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded. For a Battle Formation Master, their troop was like a Divine Artifact and will represented the energy of that Divine Artifact. If the will was more powerful, that meant that the Divine Artifact would be able to display a stronger power as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To a Battle Formation Master, ten thousand runes is the dividing line. If you manage to refine a Spirit of Battle Will with ten thousand runes, then there would be a complete change in the power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because, when a Spirit of Battle Will could refine ten thousand runes, that means that it has already reached the lesser success in Battle Will. At that time, the Battle Will will undergo an evolution into Battle Seals.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Battle Will into Battle Seals?” Mu Chen had puzzlement written on his face, since he was quite unfamiliar with this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Battle Seal is a higher level of control towards Battle Will. Just like Divine Arts in the cultivation of Spiritual Energy, being able to unleash the power of Battle Wills to the fullest. Naturally, ten thousand runes represent the bottom line of laying battle formations. Only by reaching that level can one lay out battle formations that can greatly enhance Battle Wills and form into multiple means of attacking.” Zhantai Liuli said from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen exclaimed in surprise, then nodded his head. He never knew that Battle Wills could be used in such a way. Just thinking about it, his previous means of utilising Battle Will were extremely crude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Generally speaking, when a Spirit of Battle Will forms ten thousand runes, it could be comparable to Seventh Grade Sovereign Realm experts. And if it reaches fifty thousand runes, even an Eighth Grade Sovereign Realm expert would fear, whereas a hundred thousand battle runes can confront a Ninth Grade Sovereign.” The Sky Formation Emperor faintly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen squinted his eyes with shock deep within. A Spirit of Battle Will with a hundred thousand runes could actually confront a Ninth Grade Sovereign. Then, how terrifying would a Million Runes Battle Formation Master be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was the Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor a terrifying existence that could confront a Heavenly Sovereign?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A million runes is comparable to Earth Sovereigns… while a Battle Will Spirit of ten million runes is something that even a Heavenly Sovereign would not face head-on. That terrifying power can even annihilate a Lower Plane with a flick of a finger.” The Sky Formation Emperor spoke with a heavy expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Annihilate a Lower Plane…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s heart shook. Back then, when he comprehended the so-called “Heart of Battle Formations”, the scene that he saw seemed to be an endless and massive Nine-Headed Hydra that annihilated a Lower Plane that harboured countless Fiends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, Mu Chen did not pay much attention to it. But now that he thought about it again, that Nine-Headed Hydra seemed to be filled with countless runes, with numbers that probably exceeded ten million.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never expected the Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor to have such a great origin.” Mu Chen gasped in admiration. That sort of existence was definitely a pinnacle existence between the heavens and earth, he could be considered as a huge pillar in the Great Thousand World. It Looked like he had lost an opportunity to be given with another instead. Although he did not manage to obtain the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor, he had obtained something left behind by a terrifying existence.</span></p>

The Nine Lightning Tribulations Visualisation Technique isn’t complete, it’s only a four tribulations cultivating method. The other five have been long lost. But even so, if you’re able to cultivate all four of the tribulations, it’s not hard for you to refine a few hundred thousand runes. It is so much so that with that compatibility of yours, you might even be able to come in contact with a million runes.” The Sky Formation Emperor said.</span></p>

If opportunity allowed in the future, he could try and gather the remaining five tribulations cultivation technique. Since, according to his estimations, it was absolutely impossible for him to complete the four initial tribulations in a short period of time.</span></p>

Although he did not obtain his inheritance, the Sky Formation Emperor still opened the door of Battle Formation Masters to him and even gave him an opportunity with great potential. Thus, he felt grateful in his heart.</span></p>

So it’s natural for me to give you an opportunity.”</span></p>

Before I dissipate, let me give the both of you a gift.” The Sky Formation Emperor forced a smile towards the two of them and waved his hand, causing the stone troop below to tremble and numerous silhouettes soared into the sky, turning into grey lights, and fell into the Sky Formation Emperor’s hand.</span></p>

If you’re in danger, you can activate it and their Battle Will will aid you to get through your crisis. But do keep in mind that you can only use it once before it turns into ashes.”</span></p>
