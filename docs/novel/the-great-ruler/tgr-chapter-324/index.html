 <p><strong>Chapter 324 - Three Great General</strong></p>
 <p>At the peak of Spiritual Light Mountain, covered with lingering clouds, the three giant peaks, akin to pillars that propped the sky up, pierced through the clouds. As of now, however, a dense and numerous amount of figures had surfaced in the air surrounding them. With a glance, one can almost not find an end to the present crowd.</p>
 <p>All of the students that had participated in the hunt converged there, waiting for the incoming final fight.</p>
 <p>At this moment, gazes were sent towards the summit of the three great peaks, where three figures were quietly sitting. While the mountain winds were blowing at their clothing, their eyes were open, without even the slightest trace of change, due to the gathering of countless students. Even their breathing was calm and tranquil, without the slightest bit of disturbance.</p>
 <p>All of the students were staring at the three figures with thick respect shown within their eyes. The three people in their sights should be the final protectors of this hunt.</p>
 <p>They were the previous top three ranks of the Heavenly Rankings, and were now the three Great Generals of the Punishment Hall.</p>
 <p>In the surroundings of the mountain peak, the clouds fluttered around as the sea of humans pervaded the air. However, what’s strange was that there wasn’t any clamoring and arguing noises present. Everyone was able to feel a faint pressure radiating from the bodies of the three figures on the top of the mountain peak. Enveloping the entire stretch of the world, it caused them to feel as if their heads were being weighed down.</p>
 <p>Within the silence that blotted the sky, three figures slowly walked out, before stopping in the air a thousands metres away from the 3 giant peaks.</p>
 <p>Regardless of the surroundings of Spiritual Light Mountain or the northern public square, everyone’s gazes had converged onto the bodies of those three figures. Within those gazes, there was anticipation, apprehension, doubt…</p>
 <p>However, regardless of that, those three figures, as of now, had undoubtedly become the focus of everyone’s attention.</p>
 <p>At the instant when they walked out, the three figures that were sitting on the giant peaks slowly opened their tightly closed eyes.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Energy of the world seemed to have erupted and explosively swept out at this instant. Intense booming and rumbling sounds could be faintly discernable as they resounded across the world.</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng, you’ve finally arrived.” at the middle giant peak, a male gave a faint smile as his tranquil voice slowly rang out. However, this made the hearts of countless people subsequently throb as a pressure enveloped over them.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I’ve let Senior Brother Lin Zheng wait for a long time.” Coming to a stop in front of the male. Shen Cangsheng cupped his hands and sent his greetings, while his eyes made a faint contraction that was unnoticable.</p>
 <p><em>That’s Lin Zheng of the three Great Generals?</em> Mu Chen thought while sending his gaze over, only to see a male dressed in a black outfit. He had a head full of white hair. Instead of a pale white, it radiated with a silvery shadow, with light circulating through it, making it seem mysterious.</p>
 <p>At this time, he had already acquired some information about the three Great Generals. This Lin Zheng was said to be the person with the highest strength amongst the three Great Generals.</p>
 <p>“Undoubtedly the previous number one on the Heavenly Rankings.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s expression slowly turned dignified, as he was able to sense a strong pressure radiating from within Lin Zheng’s body. That sort of feeling was akin to a mountain range appearing above someone’s head, causing people to be unable to catch their breath.</p>
 <p>This Lin Zheng must have already stepped into the Heavenly Completion Stage. Furthermore, he might not be only at the Heavenly Completion Initial Stage…</p>
 <p>Heavenly Completion Stage, that’s the final step before Sovereign Stage. If Sovereign Stage experts were able to become a Regional Lord in a continent, then Heavenly Completion Stage experts could be considered as Regional Tyrants.</p>
 <p>Since Lin Zheng was able to achieve a strength of Heavenly Completion Stage at such an age, that was sufficient to indicate his possession of astonishing talent…</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing that could be said for the long wait. However, since it’s the final fight, we’ll not throw it.” A voice rang out from the giant peak on the right of Lin Zheng. Looking over, Mu Chen spotted a male dressed in red. His hair was scarlet red, akin to a burning flame. Around him, the air showed faint traces of distortion, as if created by a high temperature.</p>
 <p>“That’s Gu Tianyan, your opponent this time,” muttered Li Xuantong to Mu Chen in a low voice.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing those words, Mu Chen’s eyes instantly contracted as he gravely stared at the red-haired male. The Spiritual Energy of the world around the latter seemed to be exceedingly erratic, as if it was a patch of the burning sea of flames.</p>
 <p>This pressure coming from Gu Tianyan was not as strong as Lin Zheng’s; however, it still caused a dangerous flavor to coarse through Mu Chen’s body. Mu Chen knew that there would not be a single one amongst the three Great Generals that were easy to be dealt with.</p>
 <p>“Gu Tianyan’s strength should be around Heavenly Completion Initial Stage. The divine art he trains in is called the Heavenly Inflammation Divine Art. This makes his Spiritual Energy akin to heavenly flames, which are overbearing and burn with a furious intensity. Any action he makes is enough to burn and incinerate cities and mountains.” Li Xuantong tried his best to give more information to Mu Chen, in an effort to allow him to muster a better response.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head as he thought, <em>Heavenly Completion Initial Stage is exceedingly strong.</em> This was not something that He Yao, with his half-step into the Heavenly Completion Stage, could compare to. If He Yao was allowed to cross hands with Gu Tianyan, Mu Chen could definitely confirm that He Yao would be defeated extremely miserably within five rounds.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Gu Tianyan’s Spiritual Energy was somewhat different from the norm. Mu Chen wondered, <em>Compared to my Spiritual Energy that is fused with the Nine Nether Flames, exactly which one is more overbearing?</em></p>
 <p>Mu Chen stared at Gu Tianyan for a while, before looking at the leftmost giant peak. Right there, similarly, was a sitting man. This person had a head full of black hair, with a rather handsome face. Faintly smiling at the crowd, he did not show any intent to speak.</p>
 <p>Compared to Lin Zheng and Gu Tianyan, this person clearly appeared to not want to attract too much attention. However, Mu Chen knew that if anyone underestimated him, the only thing they could say was that their heads got muddled.</p>
 <p>“Is that Senior Brother Zhou Qing? Who’s also your opponent this time?” Mu Chen looked towards Li Xuantong and asked.</p>
 <p>Li Xuantong turned his gaze towards the black-haired male, faintly nodded his head, then replied, “It’s said that during that year, Senior Brother Zhou Qing had a nickname within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, he was called ‘Undefeatable Mountain’…”</p>
 <p>“Undefeatable Mountain?” Mu Chen muttered in startlement.</p>
 <p>“The meaning is that when he fought with people, he would basically not lose.” Li Xuantong replied with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Then why did the 1st rank in the Heavenly Rankings still belong to Senior Brother Lin Zheng?” Mu Chen asked with some doubt.</p>
 <p>“I never said that he won.” Li Xuantong replied with a smile, as he abstrusely looked at the faintly smiling black-haired male sitting on the giant peak in the distance, before continuing, “A large majority of his fights resulted with no victories and no losses. The main reason was due to his special intentions; however, there were also other reasons.”</p>
 <p>“The divine art he trains in is named the Undefeatable Divine Art. It sounds absolutely overbearing; however, it is an extremely gentle divine art. There isn’t any overly intense attacking moves within it, and the majority is focusing on dealing with people, before finally causing the opponent’s Spiritual Energy to be completely wasted…”</p>
 <p>“Therefore, within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, the large majority of the people he crossed hands with would end with a draw. Therefore, other people have given him the nickname of ‘Undefeatable Mountain’.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the explanation, Mu Chen was astonished. This so-called ‘Undefeatable Divine Art’ was unexpectedly that special and unique. However, it was very clear that, at certain times, not being defeated and not having a victory was, from some sense, already a very frightening achievement.</p>
 <p>Zhou Qingshan, naturally, could not be overly vicious when crossing hands with the people in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, if he were to truly have killing intent, even that gentle divine art might reveal its malevolent side.</p>
 <p>These three Great Generals. None of them were simple…</p>
 <p>While Mu Chen and Li Xuantong were talking in low voices, Shen Cangsheng cupped his hands and sent a smile towards Gu Tianyan, before saying, “A victory gained by the other’s throwing is something that I also cannot stand to see. How should the later fight be fought?”</p>
 <p>“Undeniably, you are the current 1st Rank on the Heavenly Rankings. Your courage isn’t small.” replied Gu Tianyan with a smile, while his scarlet hair appeared to be like burning flames. It could be seen that he treats Shen Cangsheng with extreme regard. The latter’s strength was something that even made him feel dread. This made him unable to help secretly sighing in exclamation. This batch of students in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy this time seemed more formidable than theirs.</p>
 <p>Lin Zheng made a gesture with his hands, before standing up and saying, “We’ve already waited here for so long. Shen Cangsheng, you three should already come up. Only by passing through us will all the students that have participated in the hunt be able to obtain the Spiritual Light Empowerment, if not…”</p>
 <p>Before completing his words, the intent within was something everyone understood. In the next instant, Shen Cangsheng tightly clenched his fist as anticipation and nervousness erupted within his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I invite Senior Brother Lin Zheng to bestow his guidance.”</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng spoke out with a large laugh, with the laughing voice filled with a powerful and free intent that showed his disdain. Clenching his palm, golden light condensed, transforming into a golden-coloured divine spear. The tip of the spear was akin to a folded lotus. Golden light circulated and radiated from it, showing off its boundless Spiritual Energy that was contained within.</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng gripped the golden spear in his hands. With a move of his body, he appeared on the giant peak that Lin Zheng was on. Heavily impaling his golden spear onto the ground, a shock wave swept out, causing the surface of the summit of the mountain peak to be instantly swept clean.</p>
 <p>The moment Shen Cangsheng moved out, he had intercepted the strongest of the three Great Generals, Lin Zheng. This did not exceed the expectations of the crowd. Being the previous 1st Rank of the Heavenly Rankings, only the current 1st Rank of the Heavenly Ranking could contend with him.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Li Xuantong patted Mu Chen’s shoulders. In the next instant, his body moved, and appeared on the giant peak Zhou Qingshan was on. Cupping his hands and sending his greetings, he said, “Senior Brother Zhou Qingshan, this time, let me be your opponent. The Undefeatable Divine Art is something that I’ve also wanted to ask guidance from.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Qingshan continued to maintain his gentleness and gave a smile. Without saying any words, he only nodded his head. His hands faintly hung down from his body, while a warm and affable expression appeared on his handsome face.</p>
 <p>Following the successive movements of Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, all of the gazes in the stretch of the world instantly shot towards Mu Chen, who was still standing in the air. At this moment, faint startlement and surprise appeared within the eyes of Lin Zheng, Zhou Qingshan and Gu Tianyan.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me that you’re letting him come up for the third slot?”</p>
 <p>Gu Tianyan said while faintly wrinkling his forehead. Looking at Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong in the distance, he asked, “Your batch of students should not be weak to such an extent, right? Can a Heavenly Transformation Initial Stage be a representation of your strongest?”</p>
 <p>He did not mean to look down on Mu Chen, but this was just an elaboration of the facts. After all, a youth at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase had appeared here, and this was not something that was rational.</p>
 <p>“Senior Gu Tianyan, he’ll show you something unexpected.” facing Gu Tianyan’s doubts, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong simultaneously smiled, by chance, before replying to him.</p>
 <p>“Oh, really? That truly makes me want to see it.” Gu Tianyan said while raising his eyebrows. He was, similarly, not an idiot. Since even Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had spoken out, that meant to say that the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase youth in front of him should have some methods of his own. If not, those two would definitely not let the latter carry such an important burden.</p>
 <p>Facing the doubtful gaze of Gu Tianyan, Mu Chen took a deep breath. The expression within his eyes gradually turned dignified and grave as his body slowly fluttered towards the giant peak the former was at.</p>
 <p>Regardless of the surroundings at Spiritual Light Mountain or the northern public square, both had quietened down at this instant. Countless gazes anxiously stared at Mu Chen. Of the three fights, the one he would be in would be the most unbalanced.</p>
 <p>Disregarding the gazes that hid the sky and covered the earth, Mu Chen tightly stared at Gu Tianyan. Slowly cupping his hands, a low and deep voice that contained not a single trace of fear resounded across the sky.</p>
 <p>“Senior Brother Gu, Freshmen Mu Chen of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy seeks your guidance!”</p>
