 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood as he grabbed Ji Xuan’s throat and lifted him up. Ji Xuan, who was an irresistible force earlier, was currently in his hand like a child without any ability to fight back. It was so much so that he was a little helpless in this difficult situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire area was in silence. No one spoke as they were too overwhelmed by shock to the point that they could not talk.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s counter-attack was clearly more direct and efficient.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just what was going on?</span></p>

Dense humiliation and ferocity were revealed in his eyes. Their current position nearly made his abdomen explode from all the anger. All these years, he had been proceeding forth and surpassing those in the same generation as him. He had enjoyed the countless gazes of respect, and in the past, he was the only one that stomped his opponent beneath his feet and never imagined that there would be a day for him to be in such a sorry-looking state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was definitely not something that Ji Xuan, whose pride was imprinted down to his bones, could endure. In his point of view, this was even more torturing than him being killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll shred you to pieces!” Ji Xuan roared as vast Spiritual Energy swept out like a gale. It was like an enraged dragon as it flew towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Mu Chen only swept a gaze of indifference to his attack and flicked his fingers. Purple flames gushed out and swept through the vast Spiritual Energy. In that instant of contact, the purple flames had already extinguished it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

A deep and muffled sound rang out. Ji Xuan’s chest seemed to have collapsed a little, from the looks of it, along with a mouthful of blood that spewed from his mouth, as he flew back again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

He had an icy expression and threw a punch forth with purple flames on his fist. That high temperature even caused the surrounding space to intensely distort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s fist ruthlessly fell onto Ji Xuan’s body, the high temperature wreaked havoc. The latter’s body turned red in an instant, as if he was about to combust into flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another mouthful of fresh blood spewed out as Ji Xuan’s body was shot into the crumbled Battle Stage and laid there. His entire body was covered in fresh blood, and his appearance, which was initially handsome, became extraordinarily twisted and terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He fixed his eyes at Mu Chen, who was up in midair. His gaze was so vicious, it was as if he wanted to devour him. His body trembled as he muttered, “How is that possible… how could he possess such powerful strength?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The victory was already in his grasp, but who could have expected for such an unexpected event to occur?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That power doesn’t belong to him, and in addition, his physical body is much stronger than you; thus, he could hold more power compared to you as well.” An eerie voice resounded in Ji Xuan’s heart, “Even if you have borrowed my strength, you’re only barely at First Grade Sovereign, whereas he possesses the strength of Second Grade Sovereign. So it was natural for you not being able to fight with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to kill him, I want to kill him!” Ji Xuan’s eyes turned red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure, let me control your body and killing him would be as simple as flipping my hand.” That eerie voice laughed with a scheming tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Xuan clenched his teeth. If it were some other time, he would definitely not agree to such a matter with his thinking. But when he saw the indifferent Mu Chen in midair, the resentment violently gushed out of his heart and consumed his mind. He should be the one enjoying the claps from everyone and not lying here like a dead dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There’s no way in hell I can lose to Mu Chen!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill him for me!” Ji Xuan trembled with vicious in his tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, as you wish.” That eerie voice’s laughter roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Xuan slowly shut his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood flowing out of his body stopped, his Spiritual Energy, which was in disorder awhile ago, calmed down and gradually stabilised. After that, his shut eyes slowly opened, there wasn’t any more of that viciousness and twistedness from before, but it was replaced with eeriness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly stood up and cracked his neck, felt the unfamiliar body and laughed, “Finally, I’m in control of this body…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his head as he looked at Mu Chen and smiled, “I really have to thank you for that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen knitted his brows as he looked at Ji Xuan, although there weren’t any powerful ripples around the latter, the gaze that he gave made Mu Chen feel danger. At this moment, Ji Xuan felt unfamiliar, utterly different from what he was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re the Primordial Skydragon Hawk, right?” Mu Chen spoke with no rush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re pretty smart.” Ji Xuan faintly smiled and did not deny Mu Chen’s words as he smiled, “But I’ve promised him to kill you… so I have to make you suffer a little.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his words finished, Mu Chen had already thrown a palm forth with purple flames sweeping out. It was like a giant palm of purple flames that suppressed towards Ji Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You only have some strength belonging to a Sovereign, you’re still too far away from a real Sovereign.” Looking at Mu Chen’s attacks, Ji Xuan slightly smiled as he flipped his hand over and pushed out. His palm lightly clashed with the purple flames. Although it looked like a completely different level of collision, the instant those two forces came into contact, the flaming palm crumbled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone around the Battle Stage was looking at this scene, but they were numbed by it. This battle of ups and downs had already far surpassed their understandings…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure rapidly retreated as his face was filled with graveness. The current ‘Ji Xuan’ was entirely different from before. Not only his strength, but his control over it was on a wholly new level. Clearly, the other party was a real Sovereign.</span></p>

Along with it, dark purple Spiritual Energy swept out. That Spiritual Energy was filled with a cold aura. Not only was it more refined, it was also filled with spirituality. Regarding quality, this Spiritual Energy had far surpassed those that Ji Xuan had used before.</span></p>

The scale of that giant sword wasn’t terrifying, but it possessed such a powerful pressure that even he was under that pressure and couldn’t move his body.</span></p>

However, right before that large sword was about to slice downwards, a slender and fair hand suddenly appeared behind him and with a light flick, purple flames swept out and reduced that large sword to dust.</span></p>

She had a tall and elegant appearance. As she looked around with her charming eyes, there was a trace of wildness which revealed her stubbornness. Her waist was so slim that it could be barely grabbed ahold of, especially that pair of long legs that was just perfect. The sight of her made others feel an itch in their hearts.</span></p>

Vaguely, a colossal image appeared. It was a blackbird that was flapping its wings and issued a cry that resonated throughout the heavens and earth.</span></p>

Youths nowadays are truly formidable.”</span></p>

Why haven’t I seen her before? Could it be that Mu Chen is cheating behind you?” Wen Qingxuan shot a glance at Nine Nether. The latter had an impressive appearance and temperament, even the latter’s long legs made her feel shocked. But, naturally, the most unique part was still her eyes, which were filled with wildness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li pondered for a brief moment, before softly saying, “I’m afraid she’s the Nine Nether Bird. She and Mu Chen have a Bloodlink Bond relationship. It's just that she has been in a deep slumber all these years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bloodlink Bond?” Wen Qingxuan was startled and muttered softly after, “With the pride of such a powerful Spiritual Beast like the Nine Nether Bird, how could it conduct a Bloodlink Bond with a human? What did that fellow Mu Chen do to her?”</span></p>

But a mixed chicken like you is taking things too far. Since you like to put a hand in the battle of others, then let me accompany you with that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you’re from the Nine Nether Bird clan.” Ji Xuan’s gaze was dark as he looked at Nine Nether and sneered, “According to the lifespan of the Nine Nether Bird’s clan, you’re still not at your matured stage, right? Yet you dare to challenge me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Spiritual Beast Records, the Primordial Skydragon Hawk’s ranking was higher than the Nine Nether Bird. Thus, the Primordial Skydragon Hawk wasn’t afraid of Nine Nether’s appearance.</span></p>

She then tilted her head and looked at Ji Xuan with a mocking gaze. “Furthermore, I am not a Nine Nether Bird right now… but…”</span></p>

At the same time, an indescribable pressure swept from her body that spread between the heavens and earth. In an instant, the colours of the earth and sky changed.</span></p>
