 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed on the Spiritual Jade Island, and in a blink of an eye, a month had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li and Ling Xi sat side-by-side in a bamboo pavilion with a chessboard on the table for them to kill time. There would also be waves of laughter that occasionally resounded, and it was a beautiful scene that made everything beyond this bamboo pavilion to be overshadowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the time Mu Chen was cultivating, the two ladies had intended on waiting on the island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they talked, an elderly figure suddenly appeared in the pavilion with a flash and Celestial Chi Yan had a sour face as he looked at Luo Li. “Lass, are you really not willing to be the Holy Maiden of my Ancient Spirit Clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this month, Celestial Chi Yan had come numerous times, but all of his invitations were rejected by Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Luo Li still helplessly sighed as she apologised, “Senior, I am currently the Empress of the Luo God Clan, how can I abandon them to be the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Spirit Clan? Furthermore, I’m not of the Ancient Spirit Clan’s bloodline, either…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grabbing onto his hair, Celestial Chi Yan said, “Our Ancient Spirit Clan is unlike those stubborn Ancient Clans. Our clan holds the greatest tolerance, so we do not mind the difference in the bloodline. Even if you have a thin bloodline, as long as you show great talent, then you can still become the Holy Maiden. Our clan will absolutely show no rejections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the history of our clan, we have had many outstanding Holy Maidens that received acknowledgment, even though they weren’t from our clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, even Luo Li was surprised, since this was the first time she had seen such a tolerant clan. It’s the same feeling as having an Empress in the Luo God Clan that didn’t possess any bloodline of the Luo God Clan…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Luo Li, what this Senior said isn’t false. The Ancient Spirit Clan is certainly one of the most tolerant Ancient Clans in the Great Thousand World.” Ling Xi had also nodded her head from the side and sighed, “If the Ancient Buddha Clan could also be this way, Aunt Jing wouldn’t have to be separated from Mu Chen for so many years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li gently nodded her head, but she still did not agree to it. She was no longer a young girl, so she knew that there must be many factions in a massive Ancient Clan. Just the Luo God Clan alone had left her with a headache, and if she went to become the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Spirit Clan, there was bound to be an intense competition, no matter how tolerant the Ancient Spirit Clan was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The water would inevitably run deep, which Luo Li had no intention of joining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how decisive Luo Li was, Celestial Chi Yan was a little depressed and sighed, “What a pity, I initially thought that we would be able to rush for the Primordial Sacred Abyss…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Primordial Sacred Abyss?!” Before he finished speaking, Ling Xi had exclaimed with her eyes narrowed. “The famous ominous land of the Great Thousand World, that was also the decisive battlegrounds in the ancient times?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Celestial Chi Yan nodded his head. “You’re pretty knowledgeable. That’s right; it’s&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">that</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Primordial Sacred Abyss that I’m speaking of.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Primordial Sacred Abyss is located in a storm of time and space that cannot be found. It will only show signs of when it’s appearing. I never expected that it would appear now.” Ling Xi’s gaze flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Primordial Sacred Abyss? I have vaguely heard of it before. That place is known to be dangerous, and the environment is so harsh that even a Perfected Earth Sovereign might fall in it. Why? Big Sister Ling Xi is interested in it?” Luo Li nodded her head as she asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is rumored that back in the ancient battle, there were nearly ten Heavenly Sovereigns of our Great Thousand World that fell in there, with four being Saint Heavenly Sovereigns!” Ling Xi said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Great Thousand World, even Heavenly Sovereigns were separated into levels. They were the Spirit, Immortal, and Saint grades of Heavenly Sovereign, and Saint Heavenly Sovereigns were basically the pinnacle existences in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Four Saint Heavenly Sovereigns?” Luo Li’s face slightly changed. This was definitely a terrifying formation. The moment they fell, it became an immeasurable loss to the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, one could infer from this the price that the Great Thousand World had paid to resist those Fiend Clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although we have suffered considerable losses in that battle, the Fiend Clans did not have it well, either. They have also lost ten-odd Monarchs, with four Sky Monarchs ranking amongst the Top 15.” Celestial Chi Yan added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sky Monarchs were equivalent to the Heavenly Sovereigns in the Great Thousand World, and since they could be ranked amongst the Top 15, that meant that even in the Fiend Clans, those must be supreme existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many powerhouses from both sides have fallen inside, there are also my inheritances that belong to Heavenly Sovereigns. Even Peerless Divine Artifacts, higher graded Saint Artifacts or even Peerless Artifacts are left within. So, despite being extremely dangerous, there are still many people in the Great Thousand Wold that would want to enter. If they’re lucky enough to obtain the inheritance of a Heavenly Sovereign, it would be equivalent to soaring into the sky…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, since the Primordial Sacred Abyss is located within the storm of space and time, only Heavenly sovereigns can send people in. Thus, the threshold has stopped many greedy people. But even so, there are still many people heading for it… even my Ancient Spirit Clan, as well.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Celestial Chi Yan licked his lips with a blaze in his eyes. “That’s because, amongst the four Saint Heavenly Sovereigns that fell, one of my ancestors from the Ancient Spirit Clan was amongst them. The ‘Ancient Spirit Channelling Light’ that he cultivated was one of the 36 Peerless Divine Abilities in the Great Thousand World. The might of it is boundless. Even in my Ancient Spirit Clan, it’s ranked as a top-tiered Divine Ability. It’s just a pity that with the death of that ancestor, the Peerless Divine Ability has also been lost. So it has always been the wish of my clan to seek this Divine Ability…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thus, anyone that can find the Peerless Divine Ability will surpass all the other competitors and receive the support of everyone in the Ancient Spirit Clan, becoming the Holy Maiden of my Ancient Spirit Clan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she heard it to this point, Luo Li suddenly said, “So there are competitors for the Holy Maiden position, as well? Only those that can find the Divine Ability will be able to become the Holy Maiden?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fire on Celestial Chi Yan’s face froze and he awkwardly coughed, “I’m only an envoy of the Ancient Spirit Clan searching for suitable candidates for the Holy Maiden position…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li couldn’t help rolling her eyes. She knew that it definitely wouldn’t be easy to become the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Spirit Clan. After talking so much, it’s merely as a candidate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Luo Li’s gaze, Celestial Chi Yan’s face turned red before he awkwardly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, this pavilion had returned to silence, and only Ling Xi’s gaze flashed with thoughts before she gently said, “Aside from the ‘Ancient Spirit Channelling Light’, there seems to be another Saint Heavenly Sovereign that belongs to the Ancient Buddha Clan, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Celestial Chi Yan nodded his head. “Yeah, that ancestor from the Ancient Buddha Clan was extraordinary. The Eight-Divisional Pagoda he cultivated was also one of the 36 Peerless Divine Abilities. Many Young Masters in the Ancient Buddha Clan already have plans to take that Peerless Divine Ability back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s because there’s a rule in the clan that anyone that can obtain the Eight-Divisional Pagoda will be the next Patriarch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke, Ling Xi’s eyes beamed and Luo Li looked at Ling Xi, understanding the former’s intentions. Clearly, Ling Xi wanted Mu Chen to obtain the Eight Divisional Pagoda, and Mu Chen might be able to save his mother from the Ancient Buddha Clan through other means.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li was also in agreement with this idea. It’s too tricky for Mu Chen to go through the proper channels, since the foundation of the Ancient Buddha Clan was still a little terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about it, Luo Li had also fallen into pondering. She initially wasn’t too interested in being the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Spirit Clan. In terms of inheritance, she had the Luo Shen Inheritance, and the Luo Shen Celestial Body could already become her greatest advantage in becoming a Heavenly Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if she became the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Spirit Clan, then she would have the support of a terrifying Ancient Clan behind her. If the day comes that Mu Chen’s relationship with the Ancient Buddha Clan gets completely torn apart, she might be able to grant him some help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li understood that the backing of the Luo God Clan couldn’t grant much help to Mu Chen, and if she really wanted to help Mu Chen, then she could use the Ancient Spirit Clan to do so…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wasn’t too interested in the Ancient Spirit Clan, but for Mu Chen… she’s willing to be that Holy Maiden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about that, she pursed her lips while exchanging a glance with Ling Xi. Although they did not speak, they already understood each other’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Xi’s pupils flashed with gratitude. If Luo Li did that, then she would have to compete with the other Holy Maiden candidates in the Ancient Spirit Clan, which wouldn’t be an easy matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li only lightly smiled in response.
