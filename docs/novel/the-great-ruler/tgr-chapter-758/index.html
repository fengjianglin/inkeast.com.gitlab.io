 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A raging Spiritual Energy windstorm swept out in the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond. The magma within the range of a few thousand feet was pushed out, almost as if it could tear anything apart in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This happened because the Fire Dragon Scorpion and Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python had started their battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Mei’er had said, the Fire Dragon Scorpion and Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python were mortal enemies. So if the two of them ever encountered one another, only one of them would leave here alive. Compared to this, hunting Mu Chen and Huo Mei’er were small matters, so it was more important for them to get rid of their mortal enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Spiritual Energy wreaked havoc, the light sphere that was condensed from magma managed to be sustained as it floated under the impact of Spiritual Energy, which made Mu Chen a little astonished. Clearly, this Great Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army wasn’t someone to be sniffed at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With your strength, you probably have nothing to fear if you confront one of them, right?” Mu Chen turned his head and solemnly looked at Huo Mei’er, who was watching the battle between the two colossi as he spoke in a deep voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Bing Qing&nbsp;had the strength of Fifth Grade Sovereign, so the strength of Huo Mei’er, who was the Great Commander, definitely wouldn’t be ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It would be a bit tough, the most troublesome matter is that the moment they are near death, they would destroy the Spiritual Fire Marrow in their bodies. So if I want to deal with them, I would have to do it swiftly.” Huo Mei’er cast a glance at Mu Chen and chuckled, “I don’t want to spend so much effort and yet, get nothing back in return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen understood everything under her explanation. So the Fire Dragon Scorpion and Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python still had such methods, no wonder Huo Mei’er wasn’t willing to go all-out with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How long will they take?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked outside at the violent Spiritual Energy tornado. Two colossi were frantically launching attacks at each other, their enraged roars made the magma here boil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It will take some time. They are using the terrain to their advantage, with robust Spiritual Energy. Furthermore, their strengths are somewhat similar, so it won’t be easy for a winner to emerge from them so easily.” Huo Mei’er casually said with certainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head and spoke nothing else, calming his heart as he watched the struggle between the two colossi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It went just as Huo Mei’er had expected, the battle lasted for a long time. The Spiritual Energy storm lasted for nearly half an hour, before the fluctuations gradually weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Huo Mei’er directed their gazes over, and Mu Chen couldn’t help inhaling a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the magma, the two colossi were facing off, except that they were covered in wounds now. Two of the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python’s heads had been sliced off, the Fire Dragon Scorpion was also covered in wounds, gravely injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two colossi were greatly weakened right now. The ferocious light in their eyes weakened a little, but they still kept their guard up against one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they did not have any intelligence, their instincts told them that there wouldn’t be any good outcome if they were to continue their fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the two colossi showed signs of retreating from their confrontation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’ve decided to retreat!” Mu Chen’s face changed a little at this scene. If those two colossi retreated, then they would have wasted half a day’s time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er’s brows briefly knitted, before she stretched out her slender finger and lightly flicked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with Huo Mei’er’s gentle flick, a beam of scarlet Spiritual Energy abruptly burst out. As it flew out, it coiled against the raging magma and shot from the rear of the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python towards the Fire Dragon Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Magma exploded from the body of the Fire Dragon Scorpion, instantly causing it to issue a painful howl, before directing its scarlet gaze at the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python and frantically pounced forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it did not have a high intelligence, it had thought that the attack was launched by the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the Fire Dragon Scorpion pouncing forth, the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python had also unleashed a warning roar. But seeing that it was ineffective, a ferocious light surged from its eyes and it charged without any fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two colossi clashed once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this scene, Mu Chen couldn’t help raising his thumbs at Huo Mei’er and smiled. “What a good diversion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er returned an alluring smile. Her smile was extremely charming, which made Mu Chen feel even more aware that this alluring lady before him was a thorny rose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could someone that could become a Great Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army be a simple person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s your name?” Staring at the bloody fight of the two colossi, Huo Mei’er casually asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Nether Palace, Mu Chen.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, you’re the new Commander that Nine Nether brought back?” Hearing that name, Huo Mei’er eyes, which were staring at the battle, shifted as she looked at Mu Chen with a slightly peculiar gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. “You know Nine Nether?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, we are good sisters. We entered the Great Havenlaw Domain together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er let out a pampered laugh as her gaze revolved around Mu Chen. Thereafter, she moved her body closer and chuckled, “Say, tell this Big Sister what your relationship with her is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen dryly laughed as his gaze rolled, he clearly didn’t believe Huo Mei’er’s words. If she and Nine Nether really had a good relationship, why had he not hear about her from Nine Nether? Furthermore, there are hints if rivalry in Huo Mei’er’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a cautious little fellow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er gently rubbed Mu Chen’s face. She lightly cast her lips aside and did not speak anymore, but directed her attention out. “In a while, when the two of them are heavily injured, I can only instantly deal with one. If you want the other Spiritual Fire Marrow, then you will have to depend on yourself to kill it at the fastest speed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned and lightly knitted his brows. Whether it was the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python or the Fire Dragon Scorpion, both of their strengths far exceeded his. Even if the both of them were gravely injured, he couldn’t see how he could have an easy time. Not to mention that he had to deal with them at the fastest speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was a little difficult, Mu Chen did not say a single word, since he could tell from Huo Mei’er’s tone that there wasn’t any intention of helping him. The sudden change of attitude must be because of Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There must be something going on between Huo Mei’er and Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen did not have the mood to investigate their relationship. Although he might seem gentle on the outside, those that knew him after some time knew that this youth was prideful deep in his bones as well. Since Huo Mei’er wasn’t interested in helping him, then he would naturally not bring down his head to beg her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Mu Chen had only gently nodded his head at Huo Mei’er’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Mei’er was staring at the outside battle, the corner of her eyes was looking at Mu Chen. So when she saw that Mu Chen’s brows were briefly knitted before relaxing, she couldn’t help twitching her brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She really did have a complicated relationship with Nine Nether. Back then, when the Great Havenlaw Domain was nominating a new King, she and Nine Nether had the highest chance. But in the end, when Nine Nether became the Nine Nether King, she entered into the Great Havenlaw Army and became the Great Commander, step by step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when she controlled the Great Havenlaw Army back then, Nine Nether had disappeared, which made her lose her target. Her long years of effort seemed to have suddenly lost all meaning to it, a feeling that made her a little at a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that Nine Nether had returned, her fighting spirit was ignited once again and she wanted Nine Nether to admit that she, Huo Mei’er, was stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the competitive relationship of the two ladies, when she heard that Mu Chen was the new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace whose name had been rapidly spreading, she couldn’t help having slight thoughts of making things difficult for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, she wasn’t going overboard. As long as Mu Chen showed slight signs of lowering his head, then she would naturally not mind helping him. But who could have thought that this young man that seemed gentle would have such intense pride deep in his bones?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll let you be stubborn, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er unnoticeably cast her rosy lips aside. In her view, Mu Chen’s baseless pride was just useless stubbornness. He couldn’t understand the situation and endure. In the end, he was still a little too tender. So she couldn’t figure out what Nine Nether had seen in him to the point that she even brought him back to the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smear of a chill flashed in Huo Mei’er’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that is the case, then it would be better for him to die here instead of embarrassing Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those thoughts were circulating in Huo Mei’er’s heart, Mu Chen had his eyes fixed on the battle as thoughts on how to achieve success endlessly flowed in his mind.</span></p>
