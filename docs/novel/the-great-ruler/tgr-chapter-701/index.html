 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the torrential ominous aura from the Nine Nether Palace soared into the horizon, it startled many factions in the Great Havenlaw Domain. Shortly after, there were gazes directed over in the direction of the Nine Nether Troop, with profound meanings behind those gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Palace had sent a notice to those cities that were once under them, but the news that there were only a few that were willing to comply had already spread throughout the Great Havenlaw Domain. Undoubtedly, it had attracted some mockery with the Blood Hawk Hall being the strongest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But mockery was still mockery. Everyone knew that the Nine Nether Palace would definitely not let this matter rest. Otherwise, there might not be a spot for the Nine Nether Palace in the Great Havenlaw Domain for much longer. A force with its reputation damaged to such an extent, even if Nine Nether had the support of Sky Vulture Emperor, it was also hard for the Nine Nether Palace to remain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But judging from the current situation, the Nine Nether Palace was clearly going to take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the development of the Nine Nether Palace had been the weakest amongst the factions of the Nine Kings. Even though Nine Nether had successfully undergone her Tribulation, a force could not depend on her to grow stronger. The other Kings’ factions all had powerful subordinates beneath them, and aside from Mu Chen, the remaining subordinates under Nine Nether were somewhat ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The competition between the Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain depended on their subordinates. As a King, they were not allowed to take action… so it was still doubtful if the Nine Nether Palace’s actions could obtain any results.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Mu Chen’s performance at the Greatlaw Goldpond was perfect, he was still an individual. Whereas those City Lords were all formidable figures, some of those pinnacle experts even had some fame in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, there were two outcomes. Whether the Nine Nether Palace could succeed in seizing the cities back, or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk Hall</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside a hall, the Blood Hawk King was seated on a throne, gently fondling the armrest. His scarlet eyes looked out of the hall with a smear of a ruminating smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Nether Palace has already started to act.” The Blood Hawk King faintly smiled as he looked towards Wu Tian, who was below, indifferently. “Are all the preparations done?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All the City Lords are gathering towards the Demonic Python City. As long as he goes there, he can forget about taking the reputation that they had lost back.” Wu Tian eerily smiled. All those that could become a City Lord all had decent strength. The pinnacle experts amongst them weren’t any weaker than the Four Great Domain Lords. It was only that their ages were somewhat old, incomparable to the Four Great Domain Lords in regards to potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now that they have all gathered together, they would be a force to be reckoned with. Aside from Nine Nether, the Nine Nether Palace only had Mu Chen that could be looked at. But if he wanted to confront so many City Lords with his strength, it could simply be said that he was stupid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A woman is still a woman, in the end. It’s hard to have great accomplishments.” The Blood Hawk King faintly smiled. Although Nine Nether’s strength soared upon her return, she was too hasty in handling things. The foundation of the Nine Nether Palace was too weak, and how could be it easy for her to take back all the territories that had switched allegiances. Did she think that his threats were in vain after all these years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the youth named Mu Chen had a pretty good potential, which of those City Lords weren’t cunning? Furthermore, with his support behind them, Mu Chen might throw all the reputation that he had gotten with great effort from the Greatlaw Goldpond away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, perhaps that young woman, Nine Nether, will know of the gap between the Nine Nether Palace and the Blood Hawk Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demonic Python City</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a city on a massive scale, sitting at the northwestern region of the Great Havenlaw Domain. It was one of the important cities of the Great Havenlaw Domain. The flourishing degree could be in the top ranks in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, when Nine Nether Palace was able to take the city under them, many people had red eyes. So when she went missing, the Blood Hawk King was the first to act and swallowed this city up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demonic Python City today was clearly especially bustling. The end could not be seen on the horizon of the city as light silhouettes flew over from all directions, landing in this city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Teleportation Spiritual Array in the city was also continuously flickering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day before, there was news sent out that the City Lord of the Demonic Python City, Luo Mang, had gathered fifty other City Lords in the Demonic Python City. Those that were well-informed naturally knew the motive for this. It was precisely to confront the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although, strictly speaking, everyone was under the Great Havenlaw Domain. But in the recent years, the Nine Nether Palace was in decline, and Luo Mang also had a pretty big ambition. He naturally didn’t want to offend the Blood Hawk Hall so easily because, in his eyes, the Nine Nether Palace had declined and was incomparable to the Blood Hawk Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He naturally had quite a bit of support from the Blood Hawk Hall, which was the reason why he dared to gather people so openly to confront the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a vast plaza in the centre of the Demonic Python City, with the statue of a massive Demonic Python that was a thousand feet in height, overlooking the entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, the plaza was already filled with a multitude of people causing a commotion, and there were light figures constantly flying over, hovering in the sky of this plaza. Some of the buildings were filled with silhouettes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single gaze was directed beneath the Demonic Python statue, where dozens of stone chairs with dozens of figures were seated. Vaguely, tremendous Spiritual Energy swept out from their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those dozens of silhouettes had a steady aura and light surging in their eyes. They were clearly not ordinary figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And amongst those people, there were three whose surrounding Spiritual Energy was the thickest. One of them wore black robes, with a tall and study body. His hair was short and a smear of smile hung on his boorish face. His deep gaze was like a venomous snake. When he looked around, he brought a chill to the hearts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a black Demonic Python tattoo stretching out on his neck. The ferocious snake had a biting posture and the savage sight gave off a bizarre feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled with narrowed eyes and was leaning on the stone chair, while fondling the armrest with his hand. He wasn’t the slightest bit worried about the rage that would soon erupt from the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was the City Lord of the Demonic Python City, Luo Mang. He had been in control of the Demonic Python City for many years, a cunning and ruthless person. Also, he had stepped into the Second Grade Sovereign many years ago. He could be considered as being at the pinnacle of Second Grade Sovereign. He was powerful and even had decent fame amongst the City Lords in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside Luo Mang, there were two somewhat skinny middle-aged men. They were the City Lords of the Blood Vulture City and Black Cliff City, with their strengths similarly reaching Second Grade Sovereign. But their gazes were flickering. They, apparently, weren’t as calm as Luo Mang. No matter what, offending the Nine Nether Palace wasn’t a comforting matter. Rumour had it that Nine Nether had also succeeded her Tribulation and her strength was comparable to a Fifth Grade Sovereign, being no weaker than the Blood Hawk King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The two of you do not need to worry, although Nine Nether is incomparable to the past, the foundation of her Nine Nether Palace is weak. Even if the new Commander has some ability, it is rumoured that he is a brat. It’s hard for him to pose a threat in any situation.” Seemingly to have sensed the worries of the two people by his side, Luo Mang faintly smiled as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, the faces of the City Lords of the Blood Vulture City and Black Cliff City somewhat eased a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will display a formation here. Even if that brat comes, he will not dare to say anything. At that time, we will suppress him a little before speaking nicely to him. I believe it will be enough to shake him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Mang smiled. “Also, don’t forget about the promise Lord Blood Hawk King has given us. As long as we resist the Nine Nether Palace, we will officially join the Blood Hawk Hall. At that time, when will we fear Nine Nether?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two City Lords nodded their heads. If they could genuinely enter the Blood Hawk Hall, it was indeed better than being a City Lord and do bitter work. After all, even if the income of those cities was bountiful, the majority of it had to be handed over.</span></p>

As long as we manage to block those of the Nine Nether Palace this time, they will know what to choose.”</span></p>

Just when they were about to speak, their gazes abruptly froze as they raised their heads, looking at the northwestern direction of the city. There was a massive pillar of light that soared into the horizon.</span></p>

It was indeed the Great Havenlaw Domain, even the weakest Nine Nether Palace had a troop of such grandeur.</span></p>

The one thousand people did not speak a word and had only swept their cold gazes filled with killing intent around.</span></p>

The patch of black clouds split apart and a slim figure slowly walked out of it.</span></p>

Shortly after, he lightly smiled as he said in a faint voice, “A pretty good formation is laid out.”</span></p>
