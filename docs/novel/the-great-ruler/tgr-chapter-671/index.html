After that, every single gaze rose and gathered on the youth who was rather calm standing behind Nine Nether.</span></p>

Although it wasn’t easy for a youth like him to possess this sort of strength, the position of Great Havenlaw Domain’s Commander didn't merely depend on talent alone, it depended on the power you possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But clearly, the pressure emitted from Mu Chen was too hard to convince others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Asura King gave Mu Chen a glance without any emotion. He did not speak, but the man named Xu Qing, who was behind him, gave Mu Chen another glimpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King was looking at Mu Chen with his eyes narrowed, his gaze was like a venomous snake that brought a chill down the spine of others. He gave Mu Chen a glance and lifted the corner of his lips, “Who is he? He doesn’t seem to be someone of our Great Havenlaw Domain, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He will be from today onwards. As the head of the Nine Nether Palace, I naturally have the rights to determine the Commander of my Nine Nether Palace. I believe that not even you can care about this, right?” Nine Nether said with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Blood Hawk King hung his eyes down, “Although you have already said so, the Nine Nether Palace is still under the Great Havenlaw Domain. The Domain Lords of my Great Havenlaw Domain have all obtained their position through their achievements. If you casually pointed someone<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"> to have this position easily, what are you treating the other Domain Lords as?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the Commander that you have appointed does not have the strength to back it up, we might be mocked by others thinking that we have no one capable in our Great Havenlaw Domain. So you alone can’t determine the appointment of a Commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing behind the Blood Hawk King, Wu Tian and Cao Feng were staring at Mu Chen. The former didn’t think much, but the latter’s gaze was a little dark. When he recalled the time Nine Nether brought him back, in the past, she had also given him the position of Commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Except that when Nine Nether left the Nine Nether Palace for so many years, he had given up the Nine Nether Palace in the end. A Nine Nether Palace without Nine Nether was far inferior compared to the Blood Hawk King, except he never thought that Nine Nether would return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And this time, she had brought back a youth along with her…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you using him to replace me?” An eerie light flashed across Cao Feng’s eyes as he glared at Mu Chen with a dark gaze. His gaze was similar to overlooking as Mu Chen’s</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">strength was far inferior compared to himself.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the hall, there were some of the seven remaining Kings nodding their head as well, showing to be in agreement with Blood Hawk King’s opinion. Many of them had relations with the Blood Hawk King, back then, it was also them that had allied together and attempted to disband the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching the situation, Nine Nether’s gaze grew colder, but it wasn’t unexpected for her. Evidently, she had expected that today’s matter won’t be easy to handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seated on the three lotus stage, Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor remained silence as they allowed everyone to argue. As for the Sleeping Emperor, he had maintained sleepy eyes as he seemed to have fallen asleep, as though no matter on earth could wake him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing and Tang Rou had also gritted their teeth, hating those that obstructed Nine Nether to death in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly smiled as he strode half a step forth, his looked at Blood Hawk King, whose eyes seem as if it could pierce through the body of others with a smile, “Then I wonder how can I get the qualification to be a Commander, Blood Hawk King?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King cast a glance at Mu Chen as he leaned against the stone chair, his eyes were hung down as though there wasn’t even an interest for him to talk. He didn’t feel that Mu Chen has the qualification to speak with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was indeed so, he was one of the Nine Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain, the existence of the Fifth Grade Sovereign with experts as many as clouds under him. A single point of his could determine the life and death of others, if it weren’t for Nine Nether standing behind Mu Chen, he would have long killed him, how would he even bother himself with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King’s actions made the chill in Nine Nether’s eyes to grow, but Mu Chen still maintained a calm smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s simple to prove your qualification…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the Four Great Domain Lords standing behind Blood Hawk King, Wu Tian suddenly laughed, revealing his white teeth, “As long as you can defeat a Commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The killing intent in his eyes wasn’t concealed, he didn’t find Mu Chen to his eyes as he doesn’t like anyone being close to the sisters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen smiled as his black pupils were shifted to Wu Tian and laughed, “That’s a pretty good idea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he finished speaking, his figure moved and appeared on the vast hall and looked around, “I wonder if any Commander here is interested in spar?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t overly humble as he had already seen through that it wasn’t useful in being humble here. Over here, only those with true strength can have the right of speech. Otherwise, no one would care about him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pretty good courage.” The head of the Four Great Domain Lords standing behind Mountain Splitting King, Zhou Yue frowned his brows. However, he didn’t have any intentions of interfering. Anyone can tell that this was the battle between the Nine Nether King and Blood Hawk King, as someone of the Mountain Splitting King’s faction, he naturally wouldn’t interfere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Further, he didn’t find the Blood Hawk King’s faction to his eyes as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining kings were somewhat interested as they watched this scene. Even those who had good relations with the Blood Hawk King did not stand out. Although they didn’t care much about Mu Chen, they had feared for Nine Nether, who had succeeded her tribulations and her strength grew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tian laughed, revealing his white teeth that were similar to that of a beast. He was looking at Mu Chen with ridicule, he doesn’t seem to understand why would this youth before him be so courageous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it showed his talent to be able to reach the Sovereign Realm at his age, there were, after all, too many geniuses in the world. And the majority of those would die from being too prideful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tian naturally sensed that Mu Chen had only reached the Sovereign Realm recently as the spiritual energies fluctuation on him wasn’t as thick as those that had entered the Sovereign Realm for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhao Zhong, you go and see if he has the qualification to become a Commander.” Wu Tian lightly turned his head and spoke to a man behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He naturally wishes to kill this youth before him, but he was one of the Four Great Domain Lords with fame widely spread in Great Havenlaw Domain. If he were to act against such an impudent youth, it would be lowering his status.</span></p>

He did not act as well as he had the same thoughts as Wu Tian.</span></p>

He was also a Commander under the Blood Hawk King, though his fame wasn’t comparable to Wu Tian and Cao Feng, he had been in the First Grade Sovereign Realm for a long time with experience over hundreds of battle backing him. His actions emitted terrifying killing intent. Clearly, he had experienced all sorts of life and death battles.</span></p>

Except the gaze that was leaked from the corner of his eyes were similar to watching a monkey show.</span></p>

He looked at Mu Chen and revealed a savage and cruel smile on the corner of his lips. He had seen many talented youths like Mu Chen, there was a considerable amount that had died in his hands as well.</span></p>

Perhaps you will suffer a little if you get lost now, or you can join our Blood Hawk Hall. At the very least, it’s better compared to a woman palace.” Zhao Yue revealed an eerie smile towards Mu Chen.</span></p>

Nine Nether, however, did not have any movements as she looked at Mu Chen’s silhouette.</span></p>

Wasn’t that fellow too arrogant? He had not even refined his Sovereign Celestial Body, and he dared to act so impudently here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Tang Bing and Tang Rou’s face slightly changed as they didn’t know that Mu Chen had yet to refine his Sovereign Celestial Body.</span></p>

He strode a step forth, sweeping out terrifying spiritual energies. A large spiritual light figure appeared behind him.</span></p>

When Zhao Yue heard that Mu Chen had yet to refine his Sovereign Celestial Body, he didn’t have any intentions of going lenient. On the contrary, he became even more ruthless by summoning his Sovereign Celestial Body right from the start, he was apparently trying to give Mu Chen a harsh impact with the fastest speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sovereign Celestial Body that he had refined wasn’t rare, it wasn’t even among the 99 Rankings of Sovereign Celestial Bodies. But it was more than enough to deal with a brat that has yet to even refine his Sovereign Celestial Body.</span></p>

Under that calm, there were chill flowing.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr">Mu Chen formed seals with a single hand, there wasn’t any hesitation in him as a pillar of spiritual light shot out from his head. Within the pillar of light, there was a black pagoda of light<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"> that faintly appeared.</span></p>
