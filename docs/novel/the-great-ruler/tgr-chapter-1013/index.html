 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s black pupils were directed over, Zong Teng had an extremely ugly expression and he couldn’t help taking half a step back. The incredible scene of Lu Sui being defeated by Mu Chen in a single punch had left quite the effect on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zong Teng was, after all, not an ordinary goon. Immediately, he had calmed his heart down and his gaze looked at Mu Chen with solemn and even fear. If Mu Chen was someone that could only be faced up to in the past, then the latter had truly made him feel a fatal threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have underestimated you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s low voice resounded with regret in his heart. If he had known that Mu Chen would have such improvements in the Body Refining Pagoda, then he would have dealt with him right from the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Mu Chen was clearly even more threatening than Mo Feng and Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I admit defeat on this matter, I will compensate you 1,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid and we will call this matter off. How about it?” Zong Teng looked at Mu Chen’s glaring eyes, then he suddenly gnashed his teeth and firmly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of the surround experts had bizarre expressions on their faces. Who could have expected for Zong Teng, who was full of complacency, to admit defeat and want to resolve this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But not everyone was too shocked by this. After witnessing Mu Chen’s shocking strength, even Zong Teng would not have any intention to start a battle at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Sui was punched to the point that no one knew whether he was dead or alive and they could only dream on depending on the experts of the Thunder Crow Clan. If their Sky Roc Clan faced the Nine Netherbird Clan alone, then they would obviously be at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since that’s the case, they should admit defeat so they could still preserve their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen did not have a change in his expression when Zong Teng admitted defeat once again, since he had already seen through him. If he didn’t make someone like Zong Teng feel pain, then Zong Teng would probably not remember it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen’s gaze, Zong Teng understood that perhaps this time, Mu Chen had been thoroughly enraged. Perhaps a mere 1,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid might not be able to resolve the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, Zong Teng’s brows slowly knitted together, then he looked at Mu Chen with cold eyes. He no longer wanted to cower and faintly said, “Since that’s the case. Then I, Zong Teng, will see today if you can defeat me in a single punch like Lu Sui. If you’re able to do that, then you can take my life as you wish!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng was truly a ruthless and decisive person. Since he knew that it was futile to admit defeat, he threw that thought away. Since Mu Chen wanted to flaunt his might, then he could only display his own strength, letting Mu Chen know the meaning of mutual fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re still somewhat courageous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing how decisive Zong Teng was, Mu Chen nodded his head. Compared to Lu Sui, Zong Teng was truly a level higher. It was no wonder why he could become the most outstanding person amongst the younger generations of the Sky Roc Clan. Furthermore, his fame had also spread outside the Sky Roc Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he had already made his decision, Zong Teng no longer hesitated and his gaze grew cold and a boundless Spiritual Energy swept from his body. Vaguely, there was a brilliant cry of a great roc that resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pressure that was emanating from Zong Teng had caused many experts to look with grave expressions. Even amongst the Seventh Grade Sovereigns, Zong Teng’s strength was decent and compared to Lu Sui, he was clearly stronger. It’s no wonder why he could have such fame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen’s expression was calm in response. If he had not broken through to the second level of the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, then he would definitely have to show all his trump cards to deal with Zong Teng. It was so much so that he might even have to set up Spiritual Arrays. But right now… there was no longer a need for such trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Spiritual Energy swept out, Zong Teng’s silhouette had exploded with golden light, then he threw a fist forth. As the golden light surged, a golden roc had formed onto his fist. It flapped its wings and an indescribable piercing aura swept out that sliced the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Divine Roc Shadow Fist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding experts had immediately backed down, since Zong Teng clearly knew how formidable Mu Chen was. Therefore, he had also gone all-out with his fist, which was something that even someone like Lu Sui had to hide from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden fist, which carried the golden roc, exploded in the sky and turned into a golden light, then it flew towards Mu Chen with the golden light swiftly expanding in his eyes. In the next moment, Mu Chen had also thrown a fist out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden light also surged on his fist but there weren’t any Spiritual Energy fluctuations, it was purely the strength of his physique alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two golden fists heavily clashed together and a horrifying impact exploded. The earth beneath their feet had also shattered with the ruins in the surroundings having been reduced to dust from the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the impact wreaked havoc, Mu Chen’s body jolted and he had forcefully borne that force down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Zong Teng, he was forced to take a step back, leaving a deep mark on the ground. But still, one could tell that Zong Teng wasn’t weak. Mu Chen’s fist had previously heavily injured Lu Sui, but as for Zong Teng, it had merely caused him to take a step back. Both of them were Seventh Grade Sovereigns, but no one expected for the gap to be so huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had only taken a step back, Zong Teng’s face grew even darker. That’s because only he knew how terrifying Mu Chen’s power and physical body were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that previous punch, he had used both his Spiritual Energy and physical strength, but Mu Chen had merely used his physical strength to clash with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could that fellow’s physical body grow so powerful in such a short amount of time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Zong Teng was bewildered in his head, Mu Chen grinned and did not give the former any time to prepare. He had taken a step forth and a golden light shot out, enveloping towards Zong Teng once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his current physical strength, it wasn’t possible for him to gain complete control over his own strength. With such a good practice partner before him, he would naturally not let it go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As thoughts flashed in his heart, Mu Chen had already turned into a golden light and shot out. The golden fist drew afterimages that enveloped towards Zong Teng from every direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Mu Chen’s ferocious attacks, even Zong Teng could only use his Spiritual Energy to fight head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous punches were exchanged, causing the air to roll in waves, shaking the horizon. Every single solemn noise exploded like thunder with violent energy sweeping out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts had dull expressions as they looked at the clashes in the sky. Beneath their feet, deep ravines were endlessly spreading out on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the two lights, what made them feel bewildered was the fact that Zong Teng, who was surging with Spiritual Energy around him, was actually losing to Mu Chen, who did not have any Spiritual Energy fluctuation around him.</span></p>

It was so much so that even the Spiritual Energy that swept around him would be dispersed quite a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone finally knew how terrifying Mu Chen’s physical body was… That fellow’s physical body was practically more fearsome than themselves, who had the bodies of Divine Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They really wondered how that monster cultivated his physical body, since they knew how difficult it was to cultivate it…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several experts of the Sky Roc Clan were dumbfounded as they watched Zong Teng retreating. Especially Liu Qing, her face even alternated between green and white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, she was even looking down on Mu Chen’s identity as a human and his strength only at the Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm. But right now, Zong Teng, who she had always respected, was in such a miserable state by the human that she had looked down on… The contrast had made her feel dizzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Mu Chen is too formidable!” Mo Ling widened her eyes with stars sparkling within them and revere was on her face as she looked at Mu Chen, who had a torrential aura at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Feng also had a grave expression. His strength was somewhat similar to Zong Teng’s and Zong Teng was in such a miserable state at this moment. That also meant that Mu Chen’s fighting prowess had also probably surpassed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like Mu Chen should have gotten a breakthrough on his physical body in the Body Refining Pagoda.” Nine Nether also had shock in her eyes, since she understood Mu Chen too well. Even if his physical body was powerful back then, it wasn’t at such a level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Feng’s expression changed, then he sighed in the end. “I’m afraid that his method was the authentic one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought back to the scene when Mu Chen walked from the first level of the Body Refining Pagoda. While they were using all sorts of means to speed up in order to obtain the opportunities in the Body Refining Pagoda, Mu Chen opted for the most primitive refining method…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely that kind of cultivation that allowed Mu Chen’s physical body to be improved so much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether had also gently nodded her head. While others were blinded by the opportunities of Divine Abilities and Saint Artifacts, only Mu Chen maintained the most steady method, walking through the brutal environment of the Body Refining Pagoda to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Mu Chen was clearly the one that had obtained the most precious opportunity in the Body Refining Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen is making Zong Teng into his practice partner.” Looking back at the fight, Nine Nether’s gaze contracted with a faint smile in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could already sense that in less than ten-odd minutes, the hundred-plus fists that Mu Chen had thrown out were getting more refined. They were no longer as violent as they used to be. They’re easy to unleash and hard to retract.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, Mu Chen was using Zong Teng to test the increase in his strength.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng had also clearly sensed Mu Chen’s control over his strength reaching perfection. Therefore, he understood that unless he put his life on the line in this fight, the chances of him winning would not be high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mo Feng finished his words, Zong Teng’s body blossomed with a golden light and afterimages flew out. With a change, he had already turned into a thousand-foot long golden roc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The claws of the roc stretched, grabbing onto the party of the Sky Roc Clan, then countless golden runes appeared on both of its wings. With a single flap, a violent gale blew and it had turned into a golden light, then it bolted towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s sudden escape had caused everyone to be dumbfounded.</span></p>

Thereafter, he clenched his fist and the golden feathered sword appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Waving the feathered sword down, he had poured all the Spiritual Energy and physical strength in his body into it.</span></p>

Fresh blood sprinkled on his back as a crimson lustre enveloped him, making him look invincible at this moment.</span></p>
