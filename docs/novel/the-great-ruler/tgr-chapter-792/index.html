It was a vast grandeur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, a figure stood in the air as the golden light burst out in every direction. Behind him was an image of a dragon and phoenix that brought along an earth-shaking draconic roar and phoenix cry, before entering his body and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lowered his head. His hands were slowly clenched together as the energy in his body whistled like tidal waves. That extreme sense of power felt like the sky could collapse and the earth would crack the moment it exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This powerful power of a physique was something that Mu Chen had never experienced before. Even the Lightning God’s Physique wasn’t strong to this degree. He could sense an immense change in his body compared to before. The strong vitality was unprecedented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least, the immense pain that he had suffered was completely worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen grinned as his figure moved and appeared before the super Dragon-Phoenix Pool. He looked at Cai Xiao and sincerely said, “Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was submerged in a deep cultivation state, he also sensed that the Dragon-Phoenix’s Blood Essences had suddenly become more vigorous. It wasn’t from the Dragon-Phoenix Pool but the extremely precious Dragon-Phoenix Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for this Dragon-Phoenix Fruit, his cultivation would definitely come to an end. If that was the case, then not only would he not be able to successfully form the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, he would have even wasted so many treasures and suffered a huge loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he was somewhat touched by Cai Xiao’s actions. After all, he had benefited quite a bit from their cooperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao faintly smiled without minding, before looking at Mu Chen with interest and gently pinched Mu Chen’s arm as she chuckled, “Indeed worthy of being the Dragon-Phoenix Physique. There’s indeed something worth seeing about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a vast experience, thus having a keen eye. Naturally, she could sense the stunning vitality contained within Mu Chen’s body. With this vitality, as long as Mu Chen didn’t suffer a devastating injury, he would be able to swiftly recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head as well. He was also extremely satisfied with how powerful the Dragon-Phoenix Physique was. If he were to encounter Liu Yan again, the outcome would probably be clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his current strength at Third Grade Sovereign, with the Great Solar Undying Body and the Dragon-Phoenix Physique that he had just acquired, there might not be anyone beneath Fifth Grade Sovereign that could confront him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like this physique of yours is pretty good.” Cai Xiao praised. If it was someone ordinary, even with the Dragon-Phoenix Fruit, it wouldn’t be possible for them to form the Dragon-Phoenix Physique. Since she could tell that the Dragon-Phoenix Physique was extremely overbearing, those whose physiques were slightly weaker wouldn’t be able to bear the power of the Dragon-Phoenix’s Blood Essences. At that time, not only would their blood be incinerated, even their body wouldn’t be able to take it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled. Although right now, the Lightning God’s Physique that he had cultivated might not be the most powerful Body Refining Technique out there, it had something that other techniques did not. The Lightning God’s Physique could thoroughly refine the body, in and out. It couldn’t bestow the cultivator an incredibly powerful physique, but it granted the cultivator a good physique. This way, when they cultivate other Body Refining Techniques in the future, the efficacy would be greatly increased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although you have formed the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, you will not be able to bring out its full power through ordinary means.” Cai Xiao pondered for a brief moment before saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Mu Chen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re human, after all, and do not know the potential contained within this Dragon-Phoenix Physique. If you want to cultivate it to the fullest potential, you will need to rely on the cultivation techniques of the True Dragon and Phoenix.” said Cai Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cultivation techniques of the True Dragon and Phoenix?” Mu Chen frowned his brows. The True Dragon and Phoenix clans were apex existences in the world. Their cultivation techniques were the pinnacle, even amongst their clans, so there weren’t that many experts and forces in the Great Thousand World that would dare go to the two powerful clans to steal their cultivation techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why steal, isn’t there one in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven?” Cai Xiao rolled her eyes at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen instantly understood. “You’re talking about the inheritance left behind by the True Dragon and Phoenix?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he helplessly smiled. The Dragon-Phoenix Haven had opened so many times over the years, but there wasn’t anyone that managed to obtain the inheritance of the True Dragon and Phoenix. Thus, the difficulty went without saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was confident, he did not dare to guarantee that he could obtain those inheritances. Furthermore, there were many outstanding talents gathered in this Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Everyone had their eyes on the inheritance left behind by the True Dragon and Phoenix, including elites like Fang Yi, Netherworld Prince, Su Biyue, etc… The two former possessed terrifying strength that could even confront Cai Xiao. Therefore, it was clearly not an easy task to stand out amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, you’re scared?” Cai Xiao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not to the point of feeling scared, just that there’s a little difficulty.” Mu Chen smiled as he looked into the distance. A fighting intent was ablaze within his black pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However… I do want to personally experience how powerful the elites of the Northern Region’s younger generation are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao looked at the youth before her. From her pupils, she saw ambition, a powerful ambition of seeking the height in the path of Dao. Furthermore, that ambition didn’t seem to be baseless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so much so that she couldn’t help believing a little. Perhaps in the distant future, this youth before her would tower the summit of the heavens and earth and overlook this land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, it will all be clear if I’m boasting when we go to the Dragon-Phoenix Stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That made Cai Xiao dazed for a brief moment, before she smiled. She did not say anything, but inwardly muttered in her heart, “What an interesting fellow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already finished enjoying the Dragon-Phoenix Fruit and Pool, so the two of them did not have a reason to stay here any further. After slightly tidying up, they had directly left this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Counting the time, it had been over a day since they entered the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. However, there wasn’t an indication of day and night in this Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Therefore, the time had unconsciously passed by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t a short time, and according to Mu Chen’s guesses, the five Dragon-Phoenix Pools had probably been divided up at this moment. Only that he didn’t know who the other four that obtained the four other Dragon-Phoenix Pools were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now that the Dragon-Phoenix Pools were divided up, many geniuses must’ve been making their way towards the important Dragon-Phoenix Stage… As it was rumoured to contain the inheritance of the dragon and phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Likewise, their target was there as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So both of them did not stop in their journey. After determining the direction, they had pushed their speeds to the limits and had completely left this desolated land in just four-to-six hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, Mu Chen encountered many experts grouped together. However, those people did not make their way towards the Dragon-Phoenix Pool, they had joined together as they robbed those who travelled alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An extremely low number of those experts could obtain a Dragon-Phoenix Pool in this Dragon-Phoenix Haven. However, there were many natural treasures in this domain, thus being those fellow’s targets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when they placed their greed on Mu Chen and Cai Xiao, they had clearly gone out of luck. Thus, Mu Chen managed to obtain lots of information that happened in that one day in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>

Amongst the eight, he had obtained one of them. Su Biyue of the Myriad Saints Mountain, Demon’s Gate’s Hong Yu and Spiritual Giant Clan’s Ding Xuan had each obtained a Dragon-Phoenix Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Mu Chen most startled was the owners for the four remaining Dragon-Phoenix Pools. Amongst the four, the Netherworld Prince had obtained two. Fang Yi, who had snatched a Dragon-Phoenix Fruit from their hands, had obtained one, whereas the last was actually taken by Liu Yan…</span></p>

Looks like the six of them have all formed the Ersatz Dragon Physique or the Ersatz Phoenix Physique. I wonder how many runes they have achieved.”</span></p>

Truly, those that could participate in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven were all elites of the elites.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. Although Fang Yi had only obtained a Dragon-Phoenix Pool, he had a Dragon-Phoenix Fruit. Even if it wasn’t ripe, but if he could successfully refine it, the Blood Essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix in it would far exceed an ordinary Dragon-Phoenix Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whereas the Netherworld Prince had obtained two Dragon-Phoenix Pools, so the Ersatz Dragon Physique or Ersatz Phoenix Physique wouldn’t be weak.</span></p>

Therefore, there might be some with pretty good luck that managed to obtained them and also formed the Ersatz Dragon Physique or Ersatz Phoenix Physique. They too, are qualified to ascend the Dragon-Phoenix Stage.”</span></p>

In the void that his sight could not reach, he seemed to have caught sight of a majestic and vast ancient stage.</span></p>
