 <p><strong>Chapter 399 - Preparations</strong></p>
 <p>During the next three days, the Divine Spiritual City grew increasingly lively and noisy, since more and more people were streaming in from all directions, before congregating in the somewhat ancient city in the middle. Within a moment’s time, like rising clouds and scudding clouds, this place had truly become the most eye-catching place within the entire Northern Heavens Continent.</p>
 <p>Within the tall pavilion located in the city, Mu Chen looking at the figures hiding the skies and covering the earth as they streaked across the city skies akin to rays of light. Unable to help it, he started to smack his lips. During the span of these three days, he had finally recognized the lure and enticement of the “Divine Spiritual Mountain”. According his estimates, all of the small and and big influences within the Northern Heavens Continent should have rushed over to get their share of this liveliness.</p>
 <p>“There’s really a great amount of people here!” said Mu Chen with a smile. Compared to the events he had experienced in the White Dragon City, Western Desolated City and others, they were truly dwarfed by the scale of the occasion caused by the Divine Spiritual Mountain. As for the Northern Spiritual Realm, there simply wasn’t any possibility of such things happening. Within that place, even a person with the strength of an ordinary Heavenly Fusion would already be deemed as an Overlord. However, at this place, a person of that strength would only be considered as an ‘average’ person.</p>
 <p>This kind of disparity caused Mu Chen to give a helpless laugh in response; after all, the Northern Spiritual Realm was just a small place. As for the aspect of cultivation, the requirement for recourse was rather severe and harsh. Therefore, in this small place, where a rank 3 Spiritual Array wasn’t even able to be arranged, even if one was to try their utmost, they might not have that many accomplishments and achievements in it. Naturally, that small place was the birthplace of Mu Chen, with the feelings he had for it were something that couldn’t be replicated.</p>
 <p>There were times where Mu Chen had thoughts of him returning the the Northern Spiritual Realm with his current strength. If he did, his dad, Uncle Zhou, and the rest might be scared shitless of his Heavenly Completion Stage strength. Let’s not talk about the small and tiny Northern Spiritual Realm. Even within the Northern Heavens Continent, he could be considered as a First-class expert. Wanting to be the ruler of a city was something that absolutely couldn’t be anymore simpler.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was just some of his whimsical thoughts, since he knew that his path to being an unrivalled expert had just started. He had promised his dad to bring his mom home, and, as of now, he was way too far from that step. Nonetheless, regardless of the difficulties he faced along the way, he would always work hard to achieve his goal. He wasn’t being conceited about his strength and growth when he said those words when he left. To his dad, this might just be a promise. However, Mu Chen knew that his dad, who had painstakingly brought him up, really missed his mum to the point where his figure appeared somewhat lonely and desolate. This was especially present when he had left his dad. Nevertheless, his dad knew that he, himself, didn’t have such strength to bring his wife back. Thus, he had placed all of his hopes and the painstaking effort on his son, someone that he could feel pride from.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Mu Chen didn’t want his dad to feel any disappointment in him anymore.</p>
 <p>Facing the sun, Mu Chen gave a faint smile. Old man, the current me’s working hard. Let me help you accomplishment the matter you can’t do, alright?</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow’s the opening day for the Divine Spiritual Mountain.”</p>
 <p>All of the sudden, a beautiful-sounding girl’s voice rang out from behind. Panning his head around, he spotted Luo Li present behind him. Sending a faint smile over, he nodded his head in agreement, before turning to look in the far distance past the city. At that place, the Spiritual Qi of the world was growing increasingly erratic as waves of it started to radiate out. Like waves on a sea, crashing sounds resounded from their movements.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the lofty and majestic mountain that was radiating with hair-raisingly rampaging Spiritual Energy seemed to gradually started to become clearer and clearer.</p>
 <p>This was the sign of the impending opening of the Divine Spiritual Mountain.</p>
 <p>“For the past two days, I’ve sought out Senior Sister Xia about the Divine Spiritual Mountain happening this time. There might be six people that you’ll have to pay attention to. These six can be considered as elites at the highest peak within the younger generations of the Northern Heavens Continent. All of them are extremely strong, and I’m afraid that even Mo Longzi might not be able to match up to them,” said Luo Li with a slight frown.</p>
 <p>‘Oh? Which six?”</p>
 <p>“The first one’s, naturally, the Demonic Dragon Palace’s Mo Xingtian. He can be said to be your greatest enemy this time. Since the Demonic Dragon Palace’s treasure is in your hands, they’ll definitely attempt to snatch it back from you. Within the Divine Spiritual Mountain, there’s no way to investigate and blame anyone for any injury or death. Therefore, Mo Xingtian will definitely take action towards you in there,” said Luo Li with a solemn expression on her face. “Also, according to Senior Sister Xia’s reports, it’s estimated that Mo Xingtian’s strength should be after the First Tribulation of the “Three Sovereign Disasters”, the Human Body Disaster.”</p>
 <p>“He has passed the Human Body Disaster, huh…?”</p>
 <p>Faintly nodding his head, Mu Chen’s gaze started to grow slightly sharp and astute at this moment.</p>
 <p>“The next few ones are the young masters of the Umbra Chamber and Commerce, Liu Ying, Heavenly Yuan Chamber of Commerce, Dong Yuan and the Mysterious Yin Mountain’s Zhou Xuan. As for the Western Extreme Palace’s Xi Qinghai, we’ve already met that person once, when we were at the Western Desolated City. He was observing us and Mo Longzi for the entire duration of our fight. In addition, there’s also the Heavenly Cauldron’s Divine Sect’s Su Buxiu.”</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that all of these people might already possess the strength of one who has passed the First Tribulation. Each of them are top-level geniuses raised painstakingly with unlimited resources and time by those peak influences of the Northern Heavens Continent. You can consider them as future in-charges of Chambers of Commerce and sects. If you are to bump into them in the Divine Spiritual Mountain, you can consider them as your enemies.”</p>
 <p>With a faint laugh, Luo Li continued talking, “Naturally, Senior Sister Xia’s not weaker than them. However, compared to other people, the chances of her targeting you are slim.”</p>
 <p>。</p>
 <p>“All of them are vicious characters, huh?” said Mu Chen while nodding his head. <em>So, these are the strengths of the highest elites in the younger generations of the Northern Heavens Continent, huh? Look’s like I can’t underestimate them.</em></p>
 <p>“There shouldn’t be a problem, right?” asked Luo Li, while shooting a look at Mu Chen. Slightly wrinkling her forehead, Luo Li said, “They should have allowed me to participate, hmph.”</p>
 <p>Clearly, those earlier little scuffles and conflicts weren’t comparable to the fights that were about to happen within the Divine Spiritual Mountain. Furthermore, there wouldn’t be any mercy shown by the participants inside it. If one let’s down one’s guard for just the slightest moment, there would be a high possibility for one to not walk out from the Divine Spiritual Mountain alive. Luo Li was clearly feeling worried about this, regardless of her trust in Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>“There’s only one quota! I can’t bear to let you face those cruel and vicious fellows by yourself!” replied Mu Chen with a smile. “Rest assured. Although the opponents are very strong, I’m not that weak. Later, let me see exactly what that Divine Spiritual Mountain has. If I’m able to bring it out, I’ll make sure to get one for you.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words from Mu Chen, Luo Li rolled her eyes towards Mu Chen, before saying, “I’ve heard from Senior Sister Xia that there’s only an extremely small number of people that can receive the Divine Spiritual Baptism every time, due to the handful of people that can enter within the area of baptism. If you still dare to bring it out, I think that you’ll get assaulted by the masses then.”</p>
 <p>A smile surfaced on Mu Chen’s face as he heard her reply, with no refute coming from him.</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s right.”</p>
 <p>As though thinking about something, with a wave of her jade-like arm, numerous clumps of fire surfaced around Luo Li, before floating before her. What appeared were five clear palm-sized transparent jade bottles. Within those bottles were burning flames that were filled to the brim. Those flames were scarlet-red in colour, while radiating with high temperatures. Clearly those jade bottles were made of some special material, since no matter how high those flames burnt, they were unable to shatter their containers apart.</p>
 <p>“These are the things that you’ve asked Senior Sister Xia to obtain for you. It’s said that the flames within these bottles are the product of a Raging Flame Sparrow devouring the geocentric lava, and possess quite strong destructive powers. The flames within these five small jade bottles required seemingly hundreds of Raging Flame Sparrows just to fill them up,” said Luo Li while shooting a doubtful look at Mu Chen. Clearly, she didn’t understand the goal of him suddenly wanting to collect them. Although these things might be able have an effect of catching an opponent off-guard during a fight, they weren’t particularly strong.</p>
 <p>“I have a wonderful use for them.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the five jade bottles, a flash of happiness appeared within Mu Chen’s eyes. Carefully storing them, he said, “Look’s like I owe Senior Sister Xia a favor now.”</p>
 <p>These things were clearly not cheap, and were extremely difficult to collect. It was all thanks to Xia Youran being the eldest Young Mistress of the Nine Summers Chamber of Commerce. If not, he would really have no way of obtaining them within such a short amount of time.</p>
 <p>“It should be due to Elder Sister Ling Xi,” said Luo Li with a faint smile. Xia Youran was extremely close to Elder Sister Ling Xi. After seeing the latter’s attitude to Mu Chen, she had clearly held Mu Chen with much more regard. Due to that, Mu Chen’s request was able to be ranked so highly within her mind.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head, not caring anymore about the relationship between Xia Youran and Ling Xi. With these things, he had now one more hidden card up his sleeves. When the moment comes, it should be quite a handful for even Mo Xingtian to deal with them.</p>
 <p>“Since everything’s set, what’s next…”</p>
 <p>Giving a lazy stretch, Mu Chen gazed towards the mountainous silhouette faintly discernable within the blowing Spiritual Energy in the far distance, before giving a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“…Is to wait for the opening of the Divine Spiritual Mountain.”</p>
 <p>The next day, as the early morning came, the atmosphere of the Divine Spiritual City had completely erupted, with countless shadows shooting towards the skies like a swarm of locusts. From the mountain peaks and plains surrounding the city, one could see figures endlessly taking for the skies, transforming into streaks of light, howling across the horizon.</p>
 <p>The enticement of the Divine Spiritual Baptism was too strong, with countless people already having bloodshot eyes towards it’s lure. Therefore, even those peak influences and powers weren’t able to dominate over the entirety of the Divine Spiritual Mountain by themselves, since they would truly become the enemy of the masses. This was something that even the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy and the always overbearing Demonic Dragon Palace weren’t able to bear, since the price of that would be too high for them to endure.</p>
 <p>Therefore, as long as one had the strength and didn’t exceed the limits, anyone within the Northern Heavens Continent possessed the qualifications to participate in the Divine Spiritual Mountain. Hence, it had led to the spectacular appearance and attendance of this occasion.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s group had also made their move. Under the lead of Dean Tai Cang, they arrived at the front of the vast and boundless Spiritual Energy waves. At this moment, the earth and the skies were already covered by a sea of humans. Nevertheless, only those peak influences of the Northern Heavens Continent possessed the qualifications to vie for the positions right at the very front of the human crowd.</p>
 <p>The arrival of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had attracted the attention of the masses. After all, within the Northern Heavens Continent, there was no one that would dare to show contempt for such a true leviathan.</p>
 <p>Sending a smile only towards some of the people familiar to him, Dean Tai Cang proceeded to place his hands behind his back, sending a deep gaze towards the lofty and majestic mountainous form present behind those Spiritual Energy waves that isolated in another space.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mu Chen had his eyes towards a place not far away, where those from the Demonic Dragon Palace were. With the Black Dragon Sovereign standing at the front, presently behind him was the hemp-clothed, extremely ordinary-looking Mo Xingtian. If not for that deadpanned gaze that gave everyone a profound impression, it would be extremely hard to recognise him if he was placed within a crowd of people. However, this ordinary-looking fellow was genuinely the most vicious person within the younger generations in the Northern Heavens Continent.</p>
 <p>Sensing Mu Chen’s gaze, Mo Xingtian panned his head over, sending a cold and detached smile back towards Mu Chen. Although there wasn’t any killing intent present within his smile, Mu Chen knew that this Mo Xingtian might have already included him within his ‘Must Kill’ list.</p>
 <p>“The second place on the bounty list has already been dealt with. All that’s left is you.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen muttered to himself, before raising his head up. Looking towards the vast and boundless Spiritual Energy waves before him, intense fluctuations started to appear within them. At this moment, the lofty and majestic mountainous form hidden in the depths grew increasingly clear and distinct, while ripples started to undulate from the space before everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s gaze started to churn and flare up.</p>
 <p>The Divine Spiritual Mountain was about to start!</p>
