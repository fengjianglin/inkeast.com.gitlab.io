 <p><strong>Chapter 417 - All Methods</strong></p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Grasping the black heavy spear, Mo Xingtian’s frail-looking figure instantly erupted with a terrifyingly imposing aura. Dark rays of brilliance shown on the surface of the black heavy spear, appearing as if it wanted to transform into a demonic dragon and take to the skies, smashing and shaking the heavens as it did so, causing people to be overwhelmed with shock.</p>
 <p>Staring towards the black heavy spear in Mo Xingtian’s hand, Mu Chen’s eyes had also started to narrow. Clearly, he could sense how extraordinary the black heavy spear was. It was definitely an extremely powerful Spiritual Weapon, and from the looks of it, there’s an extremely high possibly for it to have reached the level of a Peerless Rank Spiritual Artifact. Such a weapon of this grade would be extremely rarely seen, even in an elite influence like the Demonic Dragon Palace. <em>From the looks of it, Mo Xingtian really had invested quite heavily just to kill me today.</em></p>
 <p>“I’d originally assumed that I’d be able to settle you with ease. However, it looks like I was wrong about this. However, it’s also all-good this way. It has already been a very long while since I’ve used the ‘Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear’. I hope that you’ll be able to give it a delightful time today.” Staring towards Mu Chen, Mo Xingtian spoke out with his hoarse voice.</p>
 <p>“I’ll not disappoint you!”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen gave a hearty chuckle in reply, his laughter resounded out like thunder. However, there wasn’t the slightest bit of smiling intent within those scarlet-red eyes of his, with them being filled to the brim with chilling intent. As his laughter reverberated around, he took a stride forward, while a giant dragon shadow surfaced below his feet. With a swish, it split apart the air before it, appearing right before Mo Xingtian in the next instant. Swing his hands down while in a hugging posture, the remnant shadows of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar appeared in the air as it was violently swung down.</p>
 <p>As the remnant shadows enveloped Mo Xingtian, the ground below him started to sink down a level.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Mo Xingtian looked towards the demonic pillar howling down towards him. Giving a furious clench of the heavy spear in his hand, he strode forward, before shooting up into the sky.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>Striding up into the sky, Mo Xingtian sent his spear stabbing forward and swept it out like a rainbow. Akin to a demonic dragon roaring and howling as it shot through the skies, the spear heavily pierced towards the black demonic pillar.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Clear metallic ringing sounds resounded as shock waves visible to the naked-eye rippled out throughout the skies. However, this time, Mo Xingtian did not end up in the miserable state he was in before. Tapping the air with the tip of his feet, he dispelled the frightening energy that was feedbacked into his spear. Looking towards Mu Chen with his deadpan eyes, his hoarse voice rang out, “So, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar can only show such little might in your hands, huh?”</p>
 <p>Remaining emotionless towards Mo Xingtian’s words, Mu Chen took a step forward, with the Great Meru Demonic Pillar instantly rushing towards the sky. As its ominous aura rippled out and blotted the skies, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar started to drastically increase in size. In the short span of a few breaths, it had already grown to over 300 metres in size. Extending his hands out and giving the air before him a hug, as if he was hugging the demonic pillar, Mu Chen gave a ferocious downwards swing.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Warps and distortions instantly appeared in the surrounding space as the air within a 3 kilometre radius around him completely exploded apart, causing this entire zone to turn into a vacuum.</p>
 <p>“Devouring Dragon!”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the demonic spear in Mo Xingtian’s hand shook, before black rays of brilliance blossomed from it, blotting the skies. In the next instant, it shot out of Mo Xingtian’s hands. As a dragon’s roar resounded, black rays of light surrounded it, unexpectedly transforming into a gigantic demonic dragon thousands of metres long, squirming and snaking around as it hovered in the air. As the demonic dragon floated in the sky, it appeared to shroud over the entire region.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>As the demonic dragon roared, it extended its 300 metre long dragon claws out, grasping towards the demonic pillar that was howling down on it. Surging with frightening power, its gigantic dragon tail violently swung towards the Great Meru Demonic Pillar.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>The two gigantic objects smashed against each other with frightening might, causing astonishing energy shock waves to ripple out. Even the surrounding space showed signs of collapsing, indicative of the astonishingly-frightening power of the impact.</p>
 <p>This was the showdown between the ominous weapon of the ancient antiquity and the Peerless Rank Spiritual Artifact!</p>
 <p>However, the ominous weapon of ancient antiquity was now in a seal state. In contrast to it, the Peerless Rank Spiritual Artifact was now erupting with astonishing might in Mo Xingtian’s hands.</p>
 <p>As they raised their heads to look at the world-shaking fight happening in the air, the eyes of the countless experts were filled with astonishment and admiration. At this moment, anyone would be able to see that the two people duking it out in the sky were venting all of their murderous auras out. Every single move they made were all killing blows, clearly meant to reap and steal away each other’s life.</p>
 <p>However, after turning around to think about the grudges and grievances between the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy and the Demonic Dragon Palace, all of them felt that it was completely understandable. They were already sworn enemies at the very beginning. It would be idiotic for any one of them to stay their hand in this confrontation.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Being a Peerless Rank Spiritual Artifact, the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear clearly possessed a level of sentience. It would be able to automatically hone in on Mo Xingtian’s target once he gives his orders to do it. However, being an ominous weapon from the ancient antiquity, the might and prestige of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar was comparable to that of a Divine Weapon. If not for it being in a sealed state, it would be able to shatter the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear in a single strike. Therefore, seemingly being stimulated by the attacks from the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar appeared to have become angry, since fiendish energies surged and gushed out of it, violently slamming against the demonic dragon formed by the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear.</p>
 <p>Under the attacks from the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, the gigantic demonic dragon started to howl in pain. Regardless of its state, a starved camel was bigger than a horse. Even though it was sealed up, the might of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar far exceeded anything that a Peerless Rank Spiritual Artifact could compare to. Therefore, in such a head-on collision of might, the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear was gradually forced into a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>Raising his head to look towards the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear, which was gradually being forced into a disadvantageous position, not a single fluctuation was present in Mo Xingtian’s deadpan eyes. Turning around to look at Mu Chen, a faint smile appeared on his face as he said, “Now, without the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, what are you going to bring out to contend against me?”</p>
 <p>He had sacrificed the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear up just for the sake of entangling and holding the Great Meru Demonic Pillar back. Without this frighteningly ominous weapon, the dread Mo Xingtian had towards Mu Chen would clearly decrease by a great amount.</p>
 <p>Perhaps the Devouring Dragon Demonic Spear would not be able to constrain the Great Meru Demonic Pillar for long. However, this period of time would be more than sufficient for him to get rid of Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>Just as his words rang out, Mo Xingtian had already transformed into a wisp of black smoke, shooting straight towards Mu Chen like a spectre.</p>
 <p>Upon noticing this, Mu Chen’s eyes instantly narrowed. With a shift of his body, a dragon shadow surfaced below his feet as he abruptly retreated back.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that you’re unable to escape from me using this level of the Dragon Soaring Technique,” said Mo Xingtian with a cold smile. Taking a step forward, his figure instantly appeared to have turned somewhat illusory. In the next moment, with a shiver, he completely disappeared from Mu Chen’s view.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Mu Chen’s pupils instantly contracted.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The glow of black lightning instantly erupted from Mu Chen’s body. As lightning arced and danced around his body, two lightning runes surfaced on his chest. His Thunder God Physique was instantly activated.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At the very instant when Mu Chen had activated his Thunder God Physique, a palm, appearing to have passed through the void, brought about torrential Spiritual Energy as it heavily slammed towards Mu Chen’s back without the slightest bit of restraint.</p>
 <p>Not turning his body around, Mu Chen similarly sent a palm slamming towards his back.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The two palms smashed into one another, causing frightening shock waves to sweep out from the point of impact.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was sent flying forward, with a sliver of blood seeping out from the corner of his mouth. In this head-on confrontation with Mo Xingtian, he was able to feel how powerful the latter was. The boundless Spiritual Energy the latter possessed was akin to a large ocean, one that seemed to have no boundaries. Furthermore, Mo Xingtian’s Spiritual Energy was clearly more pure and power than any other ordinary Spiritual Energy.</p>
 <p>This was due to him having attempted to pass through his Spiritual Energy Tribulation.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen flew forward, a chilling expression had appeared within his eyes. Without the slightest hesitation and ignoring the waves of pain coming from his arm, he furiously brought his hands together as boundless Spiritual Energy gushed out from his body.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, a stretch of starry skies surfaced once again behind his back as four gigantic beastial shadows rapidly condensed within it.</p>
 <p>Being just a Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase, even with the supplementation of the fiendish energies from the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, he would not be able to overturn the disadvantageous position in a head-on confrontation with Mo Xingtian. Therefore, he needed to rely on the power of his Divine Arts if he wanted to obtain victory.</p>
 <p>“This move again?”</p>
 <p>Looking towards the starry skies that had formed behind Mu Chen’s back, Mo Xingtian gave a cold sneer as he said, “Although this move might have some use against Liu Ying, I’m afraid that it’s useless against me.”</p>
 <p>Remaining as emotionless as before, Mu Chen ignored Mo Xingtian’s taunting as he changed his hand seals.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>As roars started to resound, four gigantic beastial shadows abruptly shot out from within the starry skies, before rushing straight towards Mo Xingtian.</p>
 <p>Seeing them heading towards him, Mo Xingtian shook his head apathetically as Spiritual Energy surged out from his body, blotting the skies. Akin to a stretch of ocean, it appeared vast and powerful, bringing along a power that could crush hills and sunder mountains.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s gaze grew even more frosty as an extremely completely and foreign-looking seal was formed with his hands.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, the four beastial shadows raised their heads and raored towards the skies, while rays of brilliance blossomed from within their bodies. As those rays of light came together, they appeared to have transformed into a giant 3000 metre large glowing seal. Within the seal, the azure dragon, white tiger, vermillion bird and the black tortoise all occupied its four corners, while Spiritual Energy gushed out with the might of an ocean, appearing as if it was trying to seal up the heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>“Four Gods Constellation Technique, the Four Gods Heavenly Sealing Imprint!”</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>Humming sounds erupted from the gigantic imprint as it transformed into a ray of light, covering the earth and hiding the skies as it pressed down from above. As it did so, the Spiritual Energy present in this region had all been forced away by its might.</p>
 <p>As the divine imprint came pressing down from above, the faces of Xia Youran and the others started to quietly change. These changes were especially present on the face of Liu Ying, as shock appeared within his eyes, before he subsequently clenched and grounded his teeth. <em>Exactly how many cards does this brat have in hiding!</em></p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Under the envelope of the divine imprint, the torrential Spiritual Energy pouring out from Mo Xingtian’s body was completely suppressed and scattered. The radiance blossoming out from him was weakened under the might of the divine imprint, as if it had been sealed and brought under restraint.</p>
 <p>Raising his head to look towards the divine imprint pressing down towards him, as well as his Spiritual Energy, which was rapidly being dissipated, fluctuations of a serious expression finally surfaced within those deadpan eyes of his. In the next moment, it seemed as if he had given a gentle sigh, and yet, his sigh was still brimming with killing intent.</p>
 <p>“You’re actually able to achieve such strength while only being at the Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase… That’s why the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy would hold you in such high regard…”</p>
 <p>“If you’ve ignored this event and continued to cultivate, I’m afraid that before a year’s up, there’d be no one in the younger generation of the Northern Heavens Continent that would be able to contend against you…”</p>
 <p>“However… you might not have such an opportunity anymore…”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, dark-red blood started flowing out from Mo Xingtian’s fingertip as he gave a gentle tap on his forehead. As the fresh blood flowed down, it started to crawl, sliver by sliver, into his deadpan eyes. In the next moment, a mysterious and malevolent-looking blood rune started to condense from the blood flowing down his face.</p>
 <p>Looking at the strange actions made by Mo Xingtian, Xia Youran and the others gawked before their faces turned deathly pale in the next moment.</p>
 <p>“That’s the…Dragon Murdering Demonic Rune?”</p>
