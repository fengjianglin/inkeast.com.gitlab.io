The roar made even the sky tremble in that instant.</span></p>

At this instant, he finally understood what was going on. The divine wheel that Mu Chen had used wasn’t his final move. The true ultimate technique was the lightning that was hidden behind the divine wheel.</span></p>

When he was drawing in the boiling Spiritual Energy between this heaven and earth, he secretly covered up this ultimate technique of his.</span></p>

The previous attack was already so frightening. However, Mu Chen was not complacent by it and had hidden a bigger ultimate technique behind his first…</span></p>

When everyone raised their heads, the black lightning looked as if it was conducting lightning judgment as the colossal black lightning fell.</span></p>

In the places that the lightning had swept past, space was distorted and looked like a glass that was about to shatter at any moment.</span></p>

Currently, the amount of Spiritual Energy around Ji Xuan was frozen still. Because he had to defend himself against the Divine Wheel of the Heavenly Wood from Mu Chen earlier, he had to circulate the Spiritual Energy within his body, which caused it to be sluggish for an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, when Mu Chen’s attack came, it was the exact moment that the Spiritual Energy within Ji Xuan’s body was unable to restore back to its peak.</span></p>

After dominating the Numero Uno slot for so long and having not been defeated before, was he going to lose today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faced with the attack that Mu Chen had perfectly grasped the chance to use, even someone like Ji Xuan had to be defeated, right?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black pillar of lightning fell from the sky as if it was a pillar that could prop up the sky as it pierced the heavens and earth. It could clearly be seen from anywhere within a fifty-meter radius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liiiiiiiii!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That cry was extremely ancient, with an indescribable ferocity. As if a primordial beast was waking up.</span></p>

Sound waves that could be seen with the naked-eye swept out, causing the surrounding space of a few hundred meters to have traces of distortion and was twisting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure trembled as he flew away. His feet were sliding on the sky for a thousand meters before he was able to stabilize himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he managed to stabilize his figure, his facial expression was heavy. His eyes were fixed on the black lightning. Clearly, the fearsome cry originated from that location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that…?” Mu Chen’s brows were furrowed as his palm lightly touched the Mustard Seed Bracelet. When the primordial cry rang out, he sensed that the black egg that was the Nine Netherbird had jolted a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the eyes in this region were looking at the black pillar of lightning. Evidently, the bizarre change-of-event earlier had attracted their attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes, the black pillar slowly dissipated as the lightning scattered. We the lightning pillar started to dissipate, a human figure that was faintly discernible appeared in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone widened their eyes in that instant, whereas Mu Chen’s eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lightning dissipated as Ji Xuan’s figure appeared before everyone’s eyes. However, going against everyone’s expectations, there wasn’t any injury on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His current state was the same as before, not even his skin was charred by the lightning. Under that fearful attack, he was actually unharmed!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faced against Mu Chen’s attack that was unleashed at a perfect timing, even a Third Grade Spirit Disaster would have to pay the price from it. But, right now, how was Ji Xuan still fine?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li’s curved eyebrows slightly knitted together as she became submerged in her thoughts. Thereafter, she gave a glance at Wen Qingxuan and saw the smear of shock that flashed through the latter’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That primordial cry from before…” Luo Li said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems to be similar to the super Spiritual Beast Ranked 8th on the Myriad Beast Record, the Primordial Skydragon Hawk…” Wen Qingxuan lightly nodded her head as she continued, “But I have no idea how Ji Xuan was able to unleash that cry. Did he have any treasures in his possession that were linked to the Primordial Skydragon Hawk?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li faintly shook her head. Ji Xuan was indeed, someone hard to deal with. She originally thought that Mu Chen’s plan was perfect, but who could have expected that it was countered at the crucial time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An uproar exploded in this region. Everyone was startled by the fact that Ji Xuan was unharmed. At the same time, they could not help feeling respect in their hearts. This fellow that was the Numero Uno of the point rankings was indeed, too ferocious to the point that even such an attack could not do anything against him. In the entire Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, who else could rival him?</span></p>

There wasn’t any expression on his face. His attack that should have guaranteed his victory was actually mysteriously countered. This made the degree of danger he had for Ji Xuan in his heart rise.</span></p>
