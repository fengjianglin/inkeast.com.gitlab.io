That surprise naturally came from the great improvement of his will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, his will should’ve been extremely weak now that he had split it into two. But the reality had given him a surprise. Compared to a month ago, not only was his will not weakened, it had grown stronger instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like one month of visualising the lightning prison has given a great boost to my will.” Mu Chen muttered to himself and his eyes couldn’t help lighting up. He finally understood the great benefit of a will’s cultivation technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Mu Chen had no ways of improving his will and could only rely on some opportunities to strengthen it. Furthermore, those increments weren’t obvious. But adding them up bit by bit, his will had gradually surpassed an ordinary person’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, after obtaining the Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique, he had only cultivated it for a month and the improvement of his will was comparable to the past year…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s no wonder why it’s so hard to become a Battle Formation Master. It’s practically impossible to form a Spirit of Battle Will with over ten thousand runes without any cultivation method.” Mu Chen sighed as he shook his head. After all, even if his will was powerful in the future, he was still trapped before ten thousand runes, not to mention about him intending to become a Battle Formation Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the path of a Battle Formation Master, getting through the foothold was the hardest part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now that I have visualised the lightning prison, I have barely succeeded in the Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique. In the future, I only have to refine my will to attract the lightning tribulation. As long as I manage to get through the first tribulation, there will be a great boost to my will… at that time, not to mention a ten thousand rune Battle Will Spirit, even fifty thousand runes might be possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As thoughts revolved in Mu Chen’s heart, just thinking about that day left him with expectations. A ten thousand rune Battle Will Spirit alone was invincible under the Seventh Grade Sovereign Realm. If he managed to reach over thirty thousand runes, perhaps even a Seventh Grade Sovereign would be fearful of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Mu Chen knew that he probably still had a long refining process to go before he experienced the first tribulation. However, the hardest portion, which was stepping into the foothold, was done, so it was practically a matter of time for him to get through his tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Becoming a Battle Formation Master had made Mu Chen more confident. Not only was he a Battle Formation Master, he was also a Spiritual Array Master. The two originated from the same place in the ancient times, so there was no lack of people that cultivated the two of them in the past. Those existences were extremely dazzling, even during the ancient times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>

With a slight will of his mind, he raised his head and looked up at the sky of the Sovereign Sea, seeing the black pagoda that quietly stood before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden flames were ablaze within it as it refined the azure smoke that had endlessly entered the pagoda and a Spiritual Energy current was pouring down from the pagoda, rumbling as it entered the endless Sovereign Sea down below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this one month, the Nine-Layered Pagoda had been constantly working to refine the Spiritual Energy essences in the Fallen Origin Pellets. It refined them without knowing tiredness and Mu Chen could sense that compared to a month before, his Spiritual Energy was much more robust. The sea level of the Sovereign Sea had also increased, it became more vast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This level of Spiritual Energy… not far away from the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A light flashed in Mu Chen’s eyes as he sensed the Spiritual Energy in his Sovereign Sea of the Fourth Grade Sovereign Realm, it was just a step away from the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But even if I finish the 20,000 Fallen Origin Pellets, I’m afraid that I still will not be able to make my first attempt at the breakthrough.” Thoughts swiftly revolved in Mu Chen’s mind. Shortly after, with a will of his mind, Mu Chen had exited his cultivative state. His figure, which had not been moving for the past month in the cave, slowly opened its eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dense azure smoke in the cave was much thinner due to being absorbed and refined by Mu Chen. Over the past month, the 20,000 Fallen Origin Pellets had also been gradually devoured by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the thinned azure smoke, then became briefly submerged in his thoughts before patting the Universal Bracelet on his wrist. Instantly, a flowing current whistled out and had spread out within this cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flowing current was an innumerable amount of drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. Judging from the scale, there were at least 100,000 drops. The amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids in his possession was also extremely ample. Even if he had spent quite a bit over the past year, he had still stockpiled a portion for himself to attempt his breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With 100,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, it should be enough for Mu Chen to make a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swiftly formed some seals, then slightly opened his mouth. Instantly, the current of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid whistled as it poured into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky had split open in the Sovereign Sea as numerous drops descended from the sky, before gushing into the Nine-Layered Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

The golden flames were ablaze and refining the large amount of Spiritual Energy before pouring it into the Sovereign Sea, converting it into Mu Chen’s own Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen watched this scene as he sat down on the sky and formed seals with his hands. He circulated the Great Pagoda Art and the Nine-Layered Pagoda violently trembled with numerous dragons endlessly flying from the pagoda…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire Sovereign Sea trembled with buzzing noises as massive Spiritual Energy waves violently rolled on the surface of the sea. Layers of waves overlapped, charging towards the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s as if they were trying to break apart the shackles and reach a higher level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The path of an expert meant fearlessness towards dangers, disregarding themselves to reach a higher point. Only then, could they stand out amongst the countless life forms in the world and become a powerhouse in the Great Thousand World!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Mu Chen started to gather his focus and refined the Fallen Origin Pellets and Sovereign Spiritual Liquids at full force as time gradually passed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

At the same time, streaks of light of the same scale flew over from the distance, which vaguely brought along an ominous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This mountain range was naturally the resting place of the Great Havenlaw Domain. Except that they probably never expected that Mu Chen’s cultivation would last for a month.</span></p>

But fortunately, after their trip from the Death Ruin, they had obtained a sufficient amount of Fallen Origin Pellets. So they did not suffer any great loss over the past month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, when Mu Chen was cultivating, the Kings had also occasionally left this place to look for some ruins to kill their boredom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they swept the ruins, they had also paid attention to the information in the Fallen Battlefield. Clearly, as time passed, the brutality of this Hunting War had gradually been unfolded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the past month, there were countless brutal battles that took place in the Fallen Battlefield. Those forces that were rather weak were either annihilated or they had left the Fallen Battlefield, this brutal land, after suffering heavy casualties.</span></p>

Her gaze was fixed on a mountain peak not too far away, it was the tightly shut cave where Mu Chen was cultivating.</span></p>

If it wasn’t for them being able to vaguely sense the undulations of Spiritual Energy within, they might have thought that something went wrong with Mu Chen’s cultivation.</span></p>

If it wasn’t for their ample harvest from the Death Ruin, they would’ve been left behind from this one month of waiting alone.</span></p>

They looked at Mu Chen’s seclusion location and furrowed their brows. “King Mu still show no signs of coming out?”</span></p>

Clearly, Mu Chen’s cultivation time had somewhat exceeded their expectations.</span></p>

Cultivating for so long, he must have a pretty great harvest. Looks like after this seclusion, King Mu’s strength will undergo a great boost.” The Blood Hawk King, on the other hand, had casually smiled.</span></p>

But if we encountered the Divine Pavilion, which is a little ferocious at this point in time, it’d be somewhat troublesome.” The Spiritual Sword King said.</span></p>

Half a month ago, the Divine Pavilion ran into the Myriad Saint Peak, which was also a peak force. In order to snatch a Grade-1 Ruin, both sides fought and the outcome had left everyone shocked.</span></p>

Not only was he heavily wounded, but half of his elite troops had also fallen in the battle. They also had Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm experts dying from the battle, it was a tragic battle…</span></p>

It was so much so that even Fang Yi, who was the Overlord of the Dragon-Phoenix Record, was pale in comparison.</span></p>

If that wasn’t the case, then she wouldn’t have been able to defeat a Battle Will genius so easily.&nbsp;</span></p>

Facing a Battle Formation Master who was in control of an elite troop, even those with pinnacle Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm strength would be extremely fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s said that Fang Yi has been searching for our traces. It looks like they’re going to take revenge for the previous grudge. We have to stay low-key for the time being.” Nine Nether said gently, “We only have to wait until Mu Chen is out and we can move out to join up with the others and wait for the Domain Ruler’s order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King and the rest nodded their heads. Indeed, with the Divine Pavilion’s current momentum becoming more ferocious, in addition to Zhantai Liuli, who had become a Battle Formation Master, they probably could only wait until Mu Chen was out before they should confront them.</span></p>
