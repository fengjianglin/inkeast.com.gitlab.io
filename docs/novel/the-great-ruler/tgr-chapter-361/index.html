 <p><strong>Chapter 361 - Chi Yu and Mao Jiang</strong></p>
 <p>When the spatial fluctuations erupted out, Mu Chen was to first to react. Spiritual Energy erupted from his body, immediately protecting him and Luo Li, whom was in his bosom. However, the expected attack didn’t arrive. After lasting for a few breaths, the spatial fluctuations completely dissipated.</p>
 <p>Embracing the slender waist of the girl within his bosom, Mu Chen descended on a mountain peak. Their surroundings were still pervaded by the thick spiritual mist. However, there wasn’t any movement coming from it.</p>
 <p>Obviously, they were still within the depths of the Western Desolated Territory. Those spatial fluctuations earlier were only meant to split them apart.</p>
 <p>“Looks like we’ve been discovered long ago,” said Luo Li, her clear and limpid eyes sizing up their surroundings.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head, while his eyes were brimming with vigilance. The unforeseen circumstance that happened had caused him to feel slight uneasy, since he didn’t know the exact motive his enemy had in doing so.</p>
 <p>“The previous spatial fluctuations were too weak, and only would’ve been able to separate us by a huge distance. However, it's already enough to allow our enemies to defeat us one by one,” said Luo Li in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>“Let’s group up with them as fast as possible,” said Mu Chen after frowning and pondering awhile.</p>
 <p>Their mission this time was extremely dangerous. Furthermore, all of them were exposed, while their enemies were hidden. They were even separated by them. To Mu Chen’s group, this was an extremely disadvantageous situation.</p>
 <p>Luo Li faintly nodded. It was fortunate that Mu Chen’s reaction was fast, resulting in the two of them not being separated. If not, she would’ve truly been worried to death.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen proceeded to walk forward, Spiritual Energy burning with black flames started to rise from his body. Walking in front of Luo Li, his gaze vigilantly swept the thick spiritual mist in their surroundings.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>However, just as he had started walking, his eyes furiously contacted. Explosively retreating a number of steps back, a rampaging streak of light suddenly split the thick spiritual mist apart, before shooting towards the position he was in at lightning speed. The ground over there instantly collapsed as cracks extended from there.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen looked towards his front, he saw a black pike that pierced deep into the earth. Only leaving less than half of its body above the ground, it hummed as it intensely vibrated. The strength put into this pike was rather astonishing.</p>
 <p>“Tsk! Tsk!”</p>
 <p>Just as Mu Chen had evaded the sudden black pike attack that had come from nowhere, the thick mist at another position split apart, only to see scarlet streaks of light hiding the skies and covering the earth as they explosively shot over.</p>
 <p>Luo Li strode over, her jade-like hand tightly grasping her longsword. Instantly, Sword Aura swept across horizontally. Dinging sounds rang out as the Sword Aura blocked all of the incoming scarlet streaks of light.</p>
 <p>“Clap! Clap!”</p>
 <p>Clapping sounds seemed to ring out from the thick mist. His gaze turning frosty, Mu Chen stared at the location where the scarlet streaks of light had appeared. As the thick mist slowly parted, bit by bit, two figures slowly appeared within his line-of-sight.</p>
 <p>In front of him was a giant towering cliff with two figures, one sitting and one standing, at its peak. The person sitting was dressed in scarlet robes, while a malevolent scar was present on his face. Roughly ten scarlet rays of light were floating within his palms at this moment. They were fiery red daggers, twisting and twining above his palms akin to swimming fish.</p>
 <p>As for the person standing, it was an extremely skinny male. However, although he was small in size, eight large black pikes were carried on his back. They were even taller than him, which gave people a strange impact to their sight upon seeing him.</p>
 <p>At this moment, these two people were sending a smile filled with amusement as they stared at Mu Chen and Luo Li.</p>
 <p>“Aiyahyah, our luck truly is great. We’re actually able to meet a girl of such quality…” the eyes of the scarlet-robed male swept across Mu Chen and Luo Li, before finally resting on Luo Li’s body. Instantly, his eyes lit up, before speaking out in a grin.</p>
 <p>“The faces of these two people seem very…could it be that they’re Freshmen? Haha, looks like the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy truly is in a tough spot now! They’ve actually dared to even send such a squad out,” said the thin male while licking his lips.</p>
 <p>“Exactly. They even dared to send Heavenly Transformation Stage students…the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy is truly getting more and more useless,” said the male in scarlet robes as he shot a weird look at Mu Chen. <em>Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase? He dared to come rescue people with that strength? He truly was trying to seek death.</em></p>
 <p>The male in scarlet robes gave a gentle flick of his finger, causing the ten scarlet rays of light to revolve increasingly fast. Grinning while staring at Mu Chen, he said, “I’ll give you a chance, brat. Just run away, and leave that girl to us. You might have a bit of chance to survive.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen glared at the male in scarlet robes and the thin male. With a voice that was totally devoid of emotion, he replied, “So, you two are the 7th and 8th Rank on the bounty list rankings, Chi Yu and Mao Jiang, huh…?”</p>
 <p>“Looks like the information you have about us isn’t little,” replied the male in scarlet robes by the name of Chi Yu. Extending his hand to grab a dagger, he extended his blood red tongue and gave it a lick, while a baleful aura radiated from his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Okay, brat. Stop talking any more nonsense and quickly scram. This is the first time over these past few years that I’ve seen a girl of such quality…”</p>
 <p>Riiiinng!</p>
 <p>The clear and melodious ring of a sword furiously resounded as an incomparably sharp Sword Aura swept out. With an indescribable speed, it split about the earth, before cleaving down on Chi Yu’s face.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A black pike was furiously thrusted forward, heavily impacting against the Sword Aura. As Spiritual Energy erupted out, the earth was chopped apart, while the black pike was sent shooting backwards.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>Numerous sharp Sword Auras slashed across Chi Yu’s face, bringing about some streaks of blood.</p>
 <p>Chi Yu’s face instantly changed as he explosively retreated. With an incomparably dark look, he glared at the young girl standing beside Mu Chen with a black longsword in her hand, who was staring at him with eyes that seemed to have seen a maggot.</p>
 <p>“Truly delicious.”</p>
 <p>Chi Yu clenched his teeth and wiped away the blood stains on his face as a dark and sinister shadow erupted from his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Leave him to me?” asked Luo Li as she faintly tilted her head over, seeking for Mu Chen’s approval. Towards this disgusting fellow that was staring at her with those unclean eyes, she really wanted to stab her sword into him.</p>
 <p>“Cut off his hands and leave his life,” replied Mu Chen, while gently nodding his head. As he was speaking, Luo Li could hear the thick killing intent present within his words.</p>
 <p>Giving a beautiful and gentle smile that appeared sweet, Luo Li replied, “Ok.”</p>
 <p>“Attack! Kill them both!” Chi Yu roared, his gaze became extremely dark as of now. Of the two people, other than that girl in black, whose strength at Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase, made it harder to be dealt with, that Mu Chen seemed to be a burden.</p>
 <p>Just based on that, and yet they dared to act in such a manner in front of them?!</p>
 <p>A sinister smile appeared at the corner of Mao Jiang’s mouth as he grasped a black pike from his back. With a shiver of his arm, the black pike erupted with a bright and resplendent black light, appearing akin to a black dragon. Splitting apart the air, even the earth started splitting to form a gigantic fissure as it explosively shot towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen took a step forward. Without any intention of retreating, he tightly clenched his fingers. Black lightning encased his body, before furiously sending a fist rumbling out.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Black lightning gushed out as Mu Chen’s fist smashed head-on against the black pike that was shot straight at him.</p>
 <p>“Scram!”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s gaze turned frosty as lightning crazily overflowed from his fist. In the next instant, that black pike was, unexpectedly, repelled by Mu Chen’s fist.</p>
 <p>“What?!”</p>
 <p>The faces of Chi Yu and Mao Jiang seemingly changed at that very instant as shock flashed within their eyes. Even Chi Yu, whose strength was at the Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase, didn’t dare to use his bare fist to smash against Mao Jiang’s pike. However, this brat, whose strength appeared to be at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase, was actually able to accomplish it?</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase. And yet you dare to bounce and jump around here. Seems like you do not know death.”</p>
 <p>Chilling and murderous intent erupted from Mu Chen’s handsome face. With regards to these two rude fellows, Mu Chen would absolutely not let them off today.</p>
 <p>“Swish!”</p>
 <p>As his voice rang out, a dragon’s shadow rose from his body. In the next instant, akin to lightning, he rushed straight towards Mao Jiang.</p>
 <p>“Shameless boasting!”</p>
 <p>Chilling intent appeared in Mao Jiang’s eyes as he, too, shot forward. With a clench of his hands, two black pikes appeared within. Spiritual Energy erupted and swept out as Mao Jiang’s body shook. In the next instant, shadow pikes hid the skies and covered the earth as they shrouded over Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>However, facing this incoming attack, Mu Chen still didn’t show any signs of evading them. Black lightning sparkled on his body, unexpectedly allowing those shadow pikes to violently descend on his body.</p>
 <p>Ding! Ding!</p>
 <p>Metallic sounds rang out as sparks shot out everywhere. However, those shadow pikes were, unexpectedly, unable to cause the slightest bit of harm to Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A fist rumbled out from him, piercing through those shadow pikes. As Spiritual Energy gushed from him, his fist carried along frightening Spiritual Energy fluctuations as it headed straight for Mao Jiang’s chest.</p>
 <p>Mao Jiang was immediately scared shitless by the violent and vicious attack of Mu Chen. Pulling back his two pikes, he placed them in front of his chest, guarding him.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s fist violently slammed against the two pikes. Even though they were made from iron essence, unexpectedly, those two pikes were pressed into extremely eye-catching arcs, and had seemingly stuck to Mao Jiang’s chest.</p>
 <p>A chilling glint flashed within Mu Chen’s eyes. Black lightning erupted from his fist, causing his power to drastically rise.</p>
 <p>Crack!</p>
 <p>The two iron essence pikes had broken completely. Akin to lightning, Mu Chen’s fist violently slammed against Mao Jiang’s chest. The latter instantly sported a mouthful of blood as his body flew back hundreds of metres, before finally stabilising himself miserably.</p>
 <p>While waiting for himself to stabilise, Mao Jiang’s eyes were overwhelmed with shock and horror. He never dreamt that this youth, who appeared to be the easiest to deal with, whose strength was only at Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase, would actually possess such terrifying strength!</p>
 <p>Due to this unforeseen spectacle, even Chi Yu’s face turned grave. Looking at the youth, who was now clad in black lightning, unease had, unknowingly, started to erupt from his heart.</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>As a chilling glint flashed within his eyes, Chi Yu gave a flick of his finger. In the next instant, numerous scarlet rays of light that carried along an extremely sharp Aura explosively stabbed towards Mu Chen’s back at lightning speed.</p>
 <p>However, just as those scarlet rays of light shot out, a slender and beautiful figure appeared behind Mu Chen. Sword Aura swept out, slicing apart all those incoming scarlet rays of light.</p>
 <p>Luo Li stood in the air. A black skirt wrapped her exquisite and lovable figure. Her long hair draped down from her head, appearing as bright and resplendent as a river of silver. However, at this moment, an apathetic light surfaced from those clear, glass-like eyes of hers.</p>
 <p>“Leave your arms behind. If not, I’ll get scolded.” Staring quietly at Chi Yu, the young girl spoke out in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>Clenching and grinding his teeth, Chi Yu replied with a sneer, “Just based on you?”</p>
 <p>The jade-like hand of Luo Li that was tightly grasping the longsword slowly rose into the air. Pointing towards Chi Yu in the distance. An extremely astonishing Sword Aura rushed to the skies. At this moment, the spiritual mist within a radius of a thousand metres was scattered by that Sword Aura.</p>
 <p>“Just based on me.”</p>
 <p>An apathetic smile seemed to surface on her delicate and exquisite face. Within her beauty, faint killing intent flowed out. With a shake of her jade-like hand, boundless Sword Aura condensed into a river of Sword Aura in the air above her head.</p>
 <p>Extremely frightening fluctuations started to radiate from within the river of Sword Aura, causing Chi Yu’s face to slowly turn grim, bit by bit.</p>
 <p>No one could have guessed that the youth and the young girl in front of their eyes, whom appeared to be the easiest to deal with, were actually that troublesome and intractable.</p>
 <p>This time, they truly had kicked an iron board.</p>
