Immediately attracting countless gazes over to the distant sky. The morale of the Kingo Troop and the experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain, whom were low because of their defeats, raised up with spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s the Nine Nether Troop!”</span></p>

In barely half a year, nearly everyone in the Great Havenlaw Domain knew that the Nine Nether Troop was rising at a stunning rate. Likewise, they also knew of Mu Chen, the new Commander that had led the Nine Nether Troop to rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Lin Qingfeng narrowed his eyes as he looked at that direction. The far away thunderclouds swept out along with a dreadful aura as they made their appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a troop donned in black armour with pitch-black Battle Will whistling like torrents. Vaguely, there were violent roars of thunder coming from it as well. The entire troop quietly stood on the sky and the austerity coming from them wasn’t something to belittle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, the Nine Nether Troop of the Nine Nether Palace? I have been hearing about it for a long time.” Lin Qingfeng smiled as he glanced at the black troop before him with his eyes slightly narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have long heard of Myriad Swords Valley’s impressive reputation, as well. Now that I’m seeing it for myself, the rumours aren’t fake.” Mu Chen’s figure flashed out from the Nine Nether Troop as he spoke with a slight smile, while looking at Lin Qingfeng, who was dressed in azure robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be the new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace, Mu Chen, right?” Lin Qingfeng stared at Mu Chen as he slowly continued, “Rumour has it that not only have you defeated the Blood Hawk Troop of your Great Havenlaw Domain, even the Demonic Lightning House of the Demonic Lightning Sect was defeated by your hands?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he cast a glance at the Kingo Troop, whose atmosphere was a little unsettled, “Commander Lin, war is endless right now. Why don’t you leave with your people first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you want to save them?” Lin Qingfeng smiled as he gently flicked the longsword behind him and continued speaking to Mu Chen with an eye-narrowing smile, “It’s fine to save others, but don’t drag yourself in as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Lin Qingfeng had heard of the achievements of the Nine Nether Troop, he clearly didn’t feel that it could threaten him. Regardless of anything, he was the lead Commander of the Myriad Swords Valley. Even in the entire Hundred Battles Domain, the amount of Domain Lords that could be comparable to him could be counted in one hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, not all of the Three Thousand Swordsmen were by his side. It was because he was bold enough to look down on the other Domain Lords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What Commander Lin said is also true.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen nodded his head with smiles on his face. He naturally knew that with Lin Qingfeng’s reputation in the Hundred Battles Domain, wanting to save others by relying on his mouth was impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since words were useless… then they would speak with their fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A chill immediately rose in Mu Chen’s pitch-black eyes, there wasn’t any hesitation as he stomped his feet. The Nine Nether Troop below let out an orderly bark as pitch-black Battle Will soared into the heavens. Amongst the Battle Will, there were actually roars of thunder as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to a month ago, the Battle Will of the current Nine Nether Troop was clearly much stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>

Cries of myriads of swords rang out as the Sword Aura of Battle Will whistled out. It was like a windstorm that revolved around Lin Qingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sharp aura coming from it looked like it could tear the heavens and earth apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Mu Chen, if you want to rescue others, then try taking a move of mine!” Lin Qingfeng laughed, but there wasn’t much of a smiling expression on his face as his hands abruptly joined together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sword Intent - Spiritual Sword Lotus!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boundless Sword Aura swept out and turned into a sword lotus. The sword lotus bloomed and as it revolved, it even left behind fine slicing marks on space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there wasn’t any noise from the sword lotus, anyone could sense the sharpness concealed beneath that silence. Clearly, Lin Qingfeng had no intention of going easy as he had used his strongest move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Qingfeng faintly cast a glance at Mu Chen and flicked his finger. Instantly, the sword lotus flew out, leaving behind afterimages in the sky. The speed was as swift as lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword lotus swiftly expanded in Mu Chen’s eyes, but there wasn’t any alarm on his face. His seals changed, causing the boundless Nine Nether Battle Will to surge out as it formed into a black fist. On the black fist, there were black lightning bolts violently flickering on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Nether Battle Will - Nine Nether Lightning Fist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen threw a fist forth as the black fist that was enveloped in lightning flew out along with his gesture. It did not avoid, but heavily clashed with the sword lotus head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sword Aura and the Battle Will that was flickering in lightning swept out, causing space to be horribly distorted in an instant. The impact swept out as it wreaked havoc. However, the two troops remain unmoved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Down below, there were countless gazes exchanging and it was unavoidable for there to be some shock in their eyes. Anyone could tell that the attack of the Three Thousand Swordsmen could not do a thing to the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Nether Troop seems to be stronger compared to when it fought with the Blood Hawk Troop.” There were experts with keen eyes that immediately realised that the Nine Nether Troop had gotten stronger than when they fought with the Blood Hawk Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Nether Troop has followed the right person. When they were in the hands of Cao Feng, there wasn’t such vigor from them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far in the sky, the Commander of the Kingo Troop, Qian Feng also had a complicated gaze as he looked at Mu Chen, who was facing Lin Qingfeng. Initially, when Mu Chen became the Commander of the Nine Nether Troop, he had also secretly mocked about it because he did not feel that such a young man could have many capabilities. But the series of incidents after that made him come to an understanding that his sight was narrow and shallow. It was in the hands of this young man that the Nine Nether Troop, who didn’t have much reputation before, started to slowly emanate their lustre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so much so that, right now, they already had the strength to confront the Three Thousand Swordsmen of the Myriad Sword Valley, a pretty well-reputable troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander, do we need to help?” Someone asked behind Qian Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qian Feng shook his head. “Lin Qingfeng can’t do anything to Mu Chen. They will not fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his gaze, he could naturally tell that although Lin Qingfeng was formidable, it wouldn’t be easy for him to defeat Mu Chen. Unless the entire troop of the Three Thousand Swordsmen was present here, only then could he suppress Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Qian Feng had expected, Lin Qingfeng slightly knitted his brows upon seeing that the attack that he had launched was blocked by the Nine Nether Troop. In the end, he smiled. “Looks like the rumours aren’t false. Commander Mu Chen is truly not simple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re flattering me.” Mu Chen lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since Commander Mu Chen has come out, I will naturally give you face. Today, I will let the Kingo Troop off. But I hope that when the war begins for our two factions, Commander Mu Chen can still remain so calm.” Lin Qingfeng smiled with his fists cupped together. Thereafter, he waved his hand as he turned around and left with his troops, simple and straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at those silhouettes and frowned his brows. No wonder Lin Qingfeng was the lead Commander of the Myriad Swords Valley. In the short time that they had fought, Mu Chen already knew that he was a thorny problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder the Myriad Swords Valley can become one of the three great forces in the Hundred Battles Domain, they are truly quite capable.” Mu Chen murmured to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like the upcoming decisive battle will be an earth-shaking one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Mu Chen, thanks for the help.” As Mu Chen became sunk in his thoughts, Qian Feng had already approached with the Kingo Troop and thanked with his fists cupped together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Qian Feng is too polite, we’re all from the Great Havenlaw Domain. So it’s natural for us to help each other.” Mu Chen immediately replied with his fists cupped together. The Gild King was very low-profiled in the Great Havenlaw Domain. Although it wouldn’t make them feel deeply grateful from his assistance, it could at least deepen the relationship of the Gild Hall and their Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smear of a smile appeared on Qian Feng’s stern expression as his impression of Mu Chen got better. He had seen many of the so-called “geniuses” but every single one of them was prideful and arrogant. But Mu Chen, who stood before him, did not have that arrogance, it’s no wonder that the Nine Nether King placed him with such regards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since Commander Mu Chen has come, then the Nine Nether King must have come as well, right? Haha, this decisive battle is just waiting for the Nine Nether King.” Qian Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, she has already gone ahead and joined up with the Three Emperors.” Mu Chen nodded his head. Nine Nether was, after all, one of the Nine Kings, belonging to the top power of the Great Havenlaw Domain. So the decisive battle naturally wouldn’t lack her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qian Feng nodded his head. Just when he was about to speak, a deep and low drumbeat resounded from the horizon far away. That drumbeat seemed like it was filled with endless Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s the Hundred Battles Drum of Hundred Battles City!” Qian Feng’s expression turned grave in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong?” Mu Chen immediately asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hundred Battles City will soon open!” Qian Feng said with a solemn voice and continued, “Commander Mu Chen, let us swiftly make our way to the camp!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was briefly stunned. The Hundred Battles Domain was actually in such a rush to start the decisive battle? But he didn’t have much time to think about it right now. He waved his hand and flew out with Qian Feng with the two troops closely following behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two steaks swiftly flew across the horizon like lightning as the ancient drum noises got even clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They flew at top speed for half an hour, before Mu Chen and Qian Feng’s figures gradually slowed down. They cast their glances far away as the light screen that was enveloping Hundred Battles City was slowly being torn apart. Immediately, there were an earth-shattering amount of figures sweeping out like locusts, covering the sky of the Hundred Battles City to the point that not even sunlight could shine past them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ahead of this terrifying formation was also being filled with a multitude of people, stretching to the end of one’s sight as countless powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations soared into the horizon. The violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations practically caused the Spiritual Energy in the heavens and earth to boil up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two terrifying formations were facing each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky looked as if it was about to crumble at this instance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help spitting out a deep breath upon watching this scene. This battle had truly left him shocked.</span></p>
