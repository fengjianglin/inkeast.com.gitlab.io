 <p><strong>Chapter 341 - Academy Exchange</strong></p>
 <p>The craze brought forth by the Hunting War had lasted for approximately one month in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, before it finally started to dissipate. As the Heavenly Rankings headed towards stability, the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy headed towards its usual peacefulness once again.</p>
 <p>In this peace, there were some matters whose announcements had attracted people to enthusiastically discuss. One of them being that Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had collaborated and formed a team, and had taken the task of killing Mo Longzi from the Mission Hall.</p>
 <p>This matter had immediately caused an uproar in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Mo Longzi’s terrible name could be said to be very fierce within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. It’s said that as long as those students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy that were training in the outside world ran into him, almost all of them would either be sadistically tortured to death, or suffer an extremely miserable death. This caused an implacable hatred within the student masses. However, although Mo Longzi was savage and cruel, his strength was exceedingly tyrannical. Within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, the number of people who were able to be a threat to him would only be two, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>In the past, Shen Cangsheng would head out alone, by himself. However, he had returned without any results. This time, he had finally collaborated with Li Xuantong. Obviously, they had decided on a plan that they had to get rid of this poison of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>The 1st and 2nd Rank of the Heavenly Rankings collaborating was something beyond worth seeing. However, it was helpless for the masses, as they were unable to follow the two, and could only quietly wait within the academy for the good news. All of them believed that Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, this astonishing and absolute duo, would definitely not return with empty hands.</p>
 <p>However, it’s obvious that this kind of news would not come so soon. Therefore, approximately ten days after Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had left the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, much of this craze had also gradually faded away to peacefulness.</p>
 <p>However, after this matter, there was another one that had broken the peacefulness of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, yet again.</p>
 <p>It was well-known by everyone that there were countless spiritual academies within the Great Thousand World. Although the names of the Five Great Academies had the greatest reputation, this did not mean that there were truly no other spiritual academies whose strength was on par with the Five Great Academies.</p>
 <p>There were a few similarly strong spiritual academies whose strength were not weaker than the Five Great Academies. However, their reputation and fame were, all in all, somewhat weaker. Therefore, when people often talked about spiritual academies, the Five Great Academies would be the most easily remembered by people.</p>
 <p>Due to this point, it had undoubtedly stimulated those strong academies that had the qualifications to challenge the Five Great Academies, but were somewhat only lacking in fame and prestige. They had thought of all sorts of methods, and searched for geniuses all over the place in an attempt rely on them to promote the academy’s name as those geniuses rose.</p>
 <p>Naturally, this kind of fame and reputation had to rely on the namesake of the “Five Great Academies”.</p>
 <p>Therefore, this had lead to the creation of the so-called “Academy Exchange”. Simply speaking, after a certain period of time, there would be some strong academies who would bring their teams towards the “Five Great Academies” and use them as a pretext to call for students to compare notes. From its appearance, it looked good-natured. However, the competitive and provocative intent contained within was already self-evident.</p>
 <p>Although the “Five Great Academies” were clear about these so-called “Exchanges”, they did not have any means to reject them. After all, their opposition’s reasons were truly high sounding and dignified. Being the Five Great Academies, their prestige and reputations were at stake. Therefore, they did not have any reason to reject.</p>
 <p>Similarly, after more than a month since the end of the Hunting War, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy welcomed an Academy Exchange. This undeniably caused the peaceful Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to become restless and disturbed once again.</p>
 <p>Quite a few outstanding students started to roll their sleeves up for action and were prepared to reveal their abilities in this Academy Exchange. They wanted to let those fellows understand that the quality of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy wasn’t something that any random spiritual academy could compare to.</p>
 <p>Being one of the Five Great Academies, they naturally had their own kind of arrogance. Perhaps, they were very ordinary within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, regardless of that, they had all surmounted all difficulties to be able to become students of this academy. This was what they drew their arrogance from.</p>
 <p>Therefore, this Academy Exchange was something the student masses of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had risen their heads and looked forward to, unhurriedly as it arrived.</p>
 <p>This year, the academy that was undergoing the Exchange with the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy. It was a strong spiritual academy that sat within the Ancient Cauldron Continent. It’s said that the fame and reputation of the Ancient Cauldron Continent was lower than the Northern Heavenly Continent. However, underestimating a spiritual academy that took its name from the continent it was on due to this lower fame and reputation might be a rather stupid thing to do.</p>
 <p>Therefore, during this period, all the students within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy would pay attention to this matter. The degree of attention had even exceeded that of the Hunting War.</p>
 <p>After all, regardless of the changes that happened due to the Hunting War, the most outstanding person was still a person of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, in such an Exchange, if they were to lose, that would sully the fame and reputation of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Regardless of a single defeat, all of their faces would turn ugly.</p>
 <p>Therefore, at this time, the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy were extraordinarily cooperative. Regardless of the contradictions within the internal factions, they had to deal with this Exchange before settling their disputes. If not, they would incur the despise and contempt of all the students.</p>
 <p>As a result, this exchange had proceeded as planned.</p>
 <p>The location of the Exchange was set up in the northern square. It could be seen that the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had regarded this exchange exceedingly important. After all, this concerned the fame and reputation of their spiritual academy.</p>
 <p>To a founding spiritual academy, fame and reputation were very important matters.</p>
 <p>For such an exchange, to put it nicely, one can call it as somewhat of a little public shaming venue. If the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was unable to defend this place, it would have quite a bit negative effect towards the fame and reputation of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Following the launch of this Exchange, the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy became more solemn and serious. This was due to the sensations they got from the students of the Ancient Cauldron Academy that had come over. These students seemed to have undergone rigorous screening and selection process, as none of them appeared to be easy to be dealt with.</p>
 <p>This exchange had continued for three whole days.</p>
 <p>On the first day of the exchange, both sides had sent their experts out. However, none of them were able to gain any superiority. A few of the outstanding and famous students on the Heavenly Rankings obtained some victories, as well as some losses. On a whole, the situation could be said as being stable.</p>
 <p>However, this result caused the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to withdraw their contempt and scorn. This Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy had come prepared. Added with the fact that their 1st Rank and 2nd Rank on the Heavenly Rankings, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, were outside of the academy on a mission to kill Mo Longzi, obviously, they could not come back on such a short notice. Furthermore, Mu Chen, who had achieved widespread fame and stepped into the 3rd Rank of the Heavenly Rankings, had mysteriously disappeared for over a month, with no one knowing where he went.</p>
 <p>With their three strongest people not present, if they continued with their negligence, wanting to achieve victory in this Exchange might truly become a difficult task.</p>
 <p>Thus, on the second day, the top ten ranks within than Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Heavenly Rankings, He Yao, Su Xuan, Xu Huang, Zhao Qingshan and the rest of the top ranked students all came out. With such a lineup, Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy final managed to achieve an overwhelming victory and suppressed the grandeur of the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy back down.</p>
 <p>However, this kind of suppression only lasted for a day. On the third day, the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy did not continue to send out more outstanding students. In fact, they had only sent one person out.</p>
 <p>However, it was this one person that had started his challenge from the 9th Rank of the Heavenly Rankings. Within a short span of a day, under the countless horrified gazes of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy students, he had successively defeat Mu Fengyang, Xu Huang, Zhao Qingshan, Su Xuan and the rest of the outstanding students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy…</p>
 <p>The entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was in an uproar due to that.</p>
 <p>More than half of the top ten within the Heavenly Rankings that took action were eliminated by that person. Moreover, that person’s actions were very fierce and vicious. Seemingly all of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy students that lost to him had suffered serious injuries. This kind of violent and vicious way had incurred the combined wrath and anger of the student masses of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, they still had no way to deal with that person’s strength.</p>
 <p>Therefore, they could only place their final hope on the shoulders of He Yao, who had yet to lose.</p>
 <p>However, in the end, this kind of hope was still mercilessly shattered.</p>
 <p>He Yao was able to contend with the opponent, and had used all of his means and methods. However, due to a wrong move, he still regretfully lost. Therefore, the top ten of the Heavenly Rankings had seemingly been completely wiped out.</p>
 <p>The voices from the entire side of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy students were instantly extinguished. Obviously, no one thought that there would actually be such a situation in this Exchange.</p>
 <p>On the contrary, the atmosphere on the side of the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy was in high spirits. Some of their students already had contempt and disdain in their gazes as they looked at the students from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. In their hearts, they had truly believed that their Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy had already exceeded the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy in terms of strength, and was already sufficient to replace this academy from one of the Five Great Academies.</p>
 <p>After this fight, every student from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy came to know the vicious person that had seemingly caused a complete wipeout to the top ten within the Heavenly Rankings. It was a youth by the name of Liu Zheng. His talent was absolutely astonishing. Furthermore, what made people feel shocked and astounded was that he was once chosen by the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, in the end, he was unable to pass through the evaluations. After being eliminated, he had switched to the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy..</p>
 <p>Yet, this student that was previously being eliminated had appeared once again in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. This was an unexpectedly present scenario. With such a mocking irony, it caused a fiery pain within the hearts of all the students from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>No wonder why this fellow would be that vicious when he made his moves! He was relying on this to take revenge on the fact that their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had no eyes!</p>
 <p>The students from the Northern Heavens Spiritual ACademy were all furious and angry. Those evaluations could not be considered as completely fair, as it relied on both strength and luck. Although this Liu Zheng had shocking talent, what he was lacking was only some luck. Speaking of that, there simply wasn’t anyone to blame. However, from the viciousness shown in his attacks, he appeared to have excessive grievances.</p>
 <p>Feeling furious, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy students continued to search for their finest students that have yet to make their move. However, following that, they discovered that other than the trio of Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong and Mu Chen being missing, there seemed to be no student who was stronger than He Yao in their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy…</p>
 <p>This result caused all of them to tear up. Could it be that this Exchange would end with such a depressing result? If that were to happen, once the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy leaves, they might immediately proclaim about it wantonly. At that moment, the fame and reputation of their Northern Heavens Spiritual ACademy would suffer a serious blow. This might even affect their prestige, as well as their ranking within the Five Great Academies…</p>
 <p>However, hope would always inadvertently appear. Just as all of the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy were in tears, Su Xuan had recommended a person that had incurred the agreement of the masses.</p>
 <p>That person was naturally the only one, other than Mu Chen and the other missing two, within the top ten of the Heavenly Rankings that had yet to take action.</p>
 <p>That person, was the one and only Luo Li.</p>
