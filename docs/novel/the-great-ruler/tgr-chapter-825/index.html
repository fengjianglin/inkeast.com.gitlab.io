Seeing that figure, Mu Chen’s tensed heart had completely loosened up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala appeared before Mu Chen with her cold face indifferently looking at the Spiritual Energy lion. Shortly after, she stretched her hand out and gently slapped the lion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s face was indifferent as she made a grasping gesture. Light started to gather within her palm and formed into a Spiritual Energy light ball. The violent Spiritual Energy was as docile as a sheep in her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at the Spiritual Energy light ball, before raising her eyes and coldly stared at Qiu Taiyin, whose face had been instantly replaced with deathly white, and indifferently said, “Sky Profound Lion Seal? Why is something unique to the Sky Profound Palace in your hands?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The commotion in the surroundings had disappeared at this moment as countless bewildered gazes fell onto Qiu Taiyin. Right now, the Sky Profound Palace and the Great Havenlaw Domain could be considered as enemies, and Qiu Taiyin possessed the unique object of the Sky Profound Palace. So how could he not be doubted?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Taiyin looked at Mandala’s face that had no expression and couldn’t help trembling. His face was deathly pale and he had regretted the instant when he unleashed the Sky Profound Lion Seal. He never expected to lose his rationale after being angered to such a degree by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Domain Lord… Lord Ruler, this Sky Profound Seal is something that this subordinate obtained from killing a Sky Profound Palace expert.” Qiu Taiyin forced himself to speak up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” Mandala’s golden pupils looked at Qiu Taiyin. Sensing her gaze, the latter felt his entire body turning cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A unique method is required to utilize this Sky Profound Lion Seal, which is only possessed by some Elders of the Sky Profound Palace. According to what you have said, you killed a Sky Profound Palace’s Elder?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold killing intent spread out from Mandala’s lazy voice, “Then, do you know who that Elder that you have killed is? Furthermore, why did you not report such a huge contribution? If you have killed an Elder of the Sky Profound Palace, I will still bestow you the King title, despite your loss today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Taiyin’s entire body was trembling as a cold sweat endlessly poured out, practically drenching his clothes. He felt an extreme fear from being looked at by Mandala’s golden pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire region was quiet and many people were looking at Qiu Taiyin. The terrifying pressure caused Qiu Taiyin’s rationale to swiftly collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

He turned into a streak of light and swiftly fled for the outskirts of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala coldly looked at Qiu Taiyin, who had lost control, and gently waved her hand, causing the space in this entire region to freeze. Qiu Taiyin’s body was like a fly that fell onto a sticky paper and could not budge…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala flicked her finger and Qiu Taiyin ruthlessly flew back towards the King’s Ceremony Stage and was slammed into the ground. The Spiritual Energy in his body was completely dissipated by Mandala, rendering him unable to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take him away. Looks like the Sky Profound Palace has arranged quite a few moths in my Great Havenlaw Domain and I believe he might know them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala indifferently said as the enforcement team came and swiftly took Qiu Taiyin away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts watched Qiu Taiyin being taken away, before shifting their gazes onto Mandala, who had a cold face. In an instant, no one dared to breathe too loudly, since they could sense the rage in Mandala’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala looked down at all the experts in this region, before a faint voice sounded next their ears, “The Hunting War will soon arrive, you all should know what this represents. Even if my Great Havenlaw Domain is a peak force in the Northern Region, there’s still a chance that it might be devoured during the Hunting War. If my Great Havenlaw Domain ceases to exist, all of you will lose your status and shelter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of many experts trembled. The competition in the Northern Region was extremely brutal. Without the shelter of such a huge force, it would be much more dangerous if they wanted to cultivate by themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, if you guys don’t want to lose this shelter and become someone’s prey, then bring out your loyalty. I will not mistreat anyone loyal to the Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">““We sincerely comply to Lord Ruler’s instructions.”” All the experts echoed with their voices filled with revere. The reason why they could stand upright in the Northern Region and enjoy so many resources was all because of Mandala, the shelter of an Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen quietly watched this scene and felt a little shaken by the power possessed by Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses. Only such experts could stand straight and shelter others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s golden pupils turned towards Mu Chen. “Since there’s an outcome in the King’s Ceremony, I will hereby announce that starting from today on, Mu Chen will become the tenth King of my Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless envious gazes were directed at Mu Chen. It was an incredible feat to be bestowed the King title at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various Kings sighed as they nodded their heads. The Blood Hawk King stared at Mu Chen with fear and a trace of regret in his eyes. He clearly did not expect Mu Chen to grow so quickly. If he knew, he wouldn’t have caused trouble for Mu Chen back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Provoking such an opponent with great potential was clearly extremely foolish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As the tenth King, you have the qualifications to form your own force.” Mandala looked at Mu Chen. Generally speaking, becoming a King would obtain a great amount of resources in the Great Havenlaw Domain, which was enough to support him to build a force similar to the Nine Kings. Naturally, that required time to develop as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people had their gazes focused on Mu Chen, especially those of the Nine Nether Palace. Their eyes were filled with nervousness and unwillingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Mu Chen built his own force, he would break free from the Nine Nether Palace and would no longer become the Commander of the Nine Nether Palace. At that time, despite how much they allied themselves together, it was still different to being together now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen had just been in the Great Havenlaw Domain for a year, everyone in the Nine Nether Palace knew that it was Mu Chen’s numerous life-and-death battles that swiftly pulled their Nine Nether Palace up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Mu Chen is truly formidable, to be bestowed with the Kingship so quickly.” Tang Rou’s heart was a little innocent, since she couldn’t help chuckling and feeling happy for Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Tang Bing gave that nitwitted little sister of hers a glare and crossed her arms, fuming with anger, since she did not even give the awe-inspiring Mu Chen a gaze. That’s because she knew that losing Mu Chen would be a huge blow to their Nine Nether Palace. Although she knew that Mu Chen couldn’t be blamed for it, since there was a huge difference between a King and a Commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether was the most indifferent to it, and didn’t seem to be worried. She was looking at Mu Chen with a smile on her face. Her relationship was too deep with Mu Chen. The Bloodlink Bond practically bound the two of them together, so she wasn’t too bothered about Mu Chen building his own force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Mu Chen was also briefly stunned by Mandala’s words, before casting a glance at the Nine Nether Palace. Looking at those anxious gazes, he smiled, “I don’t want to build my own force, I will stay at the Nine Nether Palace. That won’t affect me getting those resources, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew how complicated it was to set up his own force in the year he spent in the Nine Nether Palace. If he placed his energy in it, then it would definitely affect his cultivation. Therefore, he could not give up the greater good for the small benefit. Ruining himself because of a so-called “force”.</span></p>

No matter what he wanted to do, Nine Nether would definitely not obstruct him, so there wasn’t a need for them to split.</span></p>

Clearly, this was the first time that they have seen someone giving up the opportunity to build their own force. After all, only by having your own force, would you possess your own troop, which would belong entirely to himself.</span></p>

Every single one of the Nine Nether Palace was looking at Mu Chen with excitement and a blaze in their eyes. Clearly, they did not expect Mu Chen to give up the chance to form his own force and remain in their Nine Nether Palace as well.</span></p>

That fellow did have some conscience after all. Her effort in gathering that Sovereign Spiritual Liquid for his cultivation wasn’t in vain.</span></p>

Although this answer wasn’t too unexpected for her, her gaze, which looked at Mu Chen, became even more gentle.</span></p>

Since you have given up on building your own force, then the resources will be added to the Nine Nether Palace. Of course, you can also use them as you wish.”</span></p>

Right now, what he wanted was, naturally, the Blood Essences of the ten Divine Beasts to cultivate the Dragon-Phoenix Sutra.</span></p>
