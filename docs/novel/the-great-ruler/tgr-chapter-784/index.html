The sudden change of events had clearly left Mu Chen extremely shocked. However, his reaction wasn’t slow. After seeing that light figure, he had acted out of reflex as well. Incorporeal lightning flickered on his palm as the Nether Demon Heart Lightning burst out in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all these years, Mu Chen had experienced tons of life-and-death battles, the rich fighting experience had already been imprinted into his bones. Therefore, in this short amount of time, he did not use Spiritual Energy to obstruct that figure. However, he had chosen to move at his fastest and also attacked with the most bizarre Nether Demon Heart Lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite that, his figure had froze for an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was this moment of being frozen that made him lose his best chance. Cai Xiao’s figure, who stood close by, had instantly disappeared, before appearing before the black light in an instant, swiftly pointing her finger out like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lustrous white light blossomed from that slender figure as space lightly fluctuated and was torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Cai Xiao’s attacks, even that black figure did not dare to belittle her. He had bent two of his fingers together and a black light swept out with a chilled aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Tidal waves swept from the Dragon-Phoenix Pool below and Cai Xiao’s figure trembled, before taking a step back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>

The blacklight dissipated and the figure was thoroughly revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone around the White Bones Mountain immediately directed their gazes over. Thereafter, a series of exclamations resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the… Netherworld Prince of the Netherworld Palace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the commotion outside the White Bones Mountain, Mu Chen couldn’t help narrowing his gaze and directed his eyes over. He saw a black figure standing on the sky. He had black hair reaching his shoulders and extremely handsome looks. However, he looked rather cold. His gaze was like a sharp blade, which made others feel like they were being pierced by his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood on the sky with an indifferent gaze as he faced Cai Xiao. There wasn’t any panic in his expression, he appeared calm. Compared to Liu Yan, his bearing was a level higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it was the second ranker of the Dragon-Phoenix Record, the Netherworld Prince.” Mu Chen looked at the black-clothed man, frowning his brows as he lightly said, “With your status, why bother sneaking around?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since I can obtain the biggest harvest with the simplest method, why not?” The black-clothed Netherworld Prince smiled. His gaze was like a blade as he looked at Mu Chen, “That Liu Yan isn’t an easy opponent, so I’m more than willing to see a situation of both sides being injured.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pity, your idea of fishing for benefits has failed.” Mu Chen smiled, except that he held cautiousness in his gaze. He felt an extremely cold feeling coming from the Netherworld Price. That fellow was like a venomous snake in the dark. It was fine if he did not attack, but the moment he attacks, it would definitely be a definite death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is a little pity.” The Netherworld Price nodded his head and did not refute. He had hidden there with a unique method. He was intending on killing both Mu Chen and Liu Yan when they’re both heavily injured before entering the Dragon-Phoenix Pool. However, he never expected the formidable Cai Xiao to pop up out of nowhere, which shattered his plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze moved to Cai Xiao as he slowly asked, “Who exactly are you? Amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region, there isn’t anyone like you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao couldn’t be bothered to reply him. She pointed outside the White Bones Mountain. “If you don’t leave now, it won’t be so easy for you to leave anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince slightly narrowed his eyes as he looked at Cai Xiao with a dark light surging in the depth of his eyes as the space around him slightly distorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Cai Xiao’s brows had lightly jumped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts outside the White Bones Mountain watched with their hearts intensely thumping If the Netherworld Prince and that mysterious girl were to clash, they might have a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although that mysterious girl was extremely formidable, the Netherworld Prince wasn’t an easy opponent as well. The moment they fight, it would definitely be earth-shaking and the intensity would definitely far exceed Mu Chen and Liu Yan’s confrontation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearly frozen atmosphere enveloped the peak of the White Bones Mountain. However, just when everyone thought that an earth-shaking battle would take place again, the fluctuation around the Netherworld Prince retracted as he swiftly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince did not lose his rationale because of the Dragon-Phoenix Pool. Therefore, he understood that it would be extremely tough to seize the Dragon-Phoenix Pool under the mysterious girl. The mystery of the latter was something that even he couldn’t see through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Mu Chen, he did not place much importance towards him. Even if his battle with Liu Yan was stunning, someone like the Netherworld Prince wouldn’t fear him to that point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he did not have an absolute confidence to seize the Dragon-Phoenix Pool, there was no need to be deadlocked. Time was precious and this Dragon-Phoenix Pool wasn’t the only one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the Netherworld Prince had chosen to decisively retreat. Even if it would cause shock in some gazes, this sort of external factor clearly could not shake the Netherworld Prince’s heart in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when he left, he swept his blade-like gaze at Mu Chen and the chill within made Mu Chen feel a little cold. However, the latter did not react to this, since the relationship between the Great Havenlaw Domain and Netherworld Palace was bad to begin with. Every time the Dragon-Phoenix Haven opened, the geniuses of their Great Havenlaw Domain would be slaughtered by the Netherworld Palace, causing a loss in reputation for the Great Havenlaw Domain; the relationship between the two was extremely poor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, even without today’s matter, Mu Chen knew that if they were to face later on, the Netherworld Prince would definitely not hesitate to act towards him once the chance arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like it’s another trouble.” Mu Chen murmured to himself. He had just managed to cause Liu Yan to retreat, yet the Netherworld Prince had popped out. In addition with the Divine Palace’s Fang Yi, whom they met back in the Dragon-Phoenix Ancient City, he had basically offended all the top rankers on the Dragon-Phoenix Record.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen could only helplessly shrug. Demand exceeds supply, if one wanted to obtain an opportunity, it would be unavoidable to be an enemy, since that was human nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked a the direction which the Netherworld Prince had disappeared from, before looking outside around the White Bones Mountain, where those people that were stirred by the appearance of the Netherworld Prince were located. Staring at his gaze, they were also a little resentful as they retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen paid no attention to those guys that were preparing to fish for benefits and lightly nodded his head at Cai Xiao. He no longer hesitated as he moved, leaping into the Dragon-Phoenix Pool that was surging with immortal aura under all the envious gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure was swiftly concealed by the Dragon-Phoenix Pool. Shortly after, a dense white mist soared into the sky. As the white mist spread out, it had completely enveloped the White Bones Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within that white mist, there were the shadows of a dragon and phoenix that could be seen flashing along with a draconic roar and phoenix cry ringing out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A peculiar scent spread out from the White Bones Mountain. Those that sniffed this scent felt the surging of Spiritual Energy in their bodies. It was a temptation that originated from the depth of their bloodlines, tempting others to integrate with it.</span></p>

In the Dragon-Phoenix Pool, Mu Chen sat at the deepest part as the clear blood of the Demonic Ape enveloped his body. The mild sensation swiftly made the injuries that he had sustained during the fight with Liu Yan disappear. Even the exhausted Spiritual Energy in his body had swiftly recovered.</span></p>

Those runes separated from the bones and swam out like fishes, before they endlessly covered Mu Chen’s figure.</span></p>

Those blood traces were the Blood Essences left behind by the True Dragon and Phoenix!</span></p>

She swiftly formed her seals at lightning speed, before they were formed into a palm-sized sparkling and translucent compass.</span></p>

This compass of hers was refined using the scales of a True Dragon, thus having strong senses against the similar bloodline in this world. Even if it was separated by a distant space, it could still easily sense the location.</span></p>
