If this ruin before them was truly left behind by the Fourth Palace Master of the Ancient Haven Palace, then he might be able to obtain some information regarding the Ancient Haven Palace from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong?” Mandala immediately questioned when she saw the changes in Mu Chen’s expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her question, Mu Chen did not hide it from her and told her everything he knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancient Haven Palace, the Fourth Palace Master?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s words, the Sky Vulture Emperor and the rest were instantly startled. Although they did not know who the Fourth Palace Master was, they knew how powerful the Ancient Haven Palace was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the ancient times, the Ancient Haven Palace was the Overlord of the Greatlaw Continent. Although the Ancient Haven Palace had already perished, they still left behind relics in the Greatlaw Continent. Thus, many peak forces in the Great Havenlaw Domain had been spending all their efforts to search for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded as he looked at Mandala, before realising that she was slightly distracted. But she recovered very quickly and said with deep thoughts, “The Fourth Palace Master… I have read about him in the ancient text before. He seems to have perished in this ancient battlefield. It’s just that I never expected it to be here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s said that back then, he had fought with the Skyeater Evil Emperor to the point that the sky had darkened and the both of them perished…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Skyeater Evil Emperor?” Mu Chen and the rest were stunned by such news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A powerhouse of the Fiend Clans, with strength comparable to Greater Earth Sovereigns. Back then, he was one of the Commanders that invaded the Greatlaw Continent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala explained with her golden pupils looking towards the black pyramid within the shattered space and a brilliance flashed across her eyes. “If this really was left behind by the Fourth Palace Master, then the Spiritual Divine Liquid that was left behind would definitely be extremely powerful. We definitely can’t allow the other forces, like the Divine Pavilion, obtain it. Otherwise, it would definitely break the current situation in the Northern Region. With their character, our Great Havenlaw Domain would definitely be the first in line to be affected.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head and gradually calmed his emotions, before directing his gaze towards the other direction in this region and asked in doubt, “Isn’t this ruin being eyed upon by the other forces as well? Why are we not seeing their traces?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This shattered spatial region is extremely vast, the other peak forces are in the other directions. They’re extremely far from us because there isn’t an entrance to this Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury. As long as one has enough Fallen Origin Pellets, they can enter from any direction.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala smiled, “Generally speaking, opening an entrance will be enough for everyone to enter. But naturally, the other forces will not be willing to let others enjoy the Fallen Origin Pellets that they have obtained themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he immediately understood the logic behind it. Although a large amount of Fallen Origin Pellets could be saved, it was clearly not what the other peak forces wanted. They were more willing to pay more than to let the other forces benefit from their hard work. If one didn't have enough Fallen Origin Pellets in their hands, then they could return, thus decreasing one competitor, which was the most crucial factor for the peak forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, they could only rely on themselves, and if they couldn’t, then it could only be said that they’re not qualified to compete for the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury is one that’s filled with many dangers. Therefore, only the Kings can follow me in. As for the rest of you, you guys can stay here and prepare to receive us.” Mandala cast a glance at the massive troops that were behind her. In such a dangerous area like the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury, if the large-scaled troops were to enter, not only would they not provide any help, they would become a burden instead. If anything happened, then the outcome was simply unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor and the rest nodded their heads. The reason why they brought the troops here was because they were worried that without the Kings, the troops would easily be surrounded outside. Although this place was also dangerous, it’s definitely safer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But this way, we will have to make King Mu suffer.” The Mountain Splitting King looked at Mu Chen. Without them being able to bring the troops in, the one that suffered the most would probably be Mu Chen. After all, as a Battle Formation Master, there would be a great decrease in their strength if they lost their troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in response to their pity, Mu Chen calmly smiled. “Although Battle Will is a path for me, it will have a negative effect if one is too over-reliant on it. On the contrary, my strength is not only limited to Battle Will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he spoke in a calm tone, there wasn’t any forcefulness in it. A light surged in his pupils, it was the confidence he had in himself. That’s because, in Mu Chen’s view, even though he could get stronger with the power of Battle Will, it was an external factor. In this world, only the strength that you could cultivate yourself was the most stable and would never change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, even if Mu Chen knew that he had talent in the path of Battle Will, he was only briefly happy. That’s because he never thought about giving up on his own cultivation for Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So even when he had lost the power of Battle Will, Mu Chen was also confident that he wouldn’t be ordinary with his own ability, which he had already proven based on his own ability in the past experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Mountain Splitting King and the rest heard Mu Chen’s calm words, they were first stunned, before their faces gradually turned grave with admiration in their hearts. To grasp the powerful Battle Will and view it so lightly, not even they were confident that they could achieve that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, they vaguely understood why this young man before they could rise in the Great Havenlaw Domain in just a short two years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well said. The path of an expert is not to limited by power, but controlling power!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala gently clapped with admiration filled on her face. It was so much so that even the Sleeping Emperor, who had always been in a sleepy state had opened his eyes and cast a glance at Mu Chen. Likewise, he must have also been astonished by Mu Chen’s state of mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was a little awkward from Mandala’s praises and could only dryly laugh while shrugging his shoulders. He only felt that he could not rely on the power of Battle Will too much. It’s was just case that one day, when he loses his troop, he would then fall from the clouds. If that happened, then he probably wouldn’t have any chance to climb his way back up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get prepared to move out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala smiled and did not speak any further. She gently raised her hand and her silhouette had slowly risen to the sky with the three Emperors behind her and the Kings further back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This formation could be considered as a luxurious formation and these were basically all the elites of the Great Havenlaw Domain. If anything happened to them in the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury, then the Great Havenlaw Domain would probably collapse in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and the rest followed Mandala and had gradually approached the shattered space. With their approach, they had finally realise the terrifying oppression that the shattered space contained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shattered space constantly wriggled in the sky with ancient talisman runes wandering by the cracks, emitting a lustre that interlinked together and formed a dark-red barrier that sealed the crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they stood before that crack, despite the shattered space being sealed, the oppression that vaguely escaped from it still made them feel like they were slightly suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this spatial crack, even Mandala had a slightly solemn expression. When she had just discovered this ruin, she had already tried to use her power as an Earth Sovereign to break the talisman rune open and the outcome of it was evident, a failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were too many experts that have perished in the Fallen Battlefield, with Earth Sovereigns that were stronger than her. Those fallen experts had caused this ruin to be enveloped in a bizarre yet powerful energy. Although it couldn’t launch any attacks, it possessed defensive capabilities, as if they were guarding the eternal peace of those perished experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the rule of the Fallen Battlefield, and even powerful existences like Mandala couldn’t break it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala clenched her tiny fist and a Universal Bracelet appeared in her hand. She gently stroked it and a buzzing noise resounded as currents flowed out of the Universal Bracelet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those currents were like giant pythons that coiled before Mandala. Those currents were the Fallen Origin Pellets, except that the amount wasn’t any lower than 100,000.</span></p>

When Mu Chen and the rest took a breath in, the spiritual energy in their bodies grew excited.</span></p>

Even if a Fifth Grade Sovereign absorbed them, he would probably have a significant improvement in his own Spiritual Energy.</span></p>

Instantly, the current of Fallen Origin Pellets exploded, then it was compressed by an unparalleled power.</span></p>

As if the small-sized liquid was even denser than the mountains.</span></p>

If he refined 100,000 Fallen Origin Pellets, then he would require at least a few months of time. But in Mandala’s hands, it only took a rubbing gesture for her to accomplish it. Thus, one could tell how terrifying an Earth Sovereign was.</span></p>

Instantly, the liquid, which was refined from Fallen Origin Pellets, had whistled out and dropped onto the ancient talisman runes on the spatial crack.</span></p>

As an azure smoke rose, Mu Chen was startled to witness that the ancient talisman runes were starting to dim. When they had dimmed to the extreme, they disappeared.</span></p>
