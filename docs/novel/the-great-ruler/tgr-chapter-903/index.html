 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is that possible?” Hong Yu’s countenance turned pale. Their Battle Will genius was only defeated in a battle. The Spiritual Energy in his body was still stable, so how could he suddenly not be able to control Battle Will anymore?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen paid no attention to Hong Yu’s countenance, which had turned pale, and looked at the Battle Will genius of the Demon Gate. “Not only will this Battle Will genius of yours not be able to control Battle Will anymore, he will not be able to wake up as well. Right now, his brain is dead. When the Spiritual Energy in his body dries up, his body will rot along with it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu was speechless. It took a long while for her to recover from her shock. Her enchanting face had turned ashen at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could tell that Mu Chen wasn’t lying, so that meant that the only Battle Will genius of their Demon Gate had been, indeed, crippled by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Ming’s means are extremely bizarre and ruthless. It’s still the first for me to see a person’s will being destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen frowned. He felt that the will in the mind of this Battle Will genius seemed to have been forcefully removed and devoured. Such a bizarre means made even Mu Chen feel his heart tighten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like, in this Hunting War, there were all sorts of evil that he had to be cautious of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Demon Gate will remember this grudge and we will definitely look for the Netherworld Palace to settle this in the future!” Hong Yu clenched her teeth. Her pupils were filled with range. She had been enraged by the Netherworld Palace’s ruthless means. After all, their Demon Gate had paid a huge price to nurture their Battle Will genius and he was now completely crippled by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Hong Yu, do you guys have any recent information on the Netherworld Palace’s latest movements?” Mu Chen asked. Although he hadn’t crossed hands with Lin Ming, Mu Chen had a feeling that Lin Ming would come for him in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu briefly pondered before saying, “The party of the Netherworld Palace that Lin Ming is in has only started to take action more frequently over the last two weeks. He had been extremely low-key in the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Within two weeks, Lin Ming has led the Netherworld Palace to make a move against eight forces. The eight forces all had a similar factor, they all had a decently talented Commander. The outcome of those battles was evident, Lin Ming annihilated all his opponents. Right now, every force is afraid of his infamous name.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen squinted his eyes. “What about those Commanders defeated by him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu pondered with her brows knitted. “I don’t seem to hear any information regarding them…can it be that they have also been…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gently nodded his head while feeling shocked in his heart. If the other Commanders also had such an outcome after being defeated by Lin Ming, then this Lin Ming did possess a ruthless method of forcefully extracting the will of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was another troublesome fellow to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Ming had a smooth journey until he encountered Zhantai Liuli. Their confrontation ended in a tie and neither one managed to gain the upper hand.” Hong Yu continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like Lin Ming has become a Battle Formation Master.” Mu Chen nodded his head. To be able to confront Zhantai Liuli, who had inherited the Sky Formation Emperor, then that meant that Lin Ming must have become a Battle Formation Master as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Hong Yu’s face was a little unsightly, since it definitely wasn’t good news for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What does Miss Hong Yu intend to do now?” Mu Chen lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re already in the inner section of the Fallen Battlefield, so we have to quickly gather up with the others of the Demon Gate. I believe that your Great Havenlaw Domain has the same intentions as well, right?” Hong Yu did not hide her motive. After all, those forces that entered the inner section all had the same thinking as well. As long as they managed to band their forces together, they could prevent themselves from being surrounded by the other forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the other forces all gathered together, then that would form a powerful opposing situation and if a battle broke out at that time, it would definitely startle the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gently nodded as he smiled. “I wonder, what does the Demon Gate think of the Netherworld Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As a peak force in the Northern Region, our Demon Gate naturally can’t suck it up on this matter. When we gather our forces, we will look for them.” Hong Yu’s voice was cold. She had clearly been enraged by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled. “But at that time, the Netherworld Palace would have probably also gathered their forces and they’re not any weaker than the Demon Gate. With the addition of Lin Ming, I’m afraid that it will not be so easy to deal with them, even if the Demon Gate goes all-out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu was stunned. She looked at Mu Chen and an enchanting arc rose on the corner of her lips as she chuckled, “Brother Mu can be honest with your intentions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Join forces with us to get rid of Lin Ming and let the Netherworld Palace heavily suffer.” Mu Chen bluntly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Some time ago, we heard that Lin Ming seemed to be extremely interested in Brother Mu. According to my speculations, I’m afraid that they will come looking for you not too long from now. Brother Mu is trying to join forces with our Demon Gate to deal with them?” Hong Yu’s glance roamed as she smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although Lin Ming is formidable, I’m not afraid of him.” Mu Chen smiled. Although he spoke in a calm tone, it had self-confidence in it that made Hong Yu unable to refute his words. After all, she had witnessed the numerous miracles that were forged by the young man before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Netherworld Palace is not weak, so it’s not easy for my Great Havenlaw Domain to devour them. But if we have the help of the Demon Gate, we should be able to gravely injure them. So I believe that our cooperation is of mutual benefits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu fell into her thoughts, since she was clearly shaken by that proposal. However, she did not recklessly agree. Instead, she replied, “I will convey this matter. After all, I cannot make the decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, even if we cooperate, our target is only the Netherworld Palace. As for the other forces, I’m afraid that my Demon Gate will not interfere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu was extremely smart. She naturally knew about the bad blood between the Great Havenlaw Domain, Divine Pavilion and the Sky Profound Palace. So she naturally wouldn’t want to provoke two of the peak forces that were against the Great Havenlaw Domain just to deal with the Netherworld Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen casually nodded his head, since he clearly did not expect for the Demon Gate to fight the Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace with them. In this Hunting War, there was only a cooperation of benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then we’ll leave first. When my Demon Gate gathers up, I will inform you if there are any movements from our side. At that time, Hong Yu will look forward to Brother Mu unleashing your might.” Finishing her words, she did not stay any longer and gave a bewitching smile towards Mu Chen before waving her hand and returned to the Demon Gate’s army. Thereafter, their party whistled out, turning into a streak of light, and disappeared towards the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to work together with the Demon Gate?” When the Demon Gate’s party left, the Kings all looked at Mu Chen. Although Mu Chen had just broken through to the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm, even someone as powerful as the Mountain Splitting King did not dare to belittle Mu Chen from this period of working together. Therefore, no one had thought that he was being reckless in his decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although I’m not sure how long this cooperation can last, it can at least help us lessen some pressure. After all, we can’t offend every single peak forces out there,” said Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He naturally did not hope for the cooperation between them to be firm. But since the Demon Gate had grudges with the Netherworld Palace and if the Netherworld Palace really dared to make a move towards them, he wouldn’t mind cooperating with the Demon Gate to make the Netherworld Palace bleed.</span></p>
