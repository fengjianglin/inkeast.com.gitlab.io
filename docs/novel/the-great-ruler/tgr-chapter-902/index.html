 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A storm of Spiritual Energy was spread out on the Fallen Battlefield as the brutal competition continued. An intense struggle for the Fallen Origin Pellets and inheritances was being unfolded by all the forces. In the battle, there were some top forces that couldn’t afford the losses and had no choice but to retreat from the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, it wasn’t an easy matter to retreat from the battlefield when the Hunting War had progressed this far. That’s because there was no lacking of forces wanting to retreat from the battlefield to preserve their strength and being ambushed, resulting in the experts of their force being completely annihilated. Those that had managed to escape clearly couldn’t maintain their faction anymore. Thus, there were some forces with decent reputations being dispersed in the Northern Region. The fame and reputations that they once possessed would also vanish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Hunting War, there was no eternal predator here and no one knew if the predator would be turned into prey in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was under this brutal atmosphere that Mu Chen led the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party and left the seclusive location, travelling towards the gathering location of the Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their party could be considered as a formidable one and due to the commotion that they had caused in the Death Ruin, their party was immediately the focus of attention when they appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the past month, Zhantai Liuli was undoubtedly in the limelight. However, even Zhantai Liuli had suffered from the Great Havenlaw Domain’s Mu Chen’s hands. So in the views of many, Mu Chen was probably even more troublesome to deal with than Zhantai Liuli. Thus, when such a figure made his appearance, many people would pay more attention to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen had disregarded their attention to him and had swiftly pushed his speed to the limits. He did not stop along the way and, likewise, because of Mu Chen’s infamous name and their formation, there weren’t any ignorant fools that tried to make a move on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they had passed through slightly less than half of the Fallen Battlefield in just four days, gradually arriving at the inner section of the Fallen Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to before, this region was more brutal because any force that dared to enter this section all possessed genuine strength. Even the weakest amongst them was a top force in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, despite the fact that there were very little battles that occurred here, it would be a major upheaval if one actually took place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, after entering this vast section, even Mu Chen had started to slow down their speed. They all held their guards up so that they did not get ambushed by the other forces here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inner section of the Fallen Battlefield was dark and that colour made everyone feel extremely oppressed. This land was filled with savage cracks that seemed like an abyss that pierced through the land and a darkness that seemed bottomless...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those were left behind in this battlefield from the ancient battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the black plains, a large patch of wind splitting noises rang out as a massive streak of light flew across with a terrifying pressure that even caused the heavens and earth to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood at the front of that party while squinted his eyes and looked around, before tilting his head towards Nine Nether. “How much more time till we’re at the gathering location?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to this speed, we’ll probably need two more days,” replied Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two days?” Mu Chen briefly pondered as he nodded his head. “Raise your guards… take extra precaution against the Netherworld Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether was stunned before nodding her head. Some time ago, they had received pieces of information that the Netherworld Palace was interested in their party. But due to the distance between them, there was nothing that they had to fear. But now that they were gradually entering the inner section of the Fallen Battlefield, they had to have their guards up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Netherworld Palace’s recent movements have been too frequent and ferocious. Furthermore, what’s odd is that they are searching for opponents with Battle Will genius Commanders…” Mu Chen furrowed his brows. He had vaguely felt that something was amiss. That’s because there was a focus in the Netherworld Palace’s movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, for the time being, he had no idea why the Netherworld Palace was targeting those with Battle Will geniuses Commanders and could only suppress his puzzlement. He waved his hand and continued to lead the party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when Mu Chen was about to move out, his eyes, along with the Kings, had squinted before they waved their hands, commanding the troops behind them to be on alert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They looked towards the right and saw an extremely massive force whistling over. When those forces saw Mu Chen’s party, they were briefly stunned, before they slowed their speed down. They also had their guards up as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s the Demon Gate.” Nine Nether had a keen perception, so she managed to recognise the unique mark of that huge party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of Mu Chen and the rest trembled as they brought their guards up. After all, the Demon Gate was also a peak force in the Northern Region and they had an extremely formidable formation at the moment. So if a battle broke out between them, it would definitely be a huge one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t make a move first.” Mu Chen instructed. Truth be told, he did not want to have a bad relationship with the Demon Gate. After all, the Great Havenlaw Domain did not have too big of an enmity with the Demon Gate. Furthermore, they had already offended the Divine Pavilion, Netherworld Palace and the Sky Profound Palace. So it wasn’t wise for their relationship to turn sour with the Demon Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Demon Gate’s party saw that the Great Havenlaw Domain showed no signs of attacking, they had also felt relieved. A figure flashed out and appeared before the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a beautiful silhouette donned in a red dress that outlined her bewitching curves. Her peach blossom-like face was extremely enchanting. This wasn’t a stranger to Mu Chen. It was Hong Yu of the Demon Gate, which he had previously met in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’d like to ask if Brother Mu is here?” When Hong Yu appeared before the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party, she spoke out in a gentle voice that could even cause the bones of others to turn soft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard that Hong Yu had actually asked for him, he couldn’t help being stunned, while the other Kings all had deep gazes, revealing a smile that all men knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly glanced at them, before stepping out and smiled. “Mu Chen is here. I wonder if Miss Hong Yu has anything to say with so many experts of the Demon Gate here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Yu’s gaze slightly lit up when she saw Mu Chen and bitterly smiled. “We’ve encountered something… which I’d like to ask Brother Mu for help with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Mu Chen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two days ago, we bumped into the Netherworld Palace and fought with them.” Hong Yu had a solemn expression as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen squinted his eyes. Due to the Netherworld Palace’s recent movements and them expressing their interest in him, Mu Chen had also paid attention to them as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We also have a Battle Will genius in our Demon Gate. But in the confrontation two days ago, he was defeated by Lin Ming of the Netherworld Palace…” Hong Yu clenched her teeth as she continued, “But not knowing why, when he was defeated by Lin Ming, that Battle Will genius of our Demon Gate fell unconscious. We tried many methods to wake him up, but…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyelids twitched. Lin Ming should be the Battle Will genius of the Netherworld Palace, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Mu is also a Battle Will genius, and through the event in the Death Ruin, I believe you are a Battle Formation Master now. So I’d like to ask if Brother Mu can try to examine our Battle Will genius and see if you can wake him up.” Hong Yu earnestly pleaded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled, but he did not give a response to that request and popped a question instead, “Miss Hong Yu, you should know that there are lots of schemes against one another in the Hunting War. So if I awaken your Battle Will genius, won’t I be looking for trouble in the future?”</span></p>

Our Demon Gate was schemed by the Netherworld Palace and we definitely have to settle this grudge. According to what I know, the Netherworld Palace has been looking for your traces, and I believe it’s not with good intentions. At least, based on this, don’t we have a mutual enemy?</span></p>

Perhaps you might be able to know some information about him from our injured Battle Will genius so that you can prepare yourself.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even someone with Mu Chen’s temperament couldn’t help being surprised by how witty Hong Yu was with her words. Hong Yu was truly a brilliant person, since her words had hit every point of Mu Chen’s thoughts. Furthermore, it was beneficial to the two of them, so Mu Chen had no reason to refuse this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen knew that there wasn’t an eternal alliance in the Hunting War, he could somewhat ease the relationship between them and the Demon Gate at the very least, which was beneficial to their Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, bring that person over.” Mu Chen said. He would definitely not face the other party’s troop by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Hong Yu clearly knew that Mu Chen would definitely not step forth, so she waved her hand as several silhouettes flew out from amongst her party. They all lifted a wooden board with a pale-faced man lying on it with his eyes tightly shut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at that pale-faced man and slightly furrowed his brows. Behind him, Nine Nether and the Kings had also exclaimed in a soft voice, “What’s going on? There’s nothing abnormal to the Spiritual Energy in his body…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head, then briefly hesitated, before stretching two fingers out and gently tapped on the centre of his brows. Shortly after, he suddenly squinted his eyes as a sharpness shot from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Mu, how is he?” Watching this scene, Hong Yu immediately asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly retracted his fingers and slowly said with a grave expression, “His will is already gone. In the future, he will not be able to control Battle Will anymore…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke, Mu Chen’s heart was trembling. That’s because Lin Ming of the Netherworld Palace actually possessed such an overbearing and abnormal method to destroy the will of a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Battle Formation Master, Mu Chen knew that this Battle Will genius of the Demon Gate had been completely crippled.</span></p>
