In the Spiritual Road, the Northern Spiritual Realm and the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, the reason why he was able to stand out and succeed was not because of that so-called talent of his, but sharpening himself through the dangers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li, I will definitely not be absent this time.”</span></p>

No matter how intense the pain was, he still retained a strand of consciousness. Black lightning constantly travelled through his muscles and bones as the black lightning, which was pressured by the dreadful pressure to the point that there was nowhere else to go, was forced back into his muscles and bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the intense pain continued, Mu Chen’s flesh, bones and meridians were getting stronger bit by bit under the refinement of black lightning.</span></p>

No matter how many dark horses appeared along the way, there were only four that were able to stand there in the end.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, Wu Yingying was biting her rosy lips as she had no mood. She was blankly looking at the Mirror of Judgement as if she was expecting something.</span></p>

Those two fellows are extremely powerful, and it doesn’t matter if they did it intentionally or not, it isn’t injustice for Mu Chen to fall for it.”</span></p>

Even I might not be her opponent if we fight seriously. With her present, it will not be easy for Ji Xuan and Xue Tianhe to obtain the Championship.”</span></p>

Even when he lost to Xue Tianhe earlier, she didn’t look so hurt.</span></p>

She found it a little hard to believe that this youth, who, despite being a little younger than her, was so dependable and never admits defeat, would halt his steps here.</span></p>

Fortunately, at least their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy didn’t lose completely, since Luo Li was still present.</span></p>

Since the results are already evident, are you perhaps waiting for someone to appear?” Dean Tiansheng laughed. “Furthermore, according to the rules, as long as the true Champion has yet to appear, anyone that can escape from the Mirror of Judgement can still participate as usual.”</span></p>

After all, the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament this time was extremely crucial to their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. If the Champion title falls to the Saint Spiritual Academy again, they would have the qualifications to ascend as the Academy Head, and once Dean Tiansheng held the position of Academy Head, their academy may be kicked out of the Five Great Academies with the excuse of poor results all these years.</span></p>
