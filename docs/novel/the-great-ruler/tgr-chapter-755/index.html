The Sovereign Celestial Body that was dimmed from the exhaustion once again burst forth with dazzling golden light at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, everyone could sense that the Spiritual Energy fluctuations emanated from the Sovereign Celestial Body were more powerful than before.</span></p>

The surrounding Great Havenlaw Army warriors involuntarily widened their mouths. They were extremely familiar with the Spiritual Fire Marrow, so they knew the intense burning pain one had to endure. So, generally, they would seek a quiet and safe location to refine them. They didn’t even dare to think of such a daring matter as refining it during battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, no one was confident that they could maintain their state of mind to fight while during the intense burning pain.</span></p>

No matter what, the latter’s courage was worth admiration and the crucial point was that he even succeeded…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Qing’s initially tensed expression quietly eased. The youth, Mu Chen, did have some extraordinary points for him to receive such heavy attention by the Ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, she was doubtful about whether Mu Chen could get through the Nine-Nine Blaze Dragon Array in three months time. But with such a reckless training method, the outcome might be a different one…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The robust degree of the Spiritual Energy was even more powerful than before. Clearly, after experiencing the previous battle, which exhausted his Spiritual Energy, the Spiritual Energy in his body showed signs of improvement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there was still a decent distance for him to reach Third Grade Sovereign, the degree of improvement was something that he would have had to cultivate for some time. But, right now, it only took a few hours for such improvements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more dangerous it was, the more he could unleash his potential, it was a true saying.</span></p>

He had gone through his fair share of life-and-death battles in his path, so this small Greatlaw Blaze Pond wasn’t qualified to stop his advancement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen laughed as he willed in his heart, controlling the Great Solar Undying Body to open its golden palm and a terrifyingly crushing force shot towards a Spiritual Fire Python, causing the latter to issue a sharp hissing noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

In an instant, magma splattered as Spiritual Fire Pythons were flipped, flying out. Every single golden fist would shatter a single Spiritual Fire Python every time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, those Spiritual Fire Pythons did not have any intelligence, so they weren’t afraid. On the contrary, Mu Chen’s massacre had aroused their desire to attack. A hissing roar rang out as the Spiritual Fire Pythons endlessly pounced forth, without any fear for death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden figure’s fists danced in the magma as golden light violently raged out along with Spiritual Energy. As for the magma, the ferocious Spiritual Fire Pythons endlessly pounced forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because of the massacre in this patch of magma that caused the shaking to be endless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The frantic battle here made even the warriors of the Great Havenlaw Army, who were veterans in battle, to be dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen could make use of the Spiritual Fire Marrow to recover his Spiritual Energy, he couldn’t fight endlessly. Spiritual Energy could be recovered, but the mind could not be recovered with external help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, this frantic battle lasted for an entire day, before the Great Solar Undying Body that was surrounded by Spiritual Fire Pythons, suddenly burst out. In a few flickers, it had charged out of the encirclement. Golden light flickered again as a figure hid into a cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sat down the instant he entered the cave. His face was pale and a dense exhaustion was shown on his brows. This high-degree battle had practically exhausted his mind. If it wasn’t for his will to hold on, he might have fainted long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even after he had left the battle, he could not rest, since it was the best time to train.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen waved his hand and the scarlet Spiritual Fire Marrows floated before him, before he gently held onto them. A jade bottle appeared in his hand and small transparent streams flowed out, coiling around Mu Chen. It was filled with extremely pure Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Fire Marrows and Spiritual Sovereign Liquids were prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sat with his legs crossed and swiftly formed seals, before tiringly closed his eyes slowly, entering into a state of cultivation. His mouth was slightly opened as a Spiritual Fire Marrow and a drop of Sovereign Celestial Liquid flew into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The exhausting Spiritual Energy, once again, woke up in his body and, in addition, it was more robust and refined…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scarlet magma was lifting waves every single day as a colossal golden figure that was like a robot that did not know the meaning of exhaustion, endlessly fought with the Spiritual Fire Pythons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And every single time, he would endure till his mind was at its limits, before retreating from the magma range and going into deep meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s method of training could be considered as an insanity, because even the Great Havenlaw Army, who had treated training like taking their meals, was speechless at his reckless training method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this youth might appear to be gentle on the surface, they never thought that the stubbornness and perseverance deep within his bones would be so shocking. They told themselves, after putting themselves in his shoes, that they probably could not achieve what he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so much so that even Tie Shan, Bing Qing and the remaining Commanders of the Great Havenlaw Army were inwardly astonished by Mu Chen’s performance for the past month. They sighed in their hearts. There was truly a reason why the Ruler would pay such great attention to his young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, despite his efforts being so great, his harvest for the past month wasn’t small. In just a short time of a month, the Spiritual Energy in his body had grown more robust. Although he had yet to make his breakthrough, it was a fold more robust than a month before. Furthermore, Mu Chen lasted longer in each fight every single time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the beginning, he could only last half a day after exerting all he had. And a month later, he could last for nearly two entire days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he was gradually getting used to the high temperature in the Greatlaw Blaze Pond. On the contrary, breathing in the heated atmosphere here, he felt a comfortable heat.</span></p>

It was so much so that even those that exceeded a century of lifespan that fell in Mu Chen’s hands had reached a terrifying amount of three digits.</span></p>

So they knew that it wasn’t a friendly place.</span></p>

After a month, Mu Chen realised that there weren’t anymore Spiritual Fire Pythons that could be hunted by him.</span></p>

He couldn’t find any prey, which left him helplessly pouting his lips.</span></p>

He slowly clenched his fists as he sensed the torrential Spiritual Energy fluctuations within his body. He couldn’t help grinning, but frowned shortly after, since he could sense that the growth of Spiritual Energy in his body had come to a halt. No matter how he trained in his Spiritual Energy by refining the Spiritual Fire Marrows, it could not give anymore increment in his Spiritual Energy as he did before.</span></p>

Similar ways could not let him achieve such similar results as before.</span></p>

Right now, Spiritual Fire Marrows that were a century old could no longer satisfy his training needs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wanted to break through the bottleneck, he would need an even more powerful Spiritual Fire Marrow.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the temperature of magma in the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond was extremely terrifying. Even powerful Commanders like Tie Shan and Bing Qing would not dare to casually go so deep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, it was a pity that this could not obstruct Mu Chen.</span></p>

He could sense a Spiritual Energy fluctuation over there. Bing Qing and the rest were most likely paying attention to this area. He deeply inhaled a mouthful of air and no longer hesitated. His figure moved and turned into a streak of light that charged through the surface of the magma ocean.</span></p>
