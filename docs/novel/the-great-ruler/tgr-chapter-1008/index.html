No matter how the feather flickered with golden light, it couldn’t break free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After holding onto the feather, Mu Chen’s eyes, which were still faintly dimming with golden light, looked towards Zong Tend and he slowly said, “Looks like Brother Zong is truly ruthless when you make a move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s face was extremely unsightly. He did not expect Mu Chen to recover his strength at the crucial moment. Furthermore, that fellow had stopped his golden feather with just his hand alone. One must know that the might of the feather could be comparable to a Peerless Rank Divine Artifact. If a Seventh Grade Sovereign was careless, he or she would be quickly pierced by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Zong Teng was absolutely confident that the previous Mu Chen definitely couldn’t achieve this. So he could tell that Mu Chen’s physical body had greatly improved after absorbing the essence of the Sky-Devouring Divine Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he felt an extremely great threat coming from Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truly a threat indeed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng felt extremely regretful in his heart. If he knew about this, then he would have forcefully made his move on the third level. Even if he had to pay a price, he still had to kill Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter how much he regretted this in his heart, it was pointless at this moment. Facing Mu Chen’s extremely sharp gaze, Zong Teng did not have any expression written on his face. However, his body had tensed up and he was being cautious of Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current Mu Chen was already qualified to make him feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s gaze flickered and he bent his fingers in an attempt to retrieve the feather that was grabbed by Mu Chen. With the feather in his hand, his fighting strength would slightly increase. With the current situation, it was best if he could increase his strength even by a little bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his control did not obtain any of the effect that he had expected. Although the feather in Mu Chen’s hand was constantly struggling to break free, it still did not manage to break free and was gradually being dimmed down as Mu Chen slowly increased the strength behind his grip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you have given it away, why would you take it back? Since Brother Zong is so generous, then I’ll take it.” Mu Chen gave a smile towards Zong Teng and the Spiritual Energy violently surged from his body and poured into the feather. Evidently, he was intending to take it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he was lacking a weapon and the feather was just in time for him to barely use as a weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zong Teng saw Mu Chen’s actions, he was first enraged but soon after, ridicule surged in his eyes. The golden feather was refined from the feather of the Gold Winged Roc, with the aura of the Gold Winged Roc remaining within it. It was a genuine Super Divine Beast and if it wasn’t someone of their Sky Roc Clan, they would be counterattacked by the aura of the Gold Winged Roc instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Mu Chen was too immersed in his joy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Zong Teng’s ridiculing gaze, Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy surged into the golden feather. However, his body suddenly turned stiff, as Zong Teng had expected. The golden feather violently struggled as an extremely tyrannical and massive aura vaguely emerged in an attempt to counterattack Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The aura of the Gold Winged Roc?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing the counterattack, Mu Chen’s gaze did not have any shock. He lightly smiled. Shortly after, he tightened his grip and the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos appeared on his arm. The aura of the True Dragon and Phoenix poured into the golden feather and had completely suppressed the remnant aura of the Gold Winged Roc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even as a Super Divine Beast, the remnant aura of the Gold Winged Roc was clearly inferior to the combination of the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos on Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suppressing the aura, the golden feather swiftly quieted down and the golden light retracted, turning into a golden long sword in Mu Chen’s hand. The sword was extremely bizarre. The edge of the sword was filled with densely packed sawtooth blades. It was as if there was a golden light circulating at the edge of the feather with an extremely sharp aura emitting from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A pretty good sword.” Mu Chen waved the golden longsword as he smiled with his eyes squinted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ridiculing smile on Zong Teng’s face had already disappeared when the sword, which Mu Chen held in his hand, froze. Shortly after, he was dazed as he looked at the quiet longsword in Mu Chen’s hand as disbelief filled his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen actually suppressed the aura of the Gold Winged Roc in the longsword?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that’s a Super Divine Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was Mu Chen actually a human or not?! Could it be that he had the blood of a Super Divine Beast flowing in his body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression froze as Mu Chen tossed a flavouring smile over. Raising the golden longsword in his hand, he said, “Looks like it’s time for us to settle our score.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had a smile on his face, his words were vaguely surging with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng had been finding trouble with him time and time again, trying to get rid of him and had roused the killing intent in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen finished his words, Mo Feng, who was behind Zong Teng, took several steps forth and the two of them sandwiched Zong Teng. The two of them had a sharp aura surging and Zong Teng’s face grew even more unsightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Mu Chen and Mo Feng joining together, he practically wouldn’t have any odds of winning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gentlemen, we’re only in the Body Refining Pagoda to seek for opportunities. There’s no need for us to risk our lives, is there? Furthermore, we’re only on the fourth level and if we fight with our lives on the line, I believe you guys will pay a price as well. Which I’m certain that it's a situation that neither of you is willing to see, right?” Zong Teng’s face changed, before he finally said in a solemn voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly smiled. “But I believe that forcing you out of the Body Refining Pagoda can still be easily achieved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s gaze instantly turned dark. If he was forced out of the Body Refining Pagoda, then he would lose the qualification to enter the fifth level, which would definitely be a great loss for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you want?!” Zong Teng gritted his teeth. At this moment, he had no choice but to admit defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I don’t mind letting the matter rest. It’s simple… 3,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid.” Mu Chen stretched his hand out with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s face flashed with a smear of shock and he clearly had not recover from the astonishment. He only awakened from the shock a long while later, before he immediately clenched his teeth. “3,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, why don’t you go and rob me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he was the genius of the Sky Roc Clan, 3,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was not a small sum to him, so it was impossible for him to afford it all alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then get out of the Body Refining Pagoda!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s smiling face had instantly turned cold and he coldly snorted without any courtesy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng was angered to the point that his lungs were bursting. A ferocious light flickered in his eyes, before he helplessly suppressed it a moment later and clenched his teeth. “I only have a total of 1,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid with me.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s face alternated between green and white, but he could only wave his hand, feeling his heart aching as a golden bottle flew out. The golden bottle was flickering with extremely dazzling spiritual light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen took it, he swept his perception at it before nodding his head with a smile and his eyes squinted. Zong Teng was truly somewhat rich, to bring such a huge sum of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid with him. 1,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was equivalent to half a year of income for the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Splitting the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid into two, he tossed the other half to Mo Feng and smiled. “Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Mo Feng had not helped to fight for him earlier, he might really be injured because of Zong Teng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Feng did not speak as he received it. No one would think of having too much Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, since it was essential in cultivation, so it was best to have more of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when he took the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, Mo Feng had transmitted his voice with doubt, “We’re letting him go like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had some understanding of Mu Chen’s character, since Mu Chen didn’t seem to be as friendly as he looked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t kill in the Body Refining Pagoda. If we forced him too far, the Body Refining Pagoda could immediately send him out with a single thought… And once he’s out, he would inevitably have thoughts of taking vengeance, making a move towards Nine Nether and Mo Ling. If that’s the case, then we might also be forced to leave the pagoda as well.” Mu Chen gently smiled as he continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s a situation where both sides would suffer. For the moment, there’s no need for us to give up the opportunity that lies in the fifth level. As for that fellow, we can deal with him after all this comes to an end… As for the 1,000,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, consider it an interest. Heh, if that fellow insisted on not giving them, then I wouldn’t be able to do a thing to him. After all, we can’t give up the opportunity in the fifth level…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Mo Feng’s face couldn’t help turning a little weird. Zong Teng was also a clever person, but Mo Feng never expected for him to embarrass himself from being tricked by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng had also seemed to sense the conversation between Mu Chen and Mo Feng, before his brows knitted and he finally understood what was going on. Immediately, his face turned pale and he roared, “You tricked me?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not a fool to begin with. If he was in Mu Chen’s shoes, he would definitely not let himself off. But the latter did not do as such, which meant that Mu Chen also had his worries. As long as he gave a little more effort in thinking, he would’ve been able to figure out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You reacted pretty quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen laughed with his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng also blew out from Mu Chen’s words. But fortunately, he suppressed his rage, then gave a hated glare at Mu Chen, before moving away with his teeth gritted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw his response, he no longer bothered himself with him. He could always deal with the fellow after this matter, thus his gaze shifted towards Han Shan, who stood on the side and cupped his fists together. “I have to thank Brother Han for this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he still knew what was happening when he was absorbing the essence of the Sky-Devouring Divine Beast, he was somewhat grateful for Han Shan to not make a move. Otherwise, if Han Shan made his move, then it would be a different situation by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No worries…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Shan smiled and nodded his head. “Brother Mu is truly capable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether if it was Mu Chen subduing Zong Teng’s golden feathered sword or forcing Zong Teng to hand over Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, all of it revealed that Mu Chen was an extraordinary person, which made him rejoice a little. Fortunately, he did not get blinded by greed. Otherwise, it would be an extreme headache to offend such a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen replied with a smile, then no longer spoke and raised his head towards the black stone tablet. Not knowing when, a door filled with desolation had appeared behind the stone tablet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at that door of light, Mu Chen’s calmed heart had uncontrollably surged once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that it was the passage towards the final level of the Body Refining Pagoda.</span></p>
