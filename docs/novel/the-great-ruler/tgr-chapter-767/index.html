 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the next few days, Mu Chen had made full use of the time and went into seclusion in the Nine Nether Palace. The main objective of his seclusion was to study the Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After studying it, Mu Chen also gradually realised that this was a profound and unfathomable Divine Art. Although Mandala had not told him what the level of this Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light Divine Art was, it was highly possible for this Divine Art to be a Perfect Rank Divine Art, based on his conjecture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was practically the strongest Divine Art amongst those that were possessed by Mu Chen. Even the Nine Dragons and Elephants Divine Art had not reached the level of Perfect Rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, a high-graded Divine Art meant that it would be tough to train in it as well, and the difficulty of this Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light made Mu Chen endlessly click his tongue, even with his talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with Mandala’s hidden pointers, Mu Chen barely touched the hair of it after a few days. But fortunately, he had the divine runes of a Primordial Mandala Flower in his Immortal Page. It would be of great aid for him to train in this Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light. He believed that it was just a matter of time for him to learn this Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he had great expectations in the might of this Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light upon learning it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from studying the Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light for the past few days, Mu Chen had divided his attention onto Spiritual Arrays, as well. Although he rarely used Spiritual Arrays when fighting, it was, after all, an advantage and trump card of his. And speaking from a certain angle, his talent in Spiritual Arrays even surpassed his Spiritual Energy cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, his mother was a genuine Spiritual Array Ancestor-leveled Spiritual Array Master, whose strength was something that not even Mandala could face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, Mu Chen would think that if others knew that his mother was a terrifying existence comparable to a Heavenly Sovereign, there would probably be no one on the Skylaw Continent that would dare to provoke him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this thought had also completely disappeared in Mu Chen’s mind in an instant. Not to mention that his mother was right now trapped, even with his character, he wouldn’t resort to intimidating others with his connections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inwardly sighed. It looked like the ‘powerful second generation’ was not something that he could be, even if he wanted to be, it was more reliable to rely on himself. Thus, Mu Chen would go into the Book Depository Pavilion during his free time to look for some Spiritual Arrays to train in. He had a premonition that this Dragon-Phoenix Haven would definitely be a shocking battle. With an additional means, he would have an additional chance in protecting himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing those ferocious characters on the Dragon-Phoenix Record, even Mu Chen had to pull himself together and could not afford to belittle others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala had also given Mu Chen her greatest support, allowing him to visit the Book Depository Pavilion as he wished, and allowed him to train in it as well. This special treatment made some Kings green with envy. After all, everyone knew what sort of treasures were stored in the Book Depository Pavilion. Normally, even they would not have the qualifications to enter, unless they had done a great service. However, Mu Chen could freely enter as he wished, which made them drool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, they only drooled, and no one dared to say anything about it. At this point in time, even a blind man could tell that Mu Chen and the Ruler had an extraordinary relationship. And with the support of the Ruler, no one in the Great Havenlaw Domain dared to provoke Mu Chen. Take the Blood Hawk King for example, he no longer dared to pull any tricks with Mu Chen. After all, if he made the Ruler upset, then he would probably lose his post.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Mandala opened all her resources to Mu Chen, several days had also swiftly passed by…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fifth day</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, the Nine Nether Palace was especially lively as people of various factions had gathered here. At this moment, Mu Chen was smiling as he cupped his fists with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you’re done preparing, then quickly leave. We will not be sending you off. The Dragon-Phoenix Haven is located in the Dragon-Phoenix Mountain Range in the northwest, go there yourself.” Mandala said as she waved her hand at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll be going alone?” Hearing her words, Mu Chen was stunned. Although he had been in the Northern Region for quite some time now, he had never gone far from the Great Havenlaw Domain by himself. He originally thought that this group of people from the Great Havenlaw Domain would send him off a little bit, at least to show the bearing of a peak force and intimidate those small fries a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not a kid, you need someone to accompany you?” Mandala flung her lips as she continued, “If you are not even capable of going to the Dragon-Phoenix Mountain Range by yourself, then don’t participate and be an embarrassment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was angered to the point that his teeth were itching. If it wasn’t for the fact that this little girl before him could suppress him with a wave of her hand, he might not have been able to hold himself back from teaching her a lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Domain Ruler is joking, due to the fact that only those participating in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven can enter and others that are too powerful cannot, the representative of the other forces will be going along as well. They will not be sending any experts to follow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether smiled next to him as she continued, “Therefore, you can only rely on yourself to handle whatever situation you face in this Dragon-Phoenix Haven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly sighed. It looked like he would really be going on a solo journey this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was feeling depressed and was about to move out, Mandala suddenly flicked her finger and a beam of light flew towards Mu Chen. Mu Chen caught it in his hand, it was an antique jade with strange fluctuations emitting from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you encounter any life-and-death danger, crush it.” Mandala said with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned. He had heard from Nine Nether that there should be a restriction in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, so those whose strengths have reached Mandala’s level would not be able to enter. If they were to do so, they would definitely be inflicted with a considerable trouble. But right now, Mandala had given him an antique jade, which, upon crushing it, she would rely on that fluctuation to travel through a tear of space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was the case, then she would definitely have to pay some price for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen felt touched in his heart and held onto the antique jade. He did not say a single word about it and stored it into his Universal Bracelet. It looked like he had to be more careful in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Mu Chen, although we will not be able to go to the Dragon-Phoenix Mountain Range, we will be paying attention to the situation at all times. Our Great Havenlaw Domain will wait for you to come out.” The Sky Vulture Emperor smiled from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This time, the reputation of my Great Havenlaw Domain will rely on you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen respectfully cupped his hands towards the Sky Vulture Emperor. “Lord Sky Vulture Emperor, be assured that I will definitely do my best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finishing his words, he no longer hesitated as he moved and was about to leap into the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can come back smoothly, then the seat of Great Havenlaw Domain’s Tenth King will be yours.” Mandala looked at Mu Chen as she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, then I will be thanking Lord Ruler to keep that seat for me!” Mu Chen laughed out as he moved, directly turning into a streak of light as he flew across the horizon. In a few breaths’ time, he had already disappeared from everyone’s sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at his leaving silhouette, everyone sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ruler, this Dragon-Phoenix Haven is rumoured to be the most intense one in all these years. The other peak forces have sent their younger generations that they have nurtured at all costs out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Pupils Emperor looked at the direction in which Mu Chen left, before turning towards Mandala, “After all these years, our Great Havenlaw Domain has been at a disadvantage in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, thus losing all our reputation. Although Mu Chen isn’t simple, I’m afraid that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining experts silently nodded their heads as well. They also had a genius from the younger generation partake in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. But the moment he entered, he had already been killed by the genius from the Netherworld Palace, causing a great loss to their reputation. After that, the Great Havenlaw Domain had practically given up on the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. But this time, Mandala had sent someone to participate. Although Mu Chen’s performance so far was pretty good, all those geniuses that were taking part in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven far exceeded him. They were afraid that if Mu Chen failed, their Great Havenlaw Domain would lose their reputation once again.</span></p>
