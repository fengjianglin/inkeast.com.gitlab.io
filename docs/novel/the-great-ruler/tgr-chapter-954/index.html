Even the powerful Earth Sovereigns couldn’t maintain calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, if anyone saw a Greater Earth Sovereign dying before them, it would be hard for them to maintain their calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky at this moment, the massive Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid quietly stood as the ripples gradually dissipated. But the pressure that emanated from the dark-golden pyramid still intimidated everyone, since no one dared to break the silence. The scene was as if they were afraid of provoking misfortune upon themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also shocked as he watched the scene of the Divine Pavilion Master dying and he inwardly smacked his lips. The Fourth Palace Master truly was once an Overlord of the Northern Region. His means and ruthlessness did not give any chance to the Divine Pavilion Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a formidable Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sighed. If it wasn’t for the Fourth Palace Master possessing such a powerful Saint Artifact, even if the Divine Pavilion Master was defeated today, it would be impossible for anyone to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, it wasn’t that easy to kill an Earth Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If he’s not powerful, how could he command a battle between Earth Sovereigns?” Mandala smiled. Mu Chen could tell that with the defeat of the Divine Pavilion Master, she was more relaxed. In the future, their Great Havenlaw Domain would be at the peak of their power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can we take it away?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyes flickered as he transmitted his voice over to Mandala. If their Great Havenlaw Domain could obtain such a powerful Saint Artifact, their strength would undoubtedly grow. Even if they couldn’t dominate the Northern Region, it would stabilise the Great Havenlaw Domain’s position as a heavyweight in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala heard his words, her gaze had flickered as well. Clearly, even she was tempted by such a powerful Saint Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such a Saint Artifact is truly tempting, but let’s not act carelessly. Otherwise, we might end up like the Divine Pavilion Master.” But after a brief consideration, Mandala gently shook her head. With the Divine Pavilion Master as an example, she was extremely fearful of the Fourth Palace Master. After all, no one knew whether the Fourth Palace Master still had any other cards up his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head as he swept his gaze out. The other Earth Sovereigns were also looking at the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid with greed, but they were also fearful of the Fourth Palace Master. So, despite the fact that they were drooling over it, they did not dare to make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when everyone was looking at the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid with their eyes turning red, a faint fluctuation suddenly came from the dark-golden pyramid. A silhouette gradually appeared and everyone directed their eyes over as their hearts trembled. That’s because the person that had just appeared was the Fourth Palace Master, whose Spiritual Puppet had shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Fourth Palace Master looked translucent, as if he was about to disappear. But even in such a weakened state, as the Fourth Palace Master stood in this space with his hands behind his back, the other Earth Sovereigns did not dare to make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you guys have invaded my grave, then I believe that my Ancient Haven Palace must have faded…” The Fourth Palace Master looked down at everyone as he gently sighed with a desolate voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala heard his words, she nodded. “According to history, the Lord of the Ancient Haven Palace fought with a Monarch of the Fiend Clans when the Fiend Clans invaded the Skylaw Continent. In the end, he managed to defeat the Monarch from the Fiend Clan but he had also fallen because of it. Thus, the entire Ancient Haven Palace has disappeared after that war…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Palace Master’s gaze turned darker as he muttered, “Even the Lord has fallen…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze briefly turned dark before he recovered, looking at Mandala and the Earth Sovereigns with a smile-yet-not-a-smile expression, “I believe all of you must be here for my grave, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala and the Earth Sovereigns heard his words, their expression instantly became a little awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing wrong with it. I have already fallen, so it’s right for the things that I leave behind be used by the next generations.” The Fourth Palace Master smiled as he pointed towards the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid. “All of you want this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, every single Earth Sovereign present heavily nodded their heads. Thus, one could tell how attractive the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid was for them. If they could obtain such an item, they could even retreat in safety when facing a Greater Earth Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Generally speaking, this Saint Artifact belongs to those with strength. With all your strength in the Lesser Earth Sovereign Realm, you guys are barely qualified. Therefore…” The Fourth Palace Master spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they heard the Fourth Palace Master’s words, the eyes of the few Earth Sovereigns lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing their reactions, the corner of the Fourth Palace Master lifted, then he suddenly shifted his gaze towards Mu Chen, who was standing behind Mandala, and slowly said, “Brat, you’re the one that found this Spiritual Pyramid Seal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned, until he finally understood what was going on. The Spiritual Pyramid Seal, which the Fourth Palace Master had spoken of, should be that small black metal triangle. Thus, he nodded his head in response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have hidden this thing extremely well and yet it was still found by you. Looks like we’re fated together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Palace Master’s expression eased up. “If it wasn’t for you awakening the strand of consciousness I had left behind, I’m afraid that the power of the Skyeater Evil Emperor would have been taken away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen awkwardly smiled but he did not think too much about it. At that moment, he was only trying to get the Spiritual Puppet to interfere in the situation to keep the Divine Pavilion Master under control. The reason why he could summon the Fourth Palace Master was completely blind luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter what your initial thoughts were, you have helped me once. Otherwise, there would’ve been no meaning in suppressing it for so many years.” The Fourth Palace Master seemed to have read Mu Chen’s thoughts as he smiled, “And I don’t like to owe others a favour.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the hearts of all the experts present trembled. Especially the other Earth Sovereigns, except for Mandala, who had an ill feeling. Thereafter, their breathing became hurried as they saw the Fourth Palace Master raise his hand, causing the massive Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid to swiftly shrink in size. In just a few breaths of time, it had actually turned into a palm-sized golden pyramid and fell into the hands of the Fourth Palace Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid is one of the Saint Artifacts of my Ancient Haven Palace. It was originally left behind to suppress the Skyeater Evil Emperor. But since the Skyeater Evil Emperor has already faded away, there’s no meaning in leaving this item behind. So the one fated to it can take it away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, he had quickly flicked his finger and the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid had turned into a streak of light as it entered the centre of Mu Chen’s brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starlight gradually disappeared into Mu Chen’s brows and he himself was dumbfounded. The Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain had their eyes turning red with unconcealable envy surging within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene had clearly exceeded everyone’s expectations, since no one expected that the Fourth Palace Master would give such a powerful Saint Artifact to a mere Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm like Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the latter’s strength, it was absolutely impossible for him to unleash the might of the Saint Artifact. Such an action was simply putting such a treasure to waste!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Myriad Saint Ancestor, Demon Emperor and the other Earth Sovereigns had their eyes turning red. If it wasn’t for the fact that they feared Mandala and the Fourth Palace Master, who was still present, they might have already taken action. With such a treasure, how could a Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm like Mu Chen enjoy it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid, there’s a Spiritual Divine Liquid that’s refined from that person… you can decide who to give it to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Palace Master smiled towards Mu Chen as he lazily waved his hand and his silhouette turned even thinner. “Back then, the Ancient Haven Palace must have been sealed by the Lord himself. With this Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid, you might be able to sense it…”</span></p>

If that’s the case, then he would be able to find the lost Ancient Haven Palace with the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was truly the case, then this Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid was simple too fearsome. Now that it had suddenly fallen into his hands, even someone with his composure had felt nervous. That’s because he was clear that if this news leaked out, it would definitely cause many people to be eyeing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a treasure like the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid is definitely a hot potato!</span></p>

Just when he was feeling nervous, a voice had suddenly rang out in his heart, “Brat, you have the Great Solar Undying Body. If you’re able to find the Ancient Haven Palace, if there’s sufficient opportunity, you might be able to evolve it into the Immortal Golden Body…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden voice had caused Mu Chen to be stunned as his heart trembled. He never thought that the Fourth Palace Master could sense it, despite the fact that he had never executed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Golden Body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That name had caused Mu Chen to narrow his eyes. Could it be that this Immortal Golden Body was the evolved state of the Great Solar Undying Body?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought about it, Mu Chen’s breathing had increased. After all, he had been searching for information about it for years and, finally, he had found clearer information. The Immortal Golden Body was clearly the evolved state of the Great Solar Undying Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Many thanks, Senior!” Mu Chen raised his head to look at the silhouette of the Fourth Palace Master, which was dissipating, and cupped his hands. He was grateful for the information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in response to his gratitude, the Fourth Palace Master had only faintly waved his hand, before his silhouette became even more transparent and completely disappeared under everyone’s gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Ancient Haven Palace, as ruled the entire Skylaw Continent but still dissipated into smoke… what a joke of karma…” Along with the Fourth Palace Master dissipating silhouette, his aged voice resounded within this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all the experts saw that the Fourth Palace Master had disappeared, they felt heavily relieved; before directing their red eyes onto Mu Chen like wolves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But facing their gazes, Mu Chen had disregarded them and briefly pondered before grasping his hand. The dark-golden pyramid that had appeared in his hand was passed over under Mandala’s astonished gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this was a good treasure, it’s too much of a hot potato. This thing would cause him to be a public enemy. Furthermore, with his strength at Fifth Grade Sovereign, he wouldn’t be able to use a Saint Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his hands, it would bring calamity onto him instead.</span></p>
