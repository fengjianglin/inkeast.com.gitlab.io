 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl’s clear and crisp voice resounded on this lakeside. Mu Chen, however, was stunned as he looked at the fair white hand that was stretched out towards him. After a brief moment, when he recovered from the shock, he dryly smiled. “I don’t have any.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was she joking? The Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essence was something that he gave his all and could only obtain nine drops of it. Furthermore, he even gave Nine Nether four drops after that, since it was greatly beneficial to her cultivation. So, right now, Mu Chen only have five drops left with him. But this girl that didn’t seem old was actually so ruthless with her appetite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have them?” The girl gave Mu Chen a light smile as her obsidian-like pupils flickered with light. The breathtaking beauty made even the moon dull in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at her beauty, Mu Chen’s mind was blank for a moment, as if there was a voice in his heart that demanded him to take out the Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essence by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that blankness only lasted for an instant, before the Nether Demon Heart Lightning rang out in his heart, which instantly woke him up from the blanked state. Immediately, he was startled in his heart, since the girl before him actually possessed such a natural charm with every frown and smile of hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen woke up, his figure burst in retreat in a near instant, leaving behind afterimages in the sky as his figure swiftly shot towards the forest like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Lin.” Seeing that her charm was ineffective against Mu Chen, the girl had a smear of astonishment flash on her face, before she stretched her finger out and gently flicked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the black-clothed youth heard her words, he helplessly nodded his head and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he disappeared, Mu Chen’s figure had made it into the forest. But it was only a few breaths’ time before Mu Chen’s figure appeared at the place he was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This friend, you can give up on running. It’ll be troublesome if you enrage my big sister.” The black-clothed youth appeared beside Mu Chen as he shrugged his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Staring at the mysterious black-robed youth, Mu Chen felt a chill in his heart for a long while. The strength displayed by this fellow was simply too terrifying. The difference in their strengths simply wasn’t on the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he couldn’t run anymore, Mu Chen calmed down instead. He directed his gaze at the girl and raised his hand. “I’m sorry, I only heard some commotion and so I came here. It wasn’t on purpose…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know.” The girl gently touched the seven-coloured snake on her shoulder and continued, “Otherwise, I would not be requesting just your Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Based on what?” Mu Chen clenched his teeth. Unintentionally taking a glance and the compensation for it was five drops of Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences. That was too expensive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Based on the fact that you cannot escape,” smiled the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s lips twitched as he crumbled in the end. However, he was also straightforward as he threw a jade bottle at the girl with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the girl even stretched her hand out, the seven-coloured snake that was coiled on her shoulder flew out like a bolt of lightning. It smashed the jade bottle apart with a sweep of it's tail and the five drops of Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essence flew out. Thereafter, the snake opened it's mouth, sucking in and devouring all of them in a gulp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned at this scene as he looked at the seven-coloured snake with a weird gaze. He had made an error in judgement earlier. It turned out that this seven-coloured snake is a formidable one. Within the Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences contained the will of the Primordial Fire Dragon. But, right now, it was devoured in a single gulp by it, and looking at how lively it was, it was clearly completely unaffected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although Xiao Cai is not a Divine Beast in the Great Thousand World, it isn’t any weaker than the top ranking Divine Beasts the moment it awakens.” The girl touched the smooth body of the seven-coloured snake as she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was a little shocked. This seven-coloured snake was actually not from the Great Thousand World? That meant that it was from the Lower Plane? Then, could these two people before him also be from the Lower Plane as well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After devouring the five drops of Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences, the seven-coloured snake swiftly burrowed into the sleeves of the girl and went to sleep. It seemed like it wanted to refine that energy. At the sight of this, the girl revealed a smear of a smile on her face, which was stunningly gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like the Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences are of great help to Xiao Cai.” The girl chuckled as she looked at Mu Chen. “Thanks for that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen flung his lips aside and couldn’t be bothered to speak any further. Losing five drops of Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences in the middle of the night was indeed a heartache for him. He said in a somewhat unhappy tone, “So, can I leave now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two people before him were simply too mysterious, so they mustn’t be any simple characters. Therefore, he did not want to be tangled up with them any further. One had to be more cautious when travelling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Friend, don’t be angry. Since we have met here, it means that we have a fate between us. Since you have treated Xiao Cai to eat, then we will also treat you as well.” The black-clothed youth smiled with his eyes narrowed as he embraced Mu Chen’s shoulder, acting very close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen simply wanted to vomit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was something that he had intended to use to refine his physique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need.” Mu Chen stiffly rejected, but he had belittled the passion of the black-clothed youth. The latter practically pulled him over under the tree and started roasting meat over a bonfire. Golden grease dripped and a caused splash of sparks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, eat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Mu Chen could reject, the black-clothed youth had directly shoved the roasted meat in Mu Chen’s hand and he had started to gobble down on food. That swift speed left Mu Chen stunned while looking at him. In the middle of the night, just what kind of weirdo did he encounter?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was speechless as he looked towards the sky. Shortly after, he couldn’t be bothered to think anymore. Anyhow, if the other party wanted to deal with him, there was no need for him to use any despicable means. Therefore, he also started to gobble down without any politeness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the two of them ate, the girl sat by the side with her hands supporting her cheeks. Her black obsidian-like pupils quietly stared at the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moon rose high up and, swiftly, it was a complete mess beside the bonfire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen leaned on the tree as he rubbed his tummy. It had been some time since he gorged himself. When one cultivated to a profound height, it wasn’t tough to abstain from eating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, this friend is straightforward. I am Gu Lin, this is my big sister…” the black-clothed youth wiped his mouth as he looked at Mu Chen, perfectly satisfied as he introduced himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cai Xiao.” The girl cast a glance at the black-robed youth as she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rolled his eyes, coming up with a fake name that was not at the very least real. He sighed as he answered, “I am Mu Chen, currently preparing to head for the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dragon-Phoenix Haven? I’ve been hearing that name a lot, lately.” The black-robed youth named Gu Lin scratched his head as he said in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys are not from the Northern Region?” Mu Chen was a little stunned. If it was someone from the Northern Region, it’s impossible for them to not know about the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, we’re not from the Skylaw Continent, as well. We came here because we have something to do.” Gu Lin smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. He looked at Gu Lin for a long while, but still couldn’t help popping the question, “How many years have you been cultivating?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this Gu Lin didn’t seem to be much older than him, his strength was extremely terrifying, which was a blow to Mu Chen. If the age of that fellow was as true as his appearance, then he would basically even have the heart to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Gu Lin awkwardly smiled before vaguely saying, “Don’t compare with me… I have definitely cultivated for a longer time than you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only when he heard those words did Mu Chen feel relieved. If that fellow’s appearance reflected his age, then he would practically be a monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen then shifted his gaze at the breathtaking girl with a slightly strange gaze. She should be Gu Lin’s older sister, and since Gu Lin had been cultivating for so many years, then her age must be…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thought of the girl having an old heart under that appearance of hers gave Mu Chen a slight amount of goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since she seemed to have sensed the thoughts behind his gaze, Cai Xiao couldn’t help sticking her brows together and clenched her teeth. “I’m not an old witch!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lin chuckled from her side, before moving closer to Mu Chen. “My Big Sister has a weird physique that would often go into a deep slumber. Therefore, she is as old as her appearance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen awkwardly smiled. Although he was curious why she would have such an abnormal physique, he was inexperienced, after all, so that question of his was too offending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cao Xiao, however, stared at Mu Chen and suddenly asked, “It’s said that there’s the blood essence of the True Dragon in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her question, Mu Chen then understood that they had no knowledge about the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Thus, on the spot, he informed the two of them about the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So there’s the blood essence of the True Dragon.” Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Cao Xiao’s pupils slightly flashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing her reaction, Gu Lin’s heart immediately jumped as he immediately said, “Big Sister, we did not come out for the Dragon-Phoenix Haven this time. We have yet to even complete the task given to us by father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can do the task, I have decided to go to the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. If I can obtain the blood essences of a True Dragon, then Xiao Cai can undergo a complete evolution. I will also have no need to go into a deep slumber.” Cai Xiao casually said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah?!” Gu Lin immediately exclaimed, “You want to go alone?! That cannot be done. Father has mentioned that you cannot act alone! If he finds out about this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He will not if you do not speak about it.” Cai Xiao gave Gu Lin a light smile, before rising her fist up at him. “Do you not know the consequences of disobeying me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister, you can’t do this!” Gu Lin howled with grief. If he knew earlier, he wouldn’t have treated that fellow to a meal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen paid no attention to their conversation and pretended that he had seen nothing. Thereafter, he rubbed his nose and was prepared to leave. He felt that it was still better to leave these two as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, before he could even open his mouth to bid them farewell, Cai Xiao had directed her charming gaze over and smiled. “Then, I will have to trouble you to bring me to the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s body instantly turned stiff as he looked at the nearby Gu Lin, who was spewing flames from his eyes. He finally understood the meaning of ‘lifting the boulder and smash his own feet’.</span></p>
