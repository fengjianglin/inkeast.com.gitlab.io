 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Arm Sovereign’s evaluation indifferently resounded in the sky, covering all the discussions and had instantly silenced the entire plaza.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people had weird gazes, especially the veterans of the Great Havenlaw Domain, they were even displeased. The Dragon Arm Sovereign was powerful with a resounding reputation, but Mu Chen had great contributions. The Domain Ruler might not have even been able to break through to the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm if it wasn’t for Mu Chen. If it wasn’t for him, the Divine Pavilion might have prevailed and they would have perished from the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His contributions were equivalent to a favour to everyone in the Great Havenlaw Domain. In the past, even the Three Emperors would not scoff at Mu Chen and remain courteous, unlike the Dragon Arm Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So they already felt displeased at the Dragon Arm Sovereign before Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dragon Arm Sovereign, you’re just a newcomer in our Great Havenlaw Domain, despite your reputation in the Northern Region. You’ve joined us because of how powerful we are right now, don’t forget that this was also due to Mu Chen’s contributions.” The Asura King, who was displeased by the two of them, spoke out first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. There is always a first come, first served basis for everything. Trying to depend on your seniority is useless here.” The Mountain Splitting King also grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other veteran Kings also resounded their opinions, while the new batch of Kings exchanged looks. They did not join the dispute, fearing that they would offend the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku. After all, the two of them would ascend to Emperors, pillars of the Great Havenlaw Domain after today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku saw that the veteran Kings had lashed out at them, they were stunned, before their faces turned unsightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As experts of the Northern Region that had built their reputations long ago, they were naturally prideful and aloof. They had never thought highly of Mu Chen, so they would never be courteous to him. After all, Mu Chen was too young. They naturally had disdain for him, since he was only sheltered by the Domain Ruler due to his great contributions in the Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So the Dragon Arm Sovereign ridiculed him when he saw that Mu Chen showed up with the intentions of competing for the Emperor position with them. But as a result, he had underestimated Mu Chen’s reputation in the Great Havenlaw Domain. The moment he spoke his ridicules, it was akin to poking through a hornet’s nest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before the two of them could speak up, the Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupil Emperor’s words had already resounded, “King Mu and Nine Nether King have great merit in our Great Havenlaw Domain. Before the two of you are promoted, your positions are the same as them. So we hope that the two of you will refrain from such rudeness.”’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Emperors already had an opinion about the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku, to begin with. So when the two Emperors saw that the two of them were targeted by the veterans, they naturally threw stones at them, who had fallen down a well, without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the dozing Sleeping Emperor had an eye-narrowing smile as he nodded his head towards the upbraid of the Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupil Emperor to express to his agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The countenances of the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku alternated between white and green. They never expected that a single sentence would cause such public rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, it was normal for them to criticise someone younger than them with their strength and reputation. But who could have expected that the situation would turn out this way…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They exchanged a look with ugly expressions, before looking at the throne Mandala was on. They wanted to latter to say something, but at this moment, Mandala still looked like she was nodding off to sleep without any signs of speaking up, nor did she stop the Sky Vulture Emperor and the rest from speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku sunk when they saw Mandala’s attitude. They had far underestimated Mu Chen. Evidently, in Mandala’s heart, they weighed even less than Mu Chen, since she showed no support for them, despite being a public target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they felt displeased in their hearts, they managed to suppress it, before raising their heads and looked at Mu Chen and Nine Nether in the sky, and forced a smile. “I was careless with my remark, I hope that King Mu does not take it to heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how much displeasure they felt in their hearts at this moment, they could only swallow it down, fearing that they would attract more criticism and embarrass themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also stunned when he saw this situation in the sky, before shaking his head with a smile on his face. The current Great Havenlaw Domain was more interesting and, at the same time, more chaotic. The Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku should have already caused much displeasure in them and this matter was just an ignition point to blow up the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What unfortunate fellows…” Mu Chen muttered in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shook his head and smiled before saying, “Since the Domain Ruler has already said that anyone can challenge for the two Emperor positions. I wonder if the two of us can participate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala opened her eyes and looked at Mu Chen with a sly smile on her exquisite face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone as powerful as her could naturally sense Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s strengths, despite the fact that they had concealed their Spiritual Energy fluctuations and nodded her head. “You can.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An uproar arose, but this time, even the veteran Kings had knitted their brows. They never expect that Mu Chen and Nine Nether would really be vying for the Emperor positions with the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them were at the Initial Phase of Ninth Grade Sovereign, even Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupil Emperor were on an equal level as them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s strengths must have increased after their year-long trip, Nine Nether was only barely a Seventh Grade Sovereign while Mu Chen was a Sixth. Even if they have improved, a single grade should be the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even so, their odds of success were practically zero against the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light flashed in the eyes of the Dragon Arm Sovereign and Oldman Ku, but they did not speak. Only the corner of their lips rose into mocking smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the reputation that Mu Chen and Nine Nether possessed in the Great Havenlaw Domain, the two of them would be helpless to find their face again through normal means. But since the two of them insisted on going against them, then it would be the same as them courting their embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They wished to see how many times they could embarrass themselves after being defeated by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Mu, Nine Nether King, the two of you must think through this matter carefully.” The Sky Vulture Emperor reminded with a solemn expression. The two of them could sense that the Spiritual Energy fluctuations around Mu Chen and Nine Nether were a little cryptic, but they did not consider it much, nor did they think that both of their strengths would undergo a great surge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks for the reminder, Sky Vulture Emperor.” Mu Chen replied with a smile but showed no intention of backing off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doubt flashed in the eyes of the Sky Vulture Emperor when heard the confidence in Mu Chen’s words. Based on his understanding of Mu Chen, Mu Chen had a steady character despite his young age. So he wouldn’t risk his life if it wasn’t something he was confident in.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Can it be that Mu Chen has obtained a powerful means that could confront against an Initial Phase Ninth Grade Sovereign?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Recalling Mu Chen’s powerful trump cards as a Spiritual Array Master and Battle Formation Master, his worries loosened up a little. He hoped that Mu Chen could achieve it or he would just be embarrassing both himself and the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Since the two of you insist on this, then I can only go bully the young one at a time…” Oldman Ku laughed out in a hoarse voice, before he disappeared and appeared on a stone stage in the plaza, then looked at Mu Chen and Nine Nether with ridicule in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder which one of you will challenge me? If I lose, I will definitely not dwindle on the Emperor position.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes were looking at Mu Chen and Nine Nether with expectation in their eyes. Some of them were puzzled and some of them was naturally rejoicing in their misfortune.</span></p>
