 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The commotion gradually tuned down from the numerous shh-ing noises. Every single expert in the Great Havenlaw Domain sighed, since no one had expected for Mu Chen, a Third Grade Sovereign, to be the biggest winner in this King’s Ceremony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Envy and shock were filled in those sighs. But there wasn’t any more contempt because the strength that Mu Chen had displayed on the King’s Ceremony Stage had left every single expert of the Great Havenlaw Domain shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His cultivation to Fourth Grade Sovereign, and adding on the other identity of an Earth-Grade Spiritual Array Grandmaster, was equivalent to a Fifth Grade Sovereign. Even amongst the Great Havenlaw Domain that was filled with experts, he could be considered an outstanding elite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, despite many people being envious by the fact that Mu Chen could become the tenth King, no one felt unsatisfied by it. After all, strength was the key in many places, and the strength that was displayed by Mu Chen deserved to be acknowledged and respected by the experts in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was no longer the Sovereign Realm newbie from a year ago when he just entered the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the current Nine Nether Palace that was behind Mu Chen couldn’t be viewed as it was in the past. In the past, the Nine Nether Palace was the weakest force amongst the Nine Kings, thus suffering many contempts. But, in the past year, the Nine Nether Palace powerfully rose with a reputation of gradually growing stronger. The most crucial point was that right now, the Nine Nether Palace was the only force in the Great Havenlaw Domain with two Kings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That meant that the resources that the Nine Nether Palace would receive would be double that of the other King forces. Under the support of such vast resources, it went without saying that the Nine Nether Palace would grow stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps, in the future, the situation of the strongest force in the Great Havenlaw Domain would change… Therefore, it was evidently foolish to offend Mu Chen and the Nine Nether Palace right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this King’s Ceremony, aside from Mu Chen becoming the biggest winner, the Greatlaw City’s City Lord, Qin Zhong had gotten quite a bit of benefit as well. Although he was not bestowed with the title of King, after seeing his contributions for the Great Havenlaw Domain, Mandala promised to help him break through to Fifth Grade Sovereign. As long as he managed to break through to Fifth Grade Sovereign, he would become the eleventh King in the Great Havenlaw Domain after the Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This grace had undoubtedly made Qin Zhong extremely excited. Although many others were envious of him, Mandala had also clearly stated that in this Hunting War, there would be rewards for contributors. Furthermore, the rewards were something that even the various Kings were tempted by, not to mention the other experts. Thus, the atmosphere in the entire Great Havenlaw Domain was roused up with soaring fighting intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this situation, Mu Chen also couldn’t help inwardly smacking his lips. Mandala was truly skilled in managing her subordinates. She was, indeed, worthy as the only Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the King’s Ceremony came to an end, Mu Chen stayed in the Nine Nether Palace to quietly cultivate and stabilize the chaotic Spiritual Energy from his breakthrough to Fourth Grade Sovereign. In addition, his remaining energy was spent on training the Nine Nether Troops. With the Hunting War approaching, Mu Chen could sense the atmosphere in the Great Havenlaw Domain gradually getting tense and solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although their Great Havenlaw Domain was a peak force in the Northern Region, there would be peak forces being destroyed and devoured by the other peak forces in every Hunting War. The experts in those forces could only flee for their lives or join other forces. But that sort of failure would be mocked, no matter where they went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the Hunting War was directly concerning themselves. So, as to not become stray dogs, they had to give it their all so that the Great Havenlaw Domain could survive the Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the entire Great Havenlaw Domain was in preparation for war in this period of time, enveloped in an oppressed and tensed atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Palace was, naturally, not spared from that atmosphere. Although Mu Chen was bestowed the title of King, the Nine Nether Troop was still under his control. With the expansion of the Nine Nether Troop in the past year, the scale of it had increased several folds. In addition to the ample cultivation resources that the Nine Nether Palace was entitled to, the Nine Nether Troop could be considered as a powerful army with a strength several times stronger than a year ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Mu Chen’s speculations, he might have to borrow the strength of the Nine Nether Troop in this Hunting War. Therefore, he could not afford to relax, since he needed to be coordinated with this troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether Palace, in a vast training field</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Troop, which was enveloped in black armour, was training in the field. All of them were quietly sitting as a pitch-black Battle Will surged from their bodies and gathered above them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle Will looked like a black surging ocean that was filled with roars that caused the entire region to faintly tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the front of the Nine Nether Troop, Mu Chen sat on a lion statue with his hands joined together. Light faintly flickered in his eyes as Spiritual Energy gushed out of his body, soaring into the vast ocean of Battle Will above the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen would need the Battle Will of the Nine Nether Troop to accept him if he wanted to control it, so his Spiritual Energy wandered within the vast Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Mu Chen’s coordination with the Nine Nether Troop was pretty good. But due to this period of time, when he was busy with the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, the King’s Ceremony and the expansion of the Nine Nether Troop, the coordination between them had lacked behind. Now that he had the time, he naturally had to put in the time to fix the coordination with the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen spent two hours nurturing the coordination between them before he opened his eyes and looked at the Nine Nether Troop, which was like a black ocean with dense black clouds of Battle Will above them. Vaguely, there were hissing noises that came from them, which sounded like lightning that would strike fear in the hearts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the strength of a single warrior in the Nine Nether Troop wasn’t anything to fear in Mu Chen’s eyes, he would feel slightly pressured if their Battle Will had gathered together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Mu Chen’s speculations, if he could control the Battle Will of the Nine Nether Troop with his cultivation at Fourth Grade Sovereign, he could even easily suppress Fifth Grade Sovereign veterans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although the Nine Nether Troop is powerful, it’s still too lacking compared to the Great Havenlaw Army.” Mu Chen sighed as he looked at the Nine Nether Troop. Despite the strength of the Nine Nether Troop having been constantly rising, there was still a huge gap between them and the strongest army in the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Great Havenlaw Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But due to the fact that the Great Havenlaw Army was too powerful, Mu Chen knew that it wasn’t an easy task to control the Battle Will of the Great Havenlaw Army. Furthermore, Mu Chen guessed that not even the Great Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army, Huo Mei’er could fully control the Battle Will of the Great Havenlaw Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were nearly a thousand people in the Great Havenlaw Army, and every single one of them had their strength in the Sovereign Realm. If such a dreadful Battle Will could be controlled, probably only Mandala and the Three Emperors could confront them in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Hunting War is probably the place where those troops are put to use.” Mu Chen muttered to himself. In the Hunting War, the strength of an individual was greatly inadequate, unless one was as strong as the Three Emperors. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to control the situation. Thus, they would have to rely on the power of troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like the Hunting War will not be easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help sighing as he looked out of the Nine Nether Palace. With the Hunting War approaching, he could clearly sense the changes in atmosphere in the entire Great Havenlaw Domain. The troops of the various Kings had been training every day and the killing aura could be felt from so far away. It was so much so that even Nine Nether had started to seclude herself in cultivation, leaving the affairs of the Nine Nether Palace to him. But, fortunately, without a housekeeper like Tang Bing, even he would have the thoughts of escaping from here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But from this, he could judge how brutal the Hunting War was. Even their Great Havenlaw Domain was in great danger, since no one could guarantee that the Great Havenlaw Domain would remain in the Northern Region after this Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about this matter, Mu Chen’s heart felt a lot more heavy. Although there were people that he didn’t like, the shelter that it provided him had allowed Mu Chen’s strength to soar in the past year. Thus, he was grateful to the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention that Mandala was the Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain, and Mu Chen had quite a bit of a favourable opinion about that two-faced little queen that was cute on the outside but possessed absolute strength. After all, Mandala had given him quite a bit of help in the past year. The crucial part was that Mandala had never treated him as a subordinate, the relationship between the both of them had exceeded their status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, it would be hard for Mu Chen to accept if the Great Havenlaw Domain was to be defeated and devoured by others in this Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like I can only give it my all to do my part.” Mu Chen bitterly smiled.
