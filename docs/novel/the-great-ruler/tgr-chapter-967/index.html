Unconcealable joy was surging in his eyes as he tightly held onto the scrolls and murmured, “Heaven Grade Spiritual Array…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Heaven Grade Spiritual Array was low-ranked, even a Seventh Grade Sovereign would be heavily injured by it.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s enough.”</span></p>

With his current strength, it’s a little forceful even for him to lay out a Low Rank Heaven Grade Spiritual Array and he even needed to gain some comprehension from them if he really wanted to lay out the Spiritual Arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, even if Mandala found a Middle Rank or High Rank Heaven Grade Spiritual Array, it’s impossible for him to set it up.</span></p>

When I purchase it, it had exceeded the price of the other Heaven Grade Spiritual Array by a fold.” Mandala looked at the utmost left scroll in Mu Chen’s palm as she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyes flickered, since he knew that Mandala was speaking about the God Annihilation Array. After skimming through the information in his mind, his eyes had suddenly contracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This God Annihilation Array is not complete…” Mu Chen said slowly as the light flickering in his eyes grew even more intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is an Ancient Spiritual Scroll from the primordial times. There’s a total of three scrolls and the God Annihilation Array is one of them. If you can gather all three scrolls, you can even kill a Greater Earth Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three Emperors heard her words, a smear of shock flashed on their faces. A Spiritual Array that could slaughter a Greater Earth Sovereign Realm, could it be the legendary Scholar Array?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But it’s a pity… that this God Annihilation Array is the weakest amongst the three of them, and thus, it was spread around. But the two other scrolls are extremely rare, so the chances of gathering them won’t be high.” Mu Chen shook his head as he somewhat felt pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If you could gather the three scrolls, then the price of it wouldn’t be any inferior to the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid. After all, Scholar Grade Spiritual Arrays were extremely tempting to Spiritual Array Scholars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But even if it’s the weakest amongst the three scrolls, the power of it is stronger than ordinary Low Rank Heaven Grade Spiritual Arrays. It’s no wonder why the price of it is so high, it’s simply worth it.” Mu Chen smiled. It looked like he had to thoroughly study and comprehend this God Annihilation Array. With this array, it’d definitely be a pretty good killer move. But if that’s the case, then he would be somewhat confident in going to the Divine Beast Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had quite a bit confidence in himself through this breakthrough. With his current strength, even if he didn’t use any Spiritual Array, dealing with Liu Qing wouldn’t be a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s still half a month till the two months deadline is up. So you can cultivate for another ten days, we will head for the Nine Netherbird Clan after that!” said Mandala.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. Since he had just broken through, he, indeed, needed several days to get used to the growth of strength in his body. At the same time, he needed to comprehend the Spiritual Arrays in order to set them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a decision, Mu Chen no longer delayed and his figure moved, flying towards the Nine Nether Palace like a streak of light, and entered in the serene depths of the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the next half a month, Mu Chen did not take a step out of the Nine Nether Palace and had spent all his time on sensing the Spiritual Energy in his body and comprehending the Heaven Grade Spiritual Arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the process of comprehending the Heaven Grade Spiritual Arrays, Mu Chen had also gradually tried to set up the arrays. But at the start, his attempts had all ended up in failure, causing violent Spiritual Energy shock wave to explode in the depths of the Nine Nether Palace from each of his failures. This caused many experts in the Nine Nether Palace to be fearful, since they could sense the Spiritual Energy explosion was something that not even Sixth Grade Sovereigns could withstand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this string of failures lasted for ten days, before they started to decrease and the explosions from the arrays were only in small amounts. During the last one or two days, the explosions had completely disappeared. At the same time, a torrential Spiritual Energy soared into the sky in the depths of the Nine Nether Palace and a spiritual light blossomed in every direction. There seemed to be a something terrifying brewing within…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The changes had caused the experts of the Nine Nether Palace to be fearful and many of them looked towards the depths of the Nine Nether Palace. But as they felt fearful, the thing that was brewing did not seem to explode but had quietly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts exchanged looks from this situation and they could only think of it as Mu Chen’s failure once again as they sighed in pity…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As everyone was feeling pity regarding this matter, Mu Chen stood at a courtyard in the depths of the Nine Nether Palace with his hands behind his back, looking at the Spiritual Energy undulations that were gradually dissipating. His gaze lightly flickered as he smiled. Judging from his looks, there wasn’t any dismay of failure, but a smear of insight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Heaven Grade Spiritual Array…” Mu Chen lowered his head as he looked at his fair hands and gently smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After attempting for nearly half a month, despite the numerous failures, Mu Chen had also started to experience the power of the Heaven Grade Spiritual Array for himself, it was far stronger than any Earth Grade Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had not wasted his effort to search for opportunity in midst of failures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mu Chen sighed in his heart, fine footsteps resounded from outside the courtyard and he immediately smiled. Before they could even speak, he had already called out, “Come in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two silhouettes that walked into the courtyard were naturally the two sisters, Tang Bing and Tang Rou. Tang Bing had taken up the task to manage the Nine Nether Palace and her position was just lower than Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s. Despite being in such a high position, it had given her an aloof atmosphere, since she was initially icy and arrogant.</span></p>

Her face had still turned red after seeing Mu Chen’s smile and looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Were you trying to tear our Nine Nether Palace apart over the past few days…?” Tang Bing had directly rolled her eyes towards Mu Chen when she walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Tang Bing, who was extremely serious when handling official matters, Mu Chen could only dryly smile. Although he already had a high position in the Great Havenlaw Domain, he had sincerely treated the two sisters as friends, so he would naturally not be oppressive like how he was with others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Domain Ruler called us to inform you to prepare to head for the Nine Netherbird Clan tomorrow.” Tang Bing was direct and efficient when handling official matters and spoke about the serious matter.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing bit on her rosy lips and the aloof look on her face had already gradually disappeared, before she stared at Mu Chen and softly said, “Can Big Sister Nine Nether still come back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Palace was set up by Nine Nether alone and they were guided by Nine Nether as well. Thus, they had treated the Nine Nether Palace as their home. But they knew that if Nine Nether had truly left the Nine Nether Palace, even if Mu Chen could hold up the fort, there would be a feeling missing in this place…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at Tang Bing, who had a depressed expression, whereas Tang Rou’s eyes had already turned red and she sunk into silence. It must’ve been a great blow to them after Nine Nether’s departure. However, they did not usually reveal their worries, but now that Mu Chen was about to leave as well, they showed their real feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the two sisters, Mu Chen gently patted them on their shoulders and a gentle smile appeared on his handsome face. “Rest assured, I will bring Nine Nether back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Tang Bing and Tang Rou saw the smile on Mu Chen’s face, despite the latter having a gentle expression, they could sense the trace of resolution in his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the two sisters had smiled and they heavily nodded their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, bring this with you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing suddenly removed a light bracelet from her wrist and passed it over to Mu Chen, “There are 1,500,000 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid here, it’s something that I have been doing my best to gather. I hope that it should be some help to you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the bracelet and was somewhat startled. He clearly knew how competent Tang Bing was as a housekeeper, and all usage of the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid in the Nine Nether Palace was within her calculations, which was precisely why the Nine Nether Palace could gradually expand and operate healthily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, it would’ve been extremely tough for Mu Chen to obtain Sovereign Spiritual Liquid from her. So when he saw her giving him such a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, he couldn’t help feeling startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the Nine Nether Palace lost both you and Big Sister Nine Nether, then what’s the point of us having all this Sovereign Spiritual Liquid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing seemed to know what Mu Chen was thinking. She pursed her lips before staring at Mu Chen. “Don’t think that I’m unaware of you calling me a miser secretly so many times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled but he did not reject her offer. That’s because this sum of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was extremely important to him. When he stored the bracelet, his voice resounded once again, “I will definitely bring her back, I promise!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We believe you… and… you… you have to be careful, too.” The one that spoke out was the shy Tang Rou as she stared at Mu Chen with her big eyes filled with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen took a deep breath in as he slowly raised his head and looked in the direction that Nine Nether had previously left in before clenching his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether, looks like I can’t listen to you this time. I will definitely go to the Nine Netherbird Clan!</span></p>
