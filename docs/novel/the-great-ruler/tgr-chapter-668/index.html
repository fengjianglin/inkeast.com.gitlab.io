 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing before the palace, Nine Nether’s face was frosted cold as anger spewed from her eyes. Evidently, she had been thoroughly angered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing next to her, Mu Chen had also furrowed his brows.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like this Blood Hawk King isn’t anyone good. The things that he did have made others hold him in contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s ample chest was gently heaving as she calmed herself down from her rage shortly after. Her voice gradually returned back normal, but the chill in her tone could not be concealed, “From today onwards, we will take back the quota of our Nine Nether Palace. I will make a trip to the Nine Kings Conference and let them know that I, Nine Nether, has returned. I’ll see who dares to hinder our Nine Nether Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will let them all return the things belonging to my Nine Nether Palace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing and Tang Rou nodded their heads, there was joy in their eyes. Now that Nine Nether had successfully gone through her Tribulation, her strength grew and she wasn’t any weaker than the eight other kings. Their Nine Nether Palace finally had someone to depend on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Bing’er, right now in the Great Havenlaw Domain, how many Domain Lords are qualified to compete for the quota of the Greatlaw Goldpond?” Nine Nether looked at Tang Bing and asked. If Mu Chen wished to enter the Greatlaw Goldpond, then he would have to defeat those competitors. Thus, she had to let Mu Chen know beforehand how powerful</span><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">his opponents were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing cast a glance at Mu Chen, who was standing beside Nine Nether. Her eyes were beautiful. When her eyes were cold, there was a feeling of casting others a thousand miles away from her. But now, there were other emotions in her eyes. Her pair of pretty eyes became more spirited, there was a faint allure in them that made them even more charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there was still some doubts in the gaze she used to look at Mu Chen. She felt pressure coming from him, but compared to those famous Domain Lords in the Great Havenlaw Domain, there still seemed to be some distance between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She honestly doubted whether Mu Chen possessed the qualifications to compete with those genius Domain Lords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, in the end, her doubt was still doubted as she honestly replied, “Right now, there are a total of eighteen Domain Lords, all who are under the other eight Kings. We did have one in the past, but right now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one that she was talking about would naturally be Cao Feng, who had left the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether lightly nodded her head, while having a calm expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Along the eighteen Domain Lords, there are four whose fame is the biggest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The head of the Four Great Domain Lords is Xu Qing, under the Asura King. Right now, he is already the Second Grade Sovereign. I believe that Big Sister Nine Nether might have some impression of him.” Tang Bing said as she smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xu Qing?” Hearing that name, Nine Nether was stunned for a brief moment, before continuing to speak with astonishment, “I never thought that the unremarkable brat back then would become so powerful now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, Big Sister Nine Nether, rumour has it that Xu Qing has always been in love with you. All these years, many outstanding girls showed their affection for him. But not once was his heart shaken.” Tang Rou covered her mouth as she laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether gently flicked Tang Rou’s forehead. “Rubbish, I don’t talk to him much… Xiao Bing’er, you carry on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The second of the Four Great Domain Lords would be Zhou Yue, under the Mountain Splitting King.” Tang Bing’s voice paused for a brief moment as she continued, “The third would be Wu Tian, under the Blood Hawk King. He was brought back by Blood Hawk King a few years ago. In just a few years time, this Wu Tian had become one of the Four Great Domain Lords, his rapid promotion shocked others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether nodded her head, “What about the fourth?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing’s rosy lips finally moved, but she still spoke in a soft voice in the end, “The fourth is also under the Blood Hawk King…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether narrowed her eyes as she faintly said, “Cao Feng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing lightly nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like he has found the right backing, to climb to such a height in just a few years time.” Nine Nether said calmly. That youth did possess the talent. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have pushed him as the Commander of the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three of the Four Great Domain Lords all have the strength of Second Grade Sovereign. As for Cao Feng, he is already at the peak of the First Grade Sovereign, and could ascend to Second Grade at anytime. Thus, almost no one was an opponent for him amongst the First Grade Sovereigns.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing cast a glance at Mu Chen as she continued, “There are only four quotas for the Greatlaw Goldpond, so if he wants to obtain one of them, he would have to defeat one of the Four Great Domain Lords.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. The meaning behind Tang Bing’s words were clear enough. Amongst the Four Great Domain Lords, Cao Feng was the weakest. Thus, if he wished to obtain the qualification for the Greatlaw Goldpond, he would have to defeat this Cao Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Tang Bing clearly did not feel that Mu Chen could achieve it. Although she hated that fellow, Cao Feng did have the capability, since he could climb his way to the Four Great Domain Lords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Are you not confident? If you don’t have the confidence, then we will give up this time.” Nine Nether turned her head as she gave Mu Chen a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was apparently a small smear of expectation in the depths of Nine Nether’s eyes as he looked at her. At this time, if he said that he wasn’t confident, she would probably be disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although I have no concept of how powerful these Four Great Domain Lords are… I have never feared an Earth Sovereign, not to mention some Second Grade Sovereigns.” Mu Chen laughed with a smear of a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, our Nine Nether Palace will definitely have a spot in the Greatlaw Goldpond.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether lightly lifted her brows and did not speak. However, she couldn’t hide the smile surfacing on her face. Tang Rou was also a little surprised when she saw how confident Mu Chen was. Tang Bing, however, was judging him as she looked at Mu Chen.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His courage is indeed worth praising, but… the qualification of the Greatlaw Goldpond isn’t something that could be obtained solely with courage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether did not speak anything as she turned around and entered the palace. Upon entering the palace, she stopped her steps and said with a soft tone, “Since you have already said so, then no matter how hard it would be to get the qualifications of participation, I will surely get it for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she finished speaking, she strode into the palace. Tang Rou cast a surprised glance at Mu Chen as she followed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen leaned on the pillar as he looked at Nine Nether’s leaving silhouette and lightly smiled. There were emotions in his eyes. Ever since they left the Northern Heavens Continent, Nine Nether had been planning things out for him, since she knew his own target. Thus, she was doing all she could to pave the way for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a path towards being the supreme expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like Big Sister Nine Nether treats you pretty well.” Tang Bing stood close by as her gaze returned to being cold, staring at Mu Chen. She was tugging her chest. Even if her training outfit was somewhat loose, her actions still outlined her ample bosom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is your relationship with Big Sister Nine Nether?” Tang Bing looked at Mu Chen. For all these years, she had been the one managing the Nine Nether Palace. Thus, she somewhat had a dignified manner. There was also a little forcefulness in her gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her gaze clearly wasn’t too effective on Mu Chen. He gave Tang Bing a smile. “Even if I risk being gravely injured, I will not let anything happen to her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right…” Mu Chen did not continue on further and changed topic, “Big Sister Tang Bing, is it a little troublesome for Nine Nether to get that quota of the Commander back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are only nine Kings in the Great Havenlaw. Every single King has a quota of the Commander. Blood Hawk King seized our quota, taking the benefits for all these years. You think he will hand it back so easily?” Tang Bing spoke with her brows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although Big Sister Nine Nether has the support of the Sky Vulture Emperor, the Sky Vulture Emperor doesn’t have the final say in the Great Havenlaw. Otherwise, our Nine Nether Palace wouldn’t be so miserable in the recent years…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, I’m afraid that the Nine Kings conference might not be too calm.” Tang Bing paused her voice as she looked at Mu Chen. “Big Sister Nine Nether treats you very well, I hope that you will not become a second Cao Feng. Otherwise, even if Big Sister Nine Nether doesn’t stop you, I will definitely not let you off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rubbed his nose and smiled, “Big Sister Tang Bing is rather beautiful when you threaten someone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing couldn’t help widening her eyes a little at this time as she looked at the smiling youth with a bit of indignance. This fellow… when she was earnestly talking to him, he was actually teasing her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, everyone in the Nine Nether Palace feared her because of her seriousness and strictness. No one dared to speak this way to her, so when Mu Chen teased her, she was actually stunned for a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, Big Sister Tang Bing. This Cao Feng…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly spat a mouthful of air out. Just when Tang Bing was lightly frowning her brows, there was a chill in his faint smile. “I will definitely not let him off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although, on the surface, Nine Nether didn’t look to be too affected by Cao Feng’s betrayal, Mu Chen could see the sadness in the depths of her eyes. She must not have felt good about Cao Feng’s betrayal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing was stunned as she looked at Mu Chen and hesitated for a brief moment. “It’s good if you have the heart. Cao Feng isn’t a simple figure, it’s best that you be cautious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head as he looked around, “Big Sister Tang Bing, why don’t you show me around. In the future, I will also be someone of the Nine Nether Palace, I have to get used to the area.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing cast an unhappy look at him, but she did not reject. She turned around and left, with Mu Chen following her, smiling.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it was still morning, many people were waiting before the Nine Nether Palace. The shut doors of the palace slowly opened up as a slender figure strode out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure was donned in black armour that tightly outlined her exquisite figure, displaying her wonderful curves. On the armour were runes of a soaring blackbird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure was naturally Nine Nether, but today, she was more valiant and formidable-looking compared to the past. Her long hair fluttered with a trace of prestige between her brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We welcome the King!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing before the Nine Nether Palace, were the thousands of people with one knee on the ground. Orderly voices, along with excitement, rang from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether looked around as she lightly nodded her head. Behind her stood</span><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, Tang Bing and Tang Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, I have not seen those fellows for years. We will go tell them to return those that they have seized from our Nine Nether Palace, obediently!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A chill surged in Nine Nether’s gaze as she waved her hand. Her figure turned into a streak of light as Mu Chen, Tang Bing and Tang Rou followed behind, boiling with baleful auras.</span></p>
