But at this moment, an extremely huge undulation had appeared in this army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An alliance army that was also terrifying in numbers was madly tearing apart the defence of the zombie army with powerful Battle Wills sweeping out, turning the innumerable zombie warriors ahead of them into ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was naturally the allied forces, with the Divine Pavilion as the spearhead.</span></p>

The allied forces was like a tidal wave that tore the defences open and charged in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Charging their way through, they swiftly made their way towards the depths of the zombie army.</span></p>

That’s because he knew that this smoothness couldn’t last forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the outer defences of the zombie army weren’t that easy to deal with. Their previous success was due to the defences up ahead being too weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the allied forces weren’t weak, they were fighting individually and their Battle Wills couldn’t be combined together. Whereas the zombie army had perfection in their coordination. Despite the amount of the two forces being close to each other, there was a huge gap between their strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for the zombie army losing their consciousness long ago, their allied forces would probably have suffered a terrible loss if the zombie army activated their Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, even so, it wasn’t that easy to break through the defences of this zombie army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And just as Mu Chen had expected, the allied forces started to slow down after their initial swift charge. The rampant rotten Battle Will that poured over from every direction was like a gathering of black clouds and the might of it even caused the earth to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the majestic Battle Will, the Divine Pavilion, which charged at the front, had also started to be suppressed and their boundless Battle Will was suffering defeats, they couldn’t confront with the Battle Will suppression from the zombie army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sky Clear Sect, Titan Gate, activate your Battle Wills!”</span></p>

Her gentle voice was mixed with an additional tone of slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her yell, the Commanders of the Sky Clear Sect and Titan Gate that were behind the Divine Pavilion had nodded their heads and had swiftly charged out. Powerful Battle Wills swept out as they resisted the terrifying Battle Will from upfront along with the Divine Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Majestic Battle Wills violently clashed as the shock waves that rippled caused the space to endlessly distort, a scene that even made Fifth Grade Sovereigns feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Palace Master Liu Yan, I’ll leave the right wing to your Sky Profound Palace!” Zhantai Liuli looked towards the direction of the Sky Profound Palace, which was dealing with the right wing of the allied forces. In that direction, there was a boundless Battle Will that swept over in an attempt to tear apart the allied forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan nodded his head. At this moment, while their allied forces had been surrounded by the zombie army, he would naturally not act recklessly. After all, if the allied forces were torn apart, even they would have to pay a huge price to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he had immediately nodded his head towards Xiao Tian, who stood beside him. The latter had waved his hand and numerous troops of the Sky Profound Palace had burst forth with Battle Will, causing the earth to tremble. A boundless ocean of Battle Will swept out. It was so powerful that it managed to resist the rotten Battle Will from the right wing of the allied forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this scene, Mu Chen’s brows were slightly raised. Although Xiao Tian was hateful, he was still capable and had managed to stabilised the right wing of the allied forces with the power of the Sky Profound Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Mu, I’ll have to leave the rear of the allied forces to your Great Havenlaw Domain.” Zhantai Liuli shifted her gaze and her gentle voice was transmitted to Mu Chen’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen cupped his hands together from afar and nodded his head. “We’re all in the same boat, so my Great Havenlaw Domain will naturally do our best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli slightly nodded her head and her slow and unhurried voice rang through the entire allied force, “Everyone, please hold your own positions. If you’re encountering any problems, please seek help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli’s gentle voice had shown her calmness, since she wasn’t panicking from being surrounded by the zombie army. Because of that calmness, the entire allied forces were completely in order and their defences were tight. Even Mu Chen couldn’t help sighing in his heart about her abilities. He had realised that despite looking like a feeble girl, she was extremely talented in the formation of troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least Mu Chen knew that if it was him, he wouldn’t be able to adjust the entire allied forces that were filled with all sorts of schemes in this manner in such a short time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This girl is truly capable.” Beside Mu Chen, Nine Nether had praised out as well. Hearing her words, the other Kings had nodded their heads in acknowledgement and admiration. She was a girl that was a genius in Battle Will and could command a war, she was truly a formidable lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like she might’ve even been able to lead the allied forces to break through the Four Spiritual Army and confront the Four Spiritual Battle Formation of the Four Spiritual Army…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen and the rest were sighing, huge commotions rang out from the allied forces once again and all sorts of Battle Wills were resisting the Battle Will of the zombie army that was coming from every direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two powerful armies had started their confrontations between Battle Wills. There weren’t any fancy tricks, but every confrontation would result in innumerable zombie warriors being reduced to ashes. But, at the same time, casualties had also started to appear in the allied forces. But the casualties were still at the acceptable range. That’s because they were clear that if it wasn’t for Zhantai Liuli commanding the army, they wouldn’t have been able to charge into the zombie army, even if all of them died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the impact of numerous Battle Wills, the zombie army was being torn apart as the allied forces continued to charge forth into the plains of darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The front of the allied forces naturally suffered the greatest pressure. If it was any other force in this position, they would probably be all dead or injured soon enough. But Zhantai Liuli was smart and with more than ten troops under her command, they took turns to lead. The moment one troop couldn’t resist it any longer, it would immediately be changed with another powerful troop. This way, the spearhead could be maintained and tear apart the defence of the Four Spiritual Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up ahead, Zhantai Liuli could still split her attention to the wings of the allied forces, and every part was being taken care of by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But those top forces had done the most work in the fight, whereas the Divine Pavilion, Great Havenlaw Domain and Sky Profound Palace had only maintained the overall situation. In terms of casualties, they suffered even less than those top forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Towards this situation, Zhantai Liuli had only lightly spoken a sentence, which shut the mouths of those forces that suffered more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our three troops have to maintain our strength to deal with the Four Spiritual Battle Formation. If we exhaust too much of our Battle Will, then what’s the point of this task?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Zhantai Liuli’s words, the other forces could only swallow their words. That’s because they knew that they could only obtain the harvest by breaking the so-called “Four Spiritual Battle Formation”.</span></p>
