Who could have thought that when the light that enveloped the Great Havenlaw Ruler dispersed, it would be a cute little girl…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Havenlaw Ruler, whose fame resounded in the Northern Region, was a little girl?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, both the Great Havenlaw Domain and Hundred Battles Domain’s camp were completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She is actually the Great Havenlaw Ruler?” Nine Nether and Tang Bing, as well as the experts that had seen Mandala in the Nine Nether Palace, had disbelieved splendour in their eyes. Clearly, this scene had caused them quite a bit of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also overwhelmed with shock, which he only recovered from after a long while. Vaguely, he figured things out. It was no wonder why she had been deep asleep in the Greatlaw Goldpond and could come and go as she wished in the Great Havenlaw Domain without worrying about being detected by the Great Havenlaw Ruler. That also explained her fearsome strength…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So she was the mysterious Great Havenlaw Ruler!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s no wonder why she would protect us.” Nine Nether cast a glance at Mu Chen and understood why the Great Havenlaw Ruler, who was callous, would choose to protect them. The reason was clearly that of her relationship with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen bitterly smiled out as well, he didn’t have a deep relationship with Mandala, since the two of them were only helping each other out. Therefore, he was also filled with gratitude that she would bear the pressure and protect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala paid no attention to the commotion that was caused from her revealing herself as she swept her golden eyes with indifference, causing the commotion in the Great Havenlaw Domain’s camp to turn silent in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one dared to look at her golden pupils, because the indifference and prestige held in them made others feel fearful. Under that indifferent glance from Mandala, they had completely cleared up as well. Although she had a cute little girl appearance, she was still the Great Havenlaw Ruler, no matter how many changes were there to her appearance. Just a word from her alone could determine the life and death of them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor also peeked a glance at Mandala in astonishment, since this was the first time that they had seen her true appearance. Only the Sleeping Emperor kept a calm expression, since he seemed to have known this fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never imagined that the famous Great Havenlaw Ruler’s appearance would be a little girl, what a weird fetish you have.” Liu Tiandao stared at Mandala and couldn’t help sneering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reaching their strength, there were numerous ways to change their appearance. Thus, Liu Tiandao thought that Mandala had changed her appearance. After all, as long as anyone’s mind was working well, they could figure out that it was impossible for Mandala to possess the strength of an Earth Sovereign if her appearance was her true age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing his ridicules, Mandala maintained a calm expression as she said with indifference, “Liu Tiandao, you will not be able to take them from my hands, even if you go all-out. So it’s best for you to leave now to prevent wasting unnecessary strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning to her true appearance, her sharp hoarse voice had turned bright and tender. But in the ears of all the experts, it gave additional flavours of mystery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, under that petite body and tender voice, was a powerful and cold expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s gaze was a little cold, since he knew that what Mandala had said wasn’t wrong. Previously, when they fought, he sensed that Mandala’s current strength was even slightly stronger than his own, and if they were to fight, he would not be able to gain any upper hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you’re fixed on ruining the relationship with my Sky Profound Palace.” Liu Tiandao said darkly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wasn’t it ruined long ago?” A mocking arc rose on Mandala’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, very good.” Liu Tiandao laughed from the anger as he nodded his head. His gaze was eerily looking at Mandala as he continued, “Remember your words today, Great Havenlaw Ruler. I hope that you can still be so tough during the Hunting War.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he said those words, the faces of the Sky Vulture Emperor and the rest changed. The Hunting War was too brutal, with peak forces falling every single time, and their Great Havenlaw Domain had quite a number of enemies. With the Sky Profound Palace in addition, it wasn’t good news for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Liu Tiandao’s threats, Mandala maintained an indifferent expression and that expression of hers made Liu Tiandao’s mood even worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-clothed man that stood beside Liu Tiandao, whom had launched attacks towards Mu Chen earlier but was obstructed by Nine Nether, calmly said, “Looks like you are the strongest amongst the younger generations of the Great Havenlaw Domain right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen frowned his brows as he looked at the white-clothed man. He could vaguely sense danger coming from the latter. That fellow must be very formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” asked Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Yan of the Sky Profound Palace.” The white-clothed man smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether narrowed her eyes as she softly said, “He’s the Young Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace, Liu Ming’s elder brother. It’s no wonder why he has such strength, rumour has it that he can even be considered as outstanding amongst the younger generation of the Northern Region. His strength is much greater than Liu Ming’s.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s heart slightly trembled upon hearing her words. He was indeed a thorny person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like I will not be able to cripple your Spiritual Energy today. But that doesn’t matter, I believe that you will partake in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven as the representative of the Great Havenlaw Domain. So we will meet there.” Liu Yan gave Mu Chen a light smile that contained a bone-chilling coldness within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen narrowed his eyes. Liu Yan had a pretty good eyesight. After today’s battle, his fame amongst the Domain Lords of the Great Havenlaw Domain would reach the peak. It was so much so that even Xu Qing and Zhou Yue would be incomparable to him. So he would definitely get the quota for the Dragon-Phoenix Haven that would take place shortly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging from the current situation, Liu Yan would also be participating in it, as well. So if they were to encounter at that time, there wouldn’t be anyone that could save him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… Liu Yan was treating Mu Chen too much like a weakling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he looked at Liu Yan, without any fear in his eyes. “We will see at that time. But I have to warn you to be careful not to turn into a stepping stone. If that happens, then I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan laughed as he gently tapped the jade fan in his hand against his palm. He did not speak, but only had a ridicule arc that rose on the corner of his lips, giving him an ignoring look of disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, Liu Yan did not place the youth who had just displayed a shocking feat in the battle earlier in his heart. It wasn’t because he was arrogant, it was because he was qualified to do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he was the future Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao was also satisfied with Liu Yan’s words. At the very least, they had gotten some face back. Although they still had to wait till the Dragon-Phoenix Haven began, it was no big deal. As long as that brat, Mu Chen, participated in it, then he would definitely die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And if that kid were to give up participating in it due to fear, then Liu Tiandao had his ways to embarrass the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Havenlaw Ruler, you can consider it your win this time. But I hope that you can smile till the end.”</span></p>

He was well-informed of the many forces in the Northern Region right now, so he knew how powerful the Netherworld Palace was. It was an old peak force that had gone through three to four Hunting Wars, which clearly spoke of their terrifying strength.</span></p>

Mu Chen never thought that the Nether Sky Sovereign would have enmity with Mandala. It looked like this Greatlaw Continent was truly filled with dangers in every corner.</span></p>

He no longer spoke as he waved his hand, turning into a streak of light that enveloped Liu Yan and Liu Ming, before distorting space and left.</span></p>

But in the end, she coldly snorted and directed her chilling golden pupils at the Sword Concealing Elder’s group in the Hundred Battles Domain camp.</span></p>

If it is not done, I will personally knock on the door to clear up your sects!” Mandala’s indifferent voice resounded in the sky, which made many experts of the Hundred Battles Domain’s hearts tremble.</span></p>
