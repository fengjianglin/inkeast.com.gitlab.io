 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The start of this gathering was actually filled with fire and filled with gunpowder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Asura King’s voice resounded, the black-armoured Heavenly Evil King that stood before the Netherworld Palace slowly raised his eyes and exchanged a gaze with the Asura King. The chill in his eyes was also extremely intense that it could freeze even the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Asura King, is that an attitude to use to make a request?” The Heavenly Evil King slowly said with his voice filled with mockery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If your Great Havenlaw Domain can lower your attitude and make a request, I might really let the Glacier King go, taking the big picture into consideration. But judging from your current attitude, you don’t look like you’re here to negotiate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold smile rose on the Asura King’s face as he looked at the Heavenly Evil King, “Heavenly Evil King, which eyes of yours see that I’m here to negotiate? Regardless of whether you hand the Glacier King over or not, my Great Havenlaw Domain will not let this matter with your Netherworld Palace rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Asura King’s words were firm and decisive and a dense killing intent could be felt. The Glacier King was captured and his subordinates were completely slaughtered. If they were to swallow this grudge, then it would definitely destroy the reputation of their Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ridiculing smile that hung on the face of the Heavenly Evil King had also been completely retracted. Clearly, the firm and decisive attitude of the Asura King had exceeded his expectations. They were initially planning on destroying the reputation of the Great Havenlaw Domain. But from the current looks of it, the Asura King was also truly shrewd without the slightest compromise, causing their plan to fail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if their plan had failed, it didn’t affect the general situation. Today’s matter was naturally a trap for the Great Havenlaw Domain, to begin with. The Heavenly Evil King’s face flickered with eeriness as he said with indifference, “Not letting this matter rest? Asura King, did you think that my Netherworld Palace is like those inferior forces?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Today, all the forces of my Netherworld Palace has gathered here. So what can your Great Havenlaw Domain do even if all your forces are out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Asure King coldy replied, “So what? My Great Havenlaw Domain can risk casualties to engage a deathmatch with your Netherworld Palace. At that time, both of our forces can die together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them were peak forces of the Northern Region. So if they fought for real, they would definitely go all-out. At that time, regardless of who emerged victory, they would have to pay a great price. At that time, the fruits of their victory would probably not belong to either of them, but to those that were still eyeing them in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Evil King squinted his eyes. The Asura King’s decisive attitude had had truly made them feel pressured. After all, not just anyone could be so decisive in engaging in a deathmatch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other forces were speechless as they watched this confrontation. Both forces emanated killing intent. They naturally had no qualifications to join a fight of this level, so they could only sit and watch as the battle breaks out. They would see if there was any chance for them to fish for benefits from that fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Asura King is still so ruthless, even after all these years, truly admirable. But I’m afraid that it’s not possible for your Great Havenlaw Domain to stake a situation of us suffering heavy casualties.” Just as a cold light flashed in the Heavenly Evil King’s eyes, a burst of laughter suddenly resounded from another direction. Countless gazes were directed over and they all saw that the Sky Dragon Lord, who stood before the Divine Pavilion’s party, was laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Sky Dragon Lord spoke out, many forces felt a tremble in their hearts as they vaguely felt the abnormal situation. They could practically tell that in this gathering, the Netherworld Palace and Divine Pavilion were actually aiming for the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the shock in their hearts could calm down, the golden-armoured man that stood before the Sky Profound Palace spoke out in a low voice as well. “Since the Great Havenlaw Domain has made so many enemies, then my Sky Profound Palace will join in. We’ll see if your Great Havenlaw Domain can retreat unharmed today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

They clearly did not expect that the Netherworld Palace, Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace would actually be going after the Great Havenlaw Domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing three peak forces, even if the Great Havenlaw Domain was a peak force, it would be hard for them to escape the fate of annihilation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that before the decisive battle of the Hunting War, the Great Havenlaw Domain would be annihilated here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other forces had their eyes flickering as the atmosphere froze. With the four peak forces standing in confrontation, the atmosphere that they gave off was suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Palace’s Netherworld Prince, Divine Pavilion’s Fang Yi and Sky Profound Palace’s Liu Yan and Xiao Tian were coldly looking towards Mu Chen of the Great Havenlaw Domain. It’s as if Mu Chen was a prey that was about to fall into their hands. After all, it was a hopeless situation for the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the encirclement of three peak forces, the outcome of the Great Havenlaw Domain was determined.</span></p>

The latter still maintained a calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When we capture you later, we’ll see if you still can act tough!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The four of them sneered in their hearts as they thought that Mu Chen was just putting up a strong front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire region was silent and the atmosphere was frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had also sensed the gazes of Fang Yi and the rest when he stood before the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party. However, he had completely disregarded them with his eyes hung low. A brief moment later, a voice resounded and his tense body had also loosened up because that voice came from the Demon Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe. Since you guys are bullying with numbers, my Demon Gate cannot idly stand by and watch. Shouldn’t your Netherworld Palace give us an explanation to crippling the Battle Will genius of our Demon Gate?” The one that spoke was naturally that bewitching Demon Fairy,. She chuckled as she looked at the direction of the Netherworld Palace, except that her soft voice was filled with coldness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden interruption of the Demon Gate had broken this stiffened atmosphere and the Heavenly Evil King of the Netherworld Palace was briefly stunned, before his face turned dark as he looked at Demon Fairy and coldly said, “What? Your Demon Gate is going to interfere in this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since everyone is seeking their own grudges, then let my Myriad Saint Peak come out as well.”</span></p>

Some time ago, your pavilion surrounded the Azure Elder of my Myriad Saint Peak and caused him to fall. We still have to settle this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Myriad Saint Peak revealed their intentions of interfering, the other forces in this region abruptly sucked in cold breaths with shock in their eyes. What was the current situation? The six peak forces were going to directly declare war?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were to fight, then it would definitely change the situation in the Northern Region!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other forces all looked with interest in their eyes. They never expected this confrontation to be so intense right from the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the other spectating forces, the leaders of the Netherworld Palace, Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace’s faces had gradually turned dark. The sudden interference from the Demon Gate and Myriad Saint Peak had destroyed their plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They never expected that the Great Havenlaw Domain would actually secretly pull forces over. If that was the case, then there was no meaning in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because, if the Great Havenlaw Domain, Myriad Saint Peak and Demon Gate joined together, the strength of those three forces wasn’t any weaker than their own. So if they were to forcefully initiate the battle, it was a price that none of them was willing to bear.</span></p>

Truly an endless flow of good shows today. But my Divine Serpent Palace will not partake in this. You guys can play however you guys want, I’ll just watch from the side.”</span></p>

It was evident from his attitude that he was not going to interfere in this battle.</span></p>

The Divine Serpent Palace was truly cunning, they were definitely planning to watch from the side and fish for benefits once the battle breaks out.</span></p>

In fact, everyone knew that when both sides were equal, then chances of a battle breaking out would be greatly decreased…</span></p>

Since those peak forces wouldn’t engage in a dogfight, then how were they going to have the opportunity to rise?</span></p>

That’s because it was practically Mu Chen’s achievement in communicating with the Myriad Saint Peak and Demon Gate.</span></p>

The Netherworld Palace attempted to make use of the grudges they had with the Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace to deal with them, but they had forgotten that they could use such a tactic as well.</span></p>

With all of them gathered together, the show was just starting.</span></p>
