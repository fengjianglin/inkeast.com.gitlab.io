 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Great Havenlaw Ruler’s hoarse voice resounded, the party of the Great Havenlaw Domain was silent, which followed after an uproar that could not be suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was looking at Mu Chen, dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Qing and Zhou Yue were stunned as they exchanged a glance. Their lips moved but no words came from them. After all, it was a selection that the Great Havenlaw Domain had chosen himself, so they did not dare to refute his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if they did not say it, there were traces of doubt in their eyes that was still revealed. They had seen the confrontation between Mu Chen and Wu Tian, knowing that this young man wasn’t as simple as he looked on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when Mu Chen fought with Wu Tian, he was relying on the Nine Nether Troop’s Battle Will. Right now, he had to rely on his own capabilities… which made everyone feel doubtful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the commotion broke out, when everyone was stunned, even Mu Chen couldn’t help widening his mouth. Shortly after, he gave Tang Bing, who was by his side, a weird glance. The latter, Tang Bing also had a similar expression as him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, she couldn’t figure out why Mu Chen was chosen by the Great Havenlaw Ruler…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although many people had doubts flashing in their eyes, the prestige of the Great Havenlaw Ruler was too great. It was so much so that no one dared to sound any objections. Except that the silence that followed after the uproar was unharmonious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether gave Mu Chen a weird glance and briefly hesitated, before cupped her hands, “Domain Ruler, Mu Chen’s experience is shallow. Isn’t it a little too dangerous to let him go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the three fights were extremely important, so the ones chosen for the fights would feel great pressure. It was fine if they won, but if they lost, the pressure that they would feel wouldn’t be light. Although Nine Nether also wanted Mu Chen to stand out in this fight, she did not want Mu Chen to be in such a dangerous situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, the Great Havenlaw Ruler waved his hand and smiled, “It’s fine, let him go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the insistence of the Great Havenlaw Ruler, Nine Nether no longer spoke, but her gaze was a little weird. She couldn’t understand why the Great Havenlaw Ruler would pay so much attention to Mu Chen. According to reason, with Mu Chen’s current strength, he wasn’t qualified to be watched by the Great Havenlaw Ruler…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone kept quiet at the sight of this and no longer spoke as well. The words of the Great Havenlaw Ruler had absolute authority in the Great Havenlaw Domain. Since he had already decided, no one would dare to go against his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the choice of the Commander fell onto Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain exchanged looks and sighed in their hearts. They hoped that they could win the first two battle so the outcome of Mu Chen’s battle wouldn’t be important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing those weird sighing gazes, Mu Chen could only helplessly fling his lips aside. He also had no idea what went wrong with the Great Havenlaw Ruler to the point that he insisted for him to fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hoho, looks like the Great Havenlaw Ruler has already chosen your men.” Sword Concealing Elder laughed. He swept a glance at the Sleeping Emperor, who had his eyes hung low, with a smear of fear flashing across his eyes. He also knew that among the Three Emperors of the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Sleeping Emperor was the most unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, his gaze swept past the Asura King, who was donned in battle armour, with an indifferent expression. But under that calm-looking gaze of his, there was a surge of terrifying killing intent that made others feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the Nine Kings, the Asura King’s strength was the strongest. Rumour had it that in the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Asura King had the highest chance of becoming an Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Concealing Elder then had his gaze fall onto Mu Chen. His was stunned when he looked at Mu Chen. A Second Grade Sovereign? Since when was the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain so weak?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smear of doubt flashed in the Sword Concealing Elders eyes, but he did not show it and smiled, “Since the chosen people have already been decided, let Great Havenlaw Ruler decide the order of the fights.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dense light surged around the Great Havenlaw Ruler. He cast a glance at the Sleeping Emperor and the latter slowly walked out with a smile, “Then, let us start from the strongest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he took a step forth, he appeared high up in the sky. He then looked at the Devil Compassion Sovereign. “I have long heard that the Devil Compassion Sovereign is a heaven-favoured genius that has broke through the shackles of the Lower Plane. It is indeed fortunate for me to witness it today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Compassion Sovereign smiled upon hearing his words. His figure lightly undulated, then mysteriously disappeared and reappeared before the Sleeping Emperor like ripples of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have long hear about the Great Dreams Divine Scripture that Brother Meng can cultivate when you are in your half-asleep state. I hope that I can witness such a fascinating technique today.” The Devil Compassion Sovereign’s pupils, which looked like the starry skies, looked at the Sleeping Emperor as he slowly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You flatter me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sleeping Emperor smiled as the sleepiness that hung in his eyes the whole time swiftly disappeared, replaced with a dazzling sharp lustre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the heavens, the layers of clouds instantly dispersed, and distorting savage-looking cracks appeared in the space. Shortly after, the Sleeping Emperor made a grasping gesture. The pitch-black spatial crack appeared in his hand, looking like a small black snake. However, only those with keen eyes could tell the terrifying energy contained within the black little snake formed from the spatial crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the power of space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Controlling space, Eighth Grade Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless experts in this region inhaled a mouthful of chilled air. Only an Eighth Grade Sovereign could control the power of space so casually, and as someone that could achieve it, it meant that the Sleeping Emperor was an Eighth Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the rear, the Sky Vulture King and Spiritual Pupils Emperor helplessly smiled at this sight. It looked like the Sleeping Emperor was a step ahead of them. Although they had come in contact with the foothold of Eighth Grade Sovereign, they had not fully stepped over and still had some ways to go in order to achieve that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As expected of Lord Sleeping Emperor…” Tang Bing couldn’t help sighing as well. According to her knowledge, the strength displayed by the Three Sovereigns should be somewhere in the Seventh Grade Sovereign. But clearly, that information was outdated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head as well as he looked at the figure standing on the sky. The energy emanated from his body could lay destruction and devastation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes of shock, the Sleeping Emperor gave a lightly smile towards the Devil Compassion Sovereign and flicked his finger. The pitch-black little snake that was in his hand mysteriously disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the pitch-black little snake formed from the energy of space disappeared, the space around the Devil Compassion Sovereign abruptly distorted. Shortly after, the space was torn apart and a sinister-looking crack appeared. It was like a slice of space as it flew towards the Devil Compassion Sovereign without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any earth-shattering Spiritual Energy momentum from that attack. But the danger held in it far surpassed the confrontation between Spiritual Energies. The power held in the spatial crack could kill a Fifth Grade Sovereign in an instant. The crucial point was that it wasn’t an attack that could be avoided. No matter how fast you were, it could not be comparable to the speed of others tearing space apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t a change of expression on the Devil Compassion Sovereign’s face as he held a single hand before him. He lightly smiled as the space around him distorted as well. Sinister-looking spatial cracks appeared and clashed with the incoming spatial crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fine noises came from the sky as the spatial cracks clashed together, erasing each other, but there wasn’t any stunning explosion that resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spatial control?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even the Devil Compassion Sovereign has step into Eighth Grade Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone exclaimed in surprise. Anyone could tell that the Devil Compassion Sovereign had deployed similar techniques to erase the incoming attacks of the spatial cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the Devil Compassion Sovereign also possessed the strength of an Eighth Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow is truly a formidable figure that has broke through the boundaries of the Lower Plane.” Tang Bing spoke with her brows knitted tight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like there will be a fierce battle to determine the outcome of this battle.” Mu Chen had a grave expression. It was no wonder why the Devil Compassion Sovereign was pushed out as the fighter of the level of Emperors. He had concealed so much strength. Even amongst the three heads of the Hundred Battles Domain, his cultivation as an Eighth Grade Sovereign ought to be the strongest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Things are interesting now. I hope I am not rusty after not fighting for a long time.” The Sleeping Emperor watched this scene and couldn’t help smiling. His gaze turned sharp. Such an opponent was worthy of him being serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am looking forward to it, Brother Meng.” Devil Compassion Sovereign smiled without any fluctuation in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sleeping Emperor smiled and shut his eyes again. As he shut his eyes, the space behind him started to distort. This region looked like it had turned into a black hole as it violently devoured the Spiritual Energy of this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the streaks of Spiritual Energy gathering together, a massive figure of a few thousand feet was gradually formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure sat on the sky, enveloped with a dazzling lustre, but it wasn’t an illusion.
