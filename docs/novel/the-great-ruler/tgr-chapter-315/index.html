 <p><strong>Chapter 315 - Shock</strong></p>
 <p>In the air, Mu Chen looked at the figures retreating in succession before quietly taking a breath of relief. Fortunately, the shock created from them killing the Spirit King was too great. If not, it might’ve been truly hard to force those fellows into retreating today.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen turned around and waved his palm. The two lustrous spirit crystals, approximately 1.5 metres long, floated to his front. With a flick of his finger, one of them swept towards Luo Li.</p>
 <p>“Half for each of us.”</p>
 <p>Luo Li smiled sweetly while nodding her small head. With a light hoist of her jade-like hand, she stored her half of the spirit crystal. This was very beneficial to her. With this spirit crystal half, she might be able to obtain quite a few benefits from the Spiritual Light Empowerment.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. We should also leave this place. The previous fight was overly intense. We’ve got to find a place to recuperate.” Mu Chen spoke out while storing the other half of the spirit crystal.</p>
 <p>Luo Li nodded her head. Without anymore hesitation, the two settled on a direction. With a move of their bodies, they shot towards the distance, and had already disappeared into the horizon within a single breath.</p>
 <p>As they left, the mountain range turned calm and peaceful once again. Only the earth was left in a disastrous state, which was the only evidence that an astonishing fight had erupted at that place.</p>
 <p>However, when Mu Chen and Luo Li had left, they did not know that the matter about them killing the Spirit King had already created some giant waves.</p>
 <p>—Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Northern Sea Plaza—</p>
 <p>Within these last few days, the exceptionally expansive field was seemingly filled to the brim at all times. Countless students had converged there, raising their heads to look at the sky above the field.</p>
 <p>There was a gigantic screen located in the center. Within the screen were the peaks of three gigantic mountains faintly discernable in the clouds. At the top of the peak, one could faintly discern three figures quietly sitting there. An invisible pressure radiated from there, making all the people within the field feel uneasy.</p>
 <p>They knew that this was the final point of the hunt. The people there were the final protectors.</p>
 <p>And that place, was the final pass of this hunt.</p>
 <p>Naturally, only on the final day for the arrival of the big fight would they be able to witness the appearance of that heaven-shockingly great battle.</p>
 <p>Before that day, they would not be able to acquire much information of what happened within the hunt.</p>
 <p>However, it would seem like there was an exception every time.</p>
 <p>The light array that usually did not have any activity suddenly rippled and undulated. This strange movement attracted the surprise of countless students, as gaze after gaze was sent shooting over to see.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the final stage arrived so quickly?”</p>
 <p>Numerous doubtful whispers rang out as everyone had faces brimming with shock and amazement. Obviously, they did not know exactly what this appearance meant.</p>
 <p>In the front of the field, and the front of those seats located there, was the seat of Dean Tai Cang. On his left and right were a few Northern Spiritual Heavens Academy Elders. At this time, all of them had raised their heads to look at the rippling and undulating light screen.</p>
 <p>There would be Elders specially supervising the hunt from inside. In most circumstances, if not for the final pass, the light screen would only show absolutely important information that happened within.</p>
 <p>As doubtful gazes converged on the rippling light screen, it finally formed a clear image of a range of mountains. However, at this time, the mountain range was shaking. A radiant giant, approximately 300 metres high, towered over as tyrannical Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiated out, appearing and feeling extremely shocking.</p>
 <p>“That’s a Spirit King?!”</p>
 <p>As the giant appeared, voices of shock instantly rang out from within the field, while the faces of quite a few people had intense changes. Although the majority of the people here hadn’t participated in the hunt before, they had some consideration to gain some knowledge over the past few days. Naturally, they also knew what a so-called ‘Spirit King’ meant.</p>
 <p>“They’ve actually lured a Spirit King out?”</p>
 <p>It was not only them that were shocked. Even a few Elders stilling in the front were astonished. However, their foreheads started to wrinkle as they muttered, “Why does this Spirit King look weaker?”</p>
 <p>“This is a Spirit King that was recently born.” Dean Tai Cang’s eyes, which were akin to the depths of the universe, congealed on the giant within the light screen and replied with a smile.</p>
 <p>Only at this moment did the Elders have a flash of insight. Full of interest, they turned and looked over. Even if this was a recently-born Spirit King, it might not be something that those students could handle. They started to wonder which unfortunate little brats had met with it.</p>
 <p>As the light screen condensed, two figures became increasingly clear on the mountain peak in front of the Spirit King. When everyone was able to clearly see their appearances, shocked voices instantly erupted out.</p>
 <p>“That’s the Freshman called Mu Chen!”</p>
 <p>“The beautiful girl beside him should be called Luo Li, right? Fifteenth on the Heavenly Rankings. The two of them actually dared to challenge a Spirit King?”</p>
 <p>The two figures were recognized very quickly, and at once, the entire field was in an uproar. Everyone had a face of shock, as this had obviously exceeded their expectations by far.</p>
 <p>At the corner of the field, Ye Qingling, Zhou Ling and the rest of the Goddess Luo Association opened their mouths wide as they stared at the two in the light array with strange faces. Although they knew that Mu Chen would not be content in the hunt, they never thought that he would actually bring Luo Li to deal with a Spirit King.</p>
 <p>That was a tyrannical existence that was comparable to a Heavenly Completion Stage!</p>
 <p>Under countless shocked gazes, the light screen flashed. The big battle had already erupted. As the picture flashed, the earth moved and the mountains shook, as both parties had already launched their attacks.</p>
 <p>At the pictures of the combat continuously flashed. The students in the field, whose faces were filled with astonishment, started to slowly change grave, bit by bit, with even some terrified shadows erupting out in the end.</p>
 <p>They saw the strong and powerful Spirit King unexpectedly being forced into retreating.</p>
 <p>The final picture displayed on the screen rested on the slash that Luo Li sent out. As the azure ray of light shot out, the earth moved and the mountains shook. In that instant, the gigantic Spirit King was sliced into two, rumbling as its halves fell.</p>
 <p>While the light screen was vibrating, the entire field had turned deathly silent.</p>
 <p>That Spirit King, was unexpectedly, truly killed by Mu Chen’s and Luo Li’s combined attacks!</p>
 <p>At the seats in the front, the various Elders all had astonishment and shock on their faces. Dean Tai Cang’s eyes congealed on the light screen and looked towards the thin figure within. A trace of astonishment flashed within his eyes before he said in a soft voice, “This girl is, unexpectedly, a member of the Luo God Clan? That sword in her hand, could it be the Luo Shen Sword? Isn’t that the most valuable treasure of the Luo God Clan?”</p>
 <p>“Dean, her grandfather should be the Luo Tianshen.” said a white-haired old man beside Dean Tai Cang. From his appearance, impressively, it was the old man that Mu Chen and Luo Li had met when they went to the Spiritual Values Hall for the first time.</p>
 <p>“The granddaughter of Luo Tianshen?” the astonishment within Dean Tai Cang’s eyes increased. Unable to resist, he laughed out and said, “That old fellow was actually willing to allow his precious granddaughter train in our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy?”</p>
 <p>“However, this little miss’ talent is indeed extremely good. Being able to control the Luo Shen Sword at such an age shows that she’s not simple.”</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang’s vision suddenly shifted to look towards Mu Chen’s figure before saying out, “That little fellow’s called Mu Chen, right? Haha, the incidents within the Spiritual Road should’ve been caused by him, right?”</p>
 <p>The old man beside him smiled, while nodding his head as he replied, “The aftermath caused by that incident wasn’t small, okay? The Saint Spiritual Academy was determined to killing him then as a penalty; however, it was you, Dean, that didn’t accept that. This is the only reason why he was only expelled.”</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang gave a faint smile before saying , “This little fellow’s also a genius that is hard to come by. With additional guidance, he might not be inferior to Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong. The incident then was clearly due to Saint Spiritual Academy breaking some rules, and secretly giving that youth called Ji Xuan some hidden assistance. Did they really think that they could hide it from everyone? The only ones they could blame was themselves for the result they got in the end.”</p>
 <p>The white-haired old man nodded his head and said, “They’d taken a fancy for Ji Xuan’s talent, and wanted to rely on him to press our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy in the Five Academies Great Competition. In that way, they might be able to obtain the title of the Top Academy.”</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang’s eyes faintly narrowed as he continued to stare at the youthful figure in the light screen. Smiling, he muttered, “Although that Ji Xuan is a heaven-sent genius, this Mu Chen is also not simple…”</p>
 <p>While the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was flaring up in shock and astonishment by the pictures within the light screen, it was, similarly, not calm and peaceful within the hunting grounds. This was because the same piece of news had also circulated across the entire Spiritual Light World.</p>
 <p>“In the Northwest area, at an Extremely Dangerous Grade gathering point, a Spirit King was killed. The killers were Mu Chen and Luo Li.”</p>
 <p>Enveloped by vigorous Spiritual Energy, this news instantly resounded across the hunting grounds, causing the faces of innumerable people to change.</p>
 <p>A Spirit King… was killed?</p>
 <p>The entire hunting grounds shook due to this news. Inconceivable and incredulous expressions erupted on the faces of everyone as they thought, After these last few years, a Spirit King was finally killed by students?</p>
 <p>Weren’t these Mu Chen and Luo Li only Freshmen? How were they able to accomplish this feat?</p>
 <p>Innumerable people looked at each other. If not for the vigorous voices still ringing across the whole world, they would’ve assumed that it was some illusionary tale they’d heard.</p>
 <p>While secretly sighing, they thought, <em>looks like the darkest of all dark horses have already appeared within this hunt.</em></p>
 <p>Within the depths of the hunting grounds, on a desolated plain, a figure was strolling slowly with a long spear on his shoulder. Before him were Spirit Pawns hiding the skies and covering the earth. Smiling, he allowed the Spirit Pawn flood to engulf him.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Bright and resplendent golden light rushed towards the sky and swept out akin to an incomparably overbearing giant tide. The Spirit Pawns that hid the sky and covered the earth, as well as a large quantity of Spirit Generals, were immediately turned into dust at this instant, leaving behind fluttering Spiritual Lights that blotted the skies.</p>
 <p>As the figure appeared once again, with a wave of his sleeve, he retrieved the Spiritual Lights that blotted the sky. Raising his head, his hair draped over his shoulder as a disdainful aura prevaded out, looking extremely abnormal.</p>
 <p>That was precisely Shen Cangsheng.</p>
 <p>Staring at the northwest direction, he gave a smile as he thought, <em>Mu Chen, he is indeed an extremely interesting fellow; however, will he be able to climb up to the Spiritual Light platform at the final pass?</em></p>
 <p>Similarly, at the same time, in the depths of a mountain peak, Li Xuantong stood tall, with his hands behind his back. He had also looked towards the northwest direction; however, there wasn’t much fluctuations on that handsome face. Gazing at the direction for quite a while, he finally turned around, without saying even a single word.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>He Yao’s ferocious stomp caused a giant boulder, akin to a small mountain, to turn into dust. His eyes turned dark, while the crowd behind him trembled and shut their mouths, not daring to speaking any words.</p>
 <p>“He actually managed to kill a Spirit King. He truly has some ability…”</p>
 <p>Hu Yao coldly smiled, before turning around and walking towards the depths, before his chilling voice slowly rang out.</p>
 <p>“You’ve indeed saved me some trouble. Since that’s the case, I’ll kindly accept the Spiritual Light at the Spirit King level that’s in you hands, then.”</p>
