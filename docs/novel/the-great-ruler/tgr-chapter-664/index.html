 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the gentle tone from the lady-in-white before him, the guard in Mu Chen’s heart he had for strangers weakened. Although the lady’s expression was cold, perhaps it was because of Lin Jing that her gentle face could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen scratched his head and did not refuse, “Aunt Ling.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Lin Jing was the princess of the Martial Realm, this lady-in-white before him should undoubtedly be the mistress of the Martial Realm. That identity of hers was indeed frightening. If he could depend on it, she would definitely be a huge backing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen did not overthink about that matter. The reason why he got close to Lin Jing wasn’t because of her identity. He just had a favourable opinion only on her spiritual nature and wittiness alone, although she was a little too carefree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for having a backing or not, Mu Chen didn’t care about that as he knew that he could only depend on himself if he wanted to become a mighty figure. In this world, just the strength that belonged to you was the most reliable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady-in-white lightly smiled as she nodded her head, her laughter was bright and pleasant to listen to. Even after having a daughter, it was still so charming. Seeing her, Mu Chen couldn’t help recalling his own mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them were so outstanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me handle the matter here, first.” The lady-in-white abruptly turned her head as she smiled, looking into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and the rest were stunned for a brief moment, before their expressions turned ugly. There’s someone here? Then their mission this time was a little failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far away, hidden on the mountain, when Heart Fairy Fox and the middle-aged man saw the lady-in-white looking in their direction, their faces instantly changed and they immediately retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they had only just moved, before realisinh that the earth beneath them was bulging up. Stone spikes that were as sharp as swords swiftly extended from the ground, they were flickering with multiple colours. Clearly, they were the same as the mountain from before, formed with the purest Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stone spikes firmly stuck close to the two of them, making them not daring to move in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, we have no ill intentions!” Heart Fairy Fox’s ample chest gently heaved as she tried her best to calm her voice down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space faintly fluctuated before them as the lady-in-white strode out. She lightly knitted her brows as she watched the two of them, she seemed to be hesitating if she should suppress them as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, we are of the Celestial Fox Sect. Please let us go to the face of the Celestial Fox Queen.” The middle-aged man swiftly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Celestial Fox Sect?” Hearing that name, the lady-in-white’s gaze turned funny as she smiled, “So, you’re under the Hu Meizi of the Celestial Fox Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior knows our Sect Master?” Heart Fairy Fox enquired in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have seen her once before, except that she had her eyes only for my husband. However, the charm behind her Great Celestial Fox Art wasn’t sufficient,” smiled the lady-in-white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the Heart Fairy Fox and the middle-aged man grew red. They wanted to refute her claims in their hearts, but they didn’t dare to do that. The lady-in-white before them had an appearance that wasn't inferior to their Sect Master in many aspects. Although Heart Fairy Fox was also alluring, she was a little dull when standing before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I ask who this Senior might be?” Heart Fairy Fox clenched her teeth and couldn’t hold herself back from asking. The Sect Master was her most respected person. No one knew how many experts would do anything for her just for her smile. She refused to believe that the husband of this lady before her could let her Sect Master lose her composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Martial Realm, Ling Qingzhu,” said the lady-in-white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the few words, Heart Fairy Fox’s face drastically changed. She looked at the lady-in-white before her in disbelief as she muttered, “Mistress of the Martial Realm, Ling Qingzhu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She finally understood, since this person that stood before her was the mistress of the Martial Realm, her husband would naturally be the founder of the Martial Realm, the overpowering existence in the Great Thousand World, Martial Ancestor Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the eyesight of her Sect Master was high, it was understandable for her to be moved by such a powerful figure in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heart Fairy Fox was speechless as she muttered a sound and did not dare to speak again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu did not bother with such a child. She waved her hand, causing those stone spikes to slowly retract into the ground. The noiseless changes made the hearts of others feel cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pretend that the both of you have seen nothing today,” said Ling Qingzhu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she did not place the Sky Profound Palace in her eyes, Mu Chen couldn’t afford to do that. If the news spread, it would definitely cause trouble for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior can be rest assured, we’re both well-aware.” Heart Fairy Fox nodded her head. She was also incredibly witty as she understood what was to say and what wasn’t. After all, the Martial Realm was a colossal figure that they couldn’t afford to offend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu nodded her head and spoke nothing else, quietly disappearing from her initial spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she disappeared, Heart Fairy Fox and the middle-aged man felt relieved, with sweat covering their foreheads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How terrifying.” The middle-aged man spoke with fear as he continued, “The mistress of the Martial Realm’s strength has probably reached a terrifying height. Perhaps even our Sect Master might not be her opponent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That can’t be! Sect Master is also of the Earth Sovereign Realm, she might be a little inferior, but…” Heart Fairy Fox exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With her strength, those weren’t what you sensed. I have cultivated a Sensory Divine Art, thus being extremely sensitive to sensing. Under my sensing earlier, she was like a bottomless ocean. Although Earth Sovereign Realm experts are fearsome, it probably wasn’t till her level…” The middle-aged man gulped down a mouthful of saliva as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be…” Heart Fairy Fox’s eyes shrank as she muttered, “Could it be that this mistress of the Martial Realm… has also stepped into the realm of Heavenly Sovereign? The Martial Realm’s strength was so terrifying?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, as long as there’s a Heavenly Sovereign existence in a force, it was sufficient for it to become a significant force in the Great Thousand World. But judging from this, the Martial Realm had more than one?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the Martial Realm wasn’t powerful, how can they back up such a clan like the Ice Spiritual Clan that has such a long history? Furthermore, it is said that two mistresses in the Martial Realm possessed fearsome strength. This is just one of them…” the middle-aged man sighed as he felt how fearsome the Martial Realm was in his heart. The lady-in-white earlier still wasn’t a genuine Heavenly Sovereign, but she definitely had half a step into that realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is that kid related to the Martial Realm? Even the mistress of the Martial Realm came out…” Heart Fairy Fox was in doubt. It wasn’t possible for such an existence to usually show themselves, so why would she appear here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The young girl does look a little alike to her…” The middle-aged man pondered for a brief moment, before the two people looked at each other and understood what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seems like Liu Ming is truly unfortunate. Then again, it was considered good news for us that the Sky Profound Palace suffered such a huge blow.” Heart Fairy Fox smiled as she no longer dared to dally any longer. With a move of her figure, she was already swiftly flying towards the distance. Seeing her action, the middle-aged man followed as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen saw the lady-in-white appearing in the original spot once again. He felt ashamed when he realised that they were being spied on. He who had been cautious the whole time had made too many mistakes this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jing held onto Ling Qingzhu’s arm as she chuckled. Her pitch-black pupils were continually rolling around, but before she even did something, Ling Qingzhu already flicked her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t think of any more ideas. Your father has already said to bring you back, a must. Otherwise, I won’t be the one appearing the next time, it will be your father.” Ling Qingzhu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Lin Jing immediately had a bitter expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, why don’t you allow me to stay outside for a little longer.” Lin Jing begged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu shook her head, showing that there was no room for discussion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jing sunk her head down, but she raised it up shortly after as she looked at Mu Chen with expectation, “Mu Chen, why don’t you go to the Martial Realm with me, it’s fun there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With me looking after you, no one will bully you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen was a little awkward. After all, the Martial Realm was a high power in the Great Thousand World. Who knows how many experts tried getting in but were rejected. But he wasn’t too interested in this matter, finding a powerful backing wasn’t his motive in coming to the Great Thousand World…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps with the protection of the Martial Realm, no one would dare to provoke him. But that wasn’t what he wanted, if that was indeed the case, he might not even have the courage to meet Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he could only shake his head at Lin Jing’s request. “Although the Martial Realm is good, it’s not suitable for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” Lin Jing pouted as she spoke out in a dissatisfied manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Qingzhu took another glance at the youth, she saw the struggle in the youth’s eye, she couldn’t help smiling when she saw that struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because a long time ago, when she was of his age, she had seen a youth with such struggles in his eyes as well. After that, the youth had already become her husband.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there’s anything you need me to help, you can come to the Martial Realm.” Ling Qingzhu said softly. Not only was she not unsatisfied when she saw the youth rejecting the Martial Realm’s invitation, she felt satisfied and admiration instead. Thus, she who has always been cold had taken the initiative to give out the request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Aunt Jing. If there’s that day, I will definitely come.” Mu Chen nodded as he said earnestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Jing, why don’t you go back to Martial Realm and behave yourself. We’ll wait till you get stronger and I’ll play together with you. Right now, we’ll bid our farewell.” Mu Chen gave Lin Jing a smile. He did not continue on speaking as he cupped his fist at Ling Qingzhu and flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether had also lightly nodded her head at Ling Qingzhu as she followed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing how unloyal was Mu Chen to abandon her, Lin Qing stomped her feet in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This youth does seem interesting.” Ling Qingzhu looked at Mu Chen’s leaving figure as she smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a fool.” Lin Jing cast her lips aside. She had given out an invitation to the Martial Realm, didn’t he know that a single guidance was a hundred times better than blindly probing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s not a fool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu rubbed Lin Jing’s head as there were smile and admiration in her cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s an ambitious youth… an ambitious heart that was similar to your father when he was young. Except it’s unsure of his future…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You actually compared him with father?” Lin Jing widened her eyes. In her heart, her father was the most outstanding person in the world. Back then, he wreaked havoc at the Ice Spiritual Clan to rescue Aunt Bing. Every time when she recalls this matter, she would feel that her father was just too cool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there was an indescribable gap between Mu Chen and her father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu smiled as she raised her eyes and spoke softly, “It’s still unsure to determine the future…”</span></p>
