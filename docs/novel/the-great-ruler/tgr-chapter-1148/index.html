 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mu Chen waved his fist, the violent Spiritual Energy fluctuation at this area immediately disappeared and the massive Emperor Celestial Body shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Sovereign Celestial Body dispersed, the spectators were dumbfounded with disbelief in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He… he actually killed Xia Yu?!” Everyone gulped a mouthful of saliva as they looked at Mu Chen with fear filling their eyes. The decisiveness of the latter made them feel a chill surging in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was Xia Yu, the Crown Prince of the Xia Empire and also Xia Emperor’s Successor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Xia Yu’s importance, if the Xia Emperor knew that Xia Yu had fallen here, he would definitely not let the matter rest! Was the rage of Xia Emperor something a tiny Mu Chen could bear? That was naturally impossible…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen calmly looked at the headless corpse in the midst of everyone’s shock. That fist not only destroyed Xia Yu’s head, the killing aura behind his fist even destroyed Xia Yu’s Sovereign Sea…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Xia Yu had completely fallen today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen knew that he would completely offend the Xia Empire regarding this matter but he still had no intention of going easy. That’s because Mu Chen was clear that Xia Yu was a sinister figure. Even if Mu Chen managed to force him to retreat, Xia Yu would definitely bite back at him if there’s an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Xia Yu’s talent was good and according to Mu Chen’s estimations, if Xia Yu was given more time and with the resources of the Xia Empire, there’s a huge chance that he could make it to the Earth Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since that’s the case, then there was even more of the need to kill him. After all, Mu Chen did not wished to be watched by a future Earth Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After sorting out the reasons, had Mu Chen no longer hesitated to kill, and annihilated this successor of the Xia Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But this will completely offend the Xia Empire.” Mu Chen’s gaze flickered. The Xia Emperor was a tyrant in the Greatlaw Continent and if the Xia Emperor decided to make his move, it would definitely be a disaster for Mu Chen. But fortunately, he had Mandala supporting him, so there’s nothing to fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like there’s an absolute need to help Mandala find her main body.” Mu Chen grinned. The Xia Emperor was also a Greater Earth Sovereign with a Middle Rank Saint Artifact. So his fighting strength could be considered as extraordinary amongst the Greater Earth Sovereigns. Even Mandala wouldn’t be confident about winning. Not to mention that Mandala still had an enemy that she must deal with, the ruler of the Demonic Saint Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, as a guarantee, he had to help Mandala find her main body. Once Mandala fused with her main body, her strength would be restored to the Perfected Earth Sovereign Realm. At that time, not to mention a Xia Emperor, Mandala’s strength could also be ranked amongst the top in the entire Greatlaw Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he and Mandala were friends, he couldn’t always have her clean up his mess. So he had to do something for her as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he definitely had to complete the mission of finding Mandala’s main body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about it, Mu Chen no longer hesitated and raised his head up to see a black jade seal floating in the air. It was the Mountain River’s Ruler Seal that was used by Xia Yu earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen stretched his hand out and took it. He was extremely interested in this treasure that could isolate the Sovereign Celestial Body. This time, if it wasn’t for the fact that he had perfectly executed the Self-Sacrificial Demonic Punch, he might have had to bring out the Wind God’s Fan in order to deal with the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen held onto the black jade seal and briefly sensed it before his brows furrowed. That’s because he realised that the Spiritual Energy within it had been completely exhausted from the last battle and if he wanted to use it again, he would have to spend a great amount of time to pour Spiritual Energy into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tossing the seal in his hand, Mu Chen stored it. Although the Spiritual Energy in it had been completely exhausted, it was still an extraordinary treasure and there might be a use for it if he kept it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen waved his hand and a Golden Dragon Plaque appeared. It had previously belonged to Xia Yu. Mu Chen gently patted the plaque and saw lumps of light rising and floated before him, they were the Heavenly Lake Crystals, a total of 8 of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, those were Xia Yu’s harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That fellow’s efficiency was pretty good…” Mu Chen looked at the 8 crystals and couldn’t help being a little astonished. He had been bitterly setting traps here and only managed to obtain 13, which wasn’t much different from Xia Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all these had benefitted Mu Chen in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Mu Chen stored those 8 crystals without any hesitation under everyone’s greedy gazes. This way, he would have 21 crystals and as long as he could obtain 9 more, he would have reached the minimum requirement for the baptism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he stored the harvest, Mu Chen swept a glance into the distance. As the battle ripples dissipated, he could also vaguely sense some silhouettes approaching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those people were looking at Mu Chen with greed in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Mu Chen had emerged victorious from the previous battle, he must have also greatly exhausted himself. The Great Solar Undying Body beneath his feet had already been recalled to save Spiritual Energy, but from the Spiritual Energy coming from Mu Chen, he was obviously much weaker than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those experts had sensed Mu Chen’s exhaustion so they couldn’t help approaching with the intent to see if they had a beneficial opportunity. After all, the Mountain River Ruler’s Seal and Heavenly Lake Crystals that Mu Chen had obtained were tempting for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing those fellows, Mu Chen coldly cast a glance before retreating back into the fortress of Spiritual Arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the Spiritual Arrays, Mu Chen flicked his fingers and the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array, which was the outer layer, started to move. Instantly, a boundless Spiritual Energy exploded forth with a powerful pressure spreading out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those silhouettes that tried to approach felt how terrifying the Spiritual Array was and their faces uncontrollably changed. They had felt an extreme danger coming from that Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That Mu Chen is truly not simple… To actually manage to set up such a formidable Spiritual Array. No wonder even Xia Yu did not dare to enter the range of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Mu Chen had used his Spiritual Arrays in the previous battle, Xia Yu would probably lose even faster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it, that fellow is not a pushover. Let’s not provoke him…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those experts sighed before they decisively retreated. Facing Mu Chen, they had no advantage to take.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mu Chen saw this, he did not make any movements. Instead, he sat down in the Spiritual Array and swiftly recovered himself to his pinnacle state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing his actions, everyone could only leave. After all, they had to capture the Heavenly Lake Crystals as well, no one wanted to wait here. Furthermore, if Mu Chen managed to recover and come after them, then it would be a misfortune for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, in just a few minutes, this region had quieted down with the lake water splashing, swiftly erasing the traces of battle there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, in another location of the Heavenly Lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment when Xia Yu was killed, Zhu Yan had narrowed his eyes. The outcome had exceeded his expectations. However, he did not speak a word as he turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao looked at his silhouette and chuckled, “Wait till I’m done with this, I will come and play with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her laughter was bewitching, but when Zhu Yan heard her words, he squinted his eyes. Evidently, he knew that obstructing Xiao Xiao had enraged her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll be waiting.” In the end, he nodded his head and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That Mu Chen is truly something…” Su Qingyin played with a crimson centipede before raising her head and smiled at Nine Nether. However, her smile was a little more grave. She had fought with Xia Yu in the past and knew how powerful Xia Yu was. Even she wasn’t confident in killing him, but Mu Chen accomplished it, which had evidently made her feel a little startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine Nether coldly looked at Su Qingyin, but she couldn’t be bothered to converse with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, rest assured. I will not take part in matters like this anymore. You guys have the advantage of numbers and even I am fearful of that.” Seeing Nine Nether’s cold expression, Su Qingyin lightly smiled before she waved her hand and controlled the azure lustre to leave.</span></p>
