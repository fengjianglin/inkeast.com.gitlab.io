 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Therefore, we would need to get a vote of all five Deans of the Five Great Academies before using the Mirror of Judgement. Only with at least three votes, can we use the Mirror of Judgement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen scratched his head as he bitterly smiled. He naturally knew that it was not an easy task to use the Mirror of Judgement, but this was his only choice to get any news of the Immortal Catalog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Among the Five Great Academies, the Saint Spiritual Academy will probably not agree to it, but we can fight for the three other academies.” Northern Sea Dragon, who had not spoken from the beginning, opened his mouth, “I’ll make a trip to the three other academies, I believe they will give this old man some face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Tai Cang and the rest were startled by his words. The Northern Sea Dragon rarely interfered in the matters of the academy, they couldn’t imagine that he would actually do this for Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also stunned as he gratefully looked at Northern Sea Dragon, “Thank you, Senior Northern Sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that it was a tough matter for an Earth Sovereign to come out, and with the pride of Northern Sea Dragon, it was probably rare for him to take the initiative to pull relations. However, Mu Chen did not reject as he knew that with the Northern Sea Dragon’s personality, if he were to refuse his favour, this isolated old man would immediately not care about him. Thus, he could only remember this favour in his heart at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it wasn’t for your achievements in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, I’m afraid that it would be hard for the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to continue holding onto the title of the Five Great Academies. Compared to that, this is nothing for an old man like me to show my face.” Northern Sea Dragon looked at Mu Chen with a rare smile revealed on his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am a member of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, be it now or in the future.” Mu Chen lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, with those words of yours, it’s worth me pulling my face down.” Northern Sea Dragon revealed a gratified smile on his face as he waved his hand at Dean Tai Cang and the rest, “I will make a trip to the three academies now, the rest of you will remain in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Mu Chen, wait for my news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he finished speaking, Northern Sea Dragon strode forth, space distorted before him and shortly after, a spatial crack was ripped open as he went in and instantly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the swift and decisive Northern Sea Dragon, Mu Chen felt grateful in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, you’ll remain in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy and wait for the news.” Dean Tai Cang patted Mu Chen’s shoulder and pondered for a brief moment before he continued speaking, “After this matter, you intend on leaving the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s for the best, if you continue to remain in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, there will be a limit to your cultivation. The Great Thousand World is more suitable for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Tai Cang smiled, “But remember the words I said before, as long as you do not commit any actions that will bring down the academy, you are always a student of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. No matter what troubles you have incurred in the outside world, as long as you return to the academy, our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy will not let anyone bully you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen glanced at the gratified smile on Dean Tai Cang’s face and felt touched in his heart. He did not say any other words, only heavily nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a place that he would always remember.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Tai Cang conversed with Mu Chen for another short while, before letting him leave. Mu Chen brought along Nine Nether as he headed towards Ling Xi’s serene courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Entering the courtyard, a girl was seated before the bamboo house as she drank some tea. When the latter saw Mu Chen’s arrival, she let out a faint smile, but when she saw Nine Nether, who was behind him, her brows had undetectable risen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Congratulations, you have finally become a Sovereign expert.” Ling Xi smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as well as he sat before Ling Xi. Facing the beautiful girl before him, Mu Chen hesitated for a brief moment before saying, “Big Sister Ling Xi, I will leave the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy very soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hand which Ling Xi used to pour tea trembled as she gave Mu Chen a glance, before nodding her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Ling Xi, are you coming along with me?” Mu Chen said in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Xi remained silent for a long time before shaking her head, “After your departure, I will also leave the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. But I will not be following you, I have other matters to attend to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Other matters?” Mu Chen was stunned. He looked at Ling Xi, who was biting her rosy lip, &nbsp;as he wrinkled his brows, “You’re going to find my mother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Xi nodded her head as her face became slightly cold. “My memories have been sealed for a long time. But I can still vaguely sense come broken memories, so I intend to go search for her by myself. No matter what, I have to know where Aunt Jing was taken to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, it’s too dangerous for you to go alone! If you want to go, I’ll have to go with you!” Mu Chen’s face slightly changed as he spoke in a stern voice. Although he had not come in contact with that mysterious clan, he could sense how terrifying they were. His mother’s strength was comparable to a Heavenly Sovereign, and even so, she was confined, and Ling Xi’s strength was only equivalent to a Fourth Grade Sovereign. If she was discovered by those people, her safety would be at stake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t speak nonsense.” Ling Xi gently smiled, “Aunt Jing was willing to suffer so much yearning pain to protect you, how can I let you come with me to risk yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, you don’t have to worry about me, I will act accordingly and will not be rash. I will only be investigating in the dark, and when I have any news, I will come look for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After all, you will be going to find Aunt Jing in the future as well. You can’t be in the dark about everything, right? Therefore, I will go ahead first and see if I can find any information for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at Ling Xi. There was a rare gentleness on her face with a faint smile hanging at the corner of her lips. Her voice was filled with irreversible resolution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Mu Chen’s gaze, Ling Xi lightly nodded her head, implying that he should not try to persuade her any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After looking for a long time, Mu Chen finally gave up and spoke with his teeth clenched, “Refine a Spirit Seal with your Spirit and give it to me. Otherwise, I will definitely not let you go alone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The so-called Spirit Seal was a small trace of Spirit that was made into a Spirit Seal. This Spirit Seal would be linked to the owner and the instant the owner was in danger, there would also be a reaction from the Spirit Seal as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this Spirit Seal was, after all, a strand of the Spirit. If the Spirit Seal was destroyed, the owner of it would also suffer injuries from it. So, generally speaking, unless it was someone close, most people wouldn’t be willing to give their Spirit Seals to anyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But clearly, Mu Chen and Ling Xi didn’t have a normal relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the firmness in Mu Chen’s eyes, Ling Xi could only agree to it as she revealed a weak smile from the corner of her lips. “What a stubborn fellow… okay then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She extended her hand as light gathered on her slender fingertips. It flickered with golden light and gradually took the form of a palm-sized golden seal. The golden seal was exquisite and small, it was a small-scaled Ling Xi. Even the cold aura that was emitted from it was similar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Here, take it.” Ling Xi revealed a smile to Mu Chen as she handed over the golden seal.</span></p>

After that, he saw Ling Xi’s face turning red as she glared at him.</span></p>

That rub and with their distance, she also felt that a little bit. Therefore, this action from the latter was merely teasing her right before her eyes. If it was someone else that did such a disrespectful act, Ling Xi would have long set up a Spiritual Array to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“*cough*…” Seeing her reaction, Mu Chen dryly coughed as he quickly stored the golden seal. He then said with a heavy expression, “Big Sister Ling Xi, promise me that no matter what happens, do not be rash. I will handle that matter in the future, and at that time, whether it is mother or Big Sister Ling Xi, I will protect the both of you.”</span></p>

It was a smile that made even a hundred flowers pale in comparison. However, Mu Chen’s words had also made her somewhat happy in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, even though you are a Sovereign now, you can’t abandon your cultivation in the ways of Spiritual Arrays. With your talent, you will probably soon come in contact with the profundity of Spiritual Array Grandmaster. This will also be a powerful card of yours. The danger filled in the Great Thousand World is something that the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy cannot be compared to. So it’s still good to have an additional card.” Ling Xi warned with a stern expression as she looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>

The latter had always maintained a calm expression as she stood there and did not come any closer, nor did she have any conversation with Ling Xi. Mu Chen did not know why the two ladies didn’t seem to like each other too much.</span></p>

Did you think that I’m unaware of anything as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you trying to say?” Nine Nether responded with a cold voice.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Nether Bird Clan has always been stubborn and old-fashioned. If you have an important place in the clan, and they were to find out that you conducted a Bloodlink Bond with a human, how enraged will they be? At that time, who knows, they might force Mu Chen to dissolve the Bloodlink Bond one-sidedly, because it fits the personality of your clan; but Mu Chen will also suffer an unimaginable injury this way.” Ling Xi coldly looked at Nine Nether as she spoke.</span></p>
