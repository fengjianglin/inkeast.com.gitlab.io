 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one thought that Mu Chen would actually be so courageous. Not only did he ascend to the ninth stair step, he even charged his way towards the tenth!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every expert swallowed a mouthful of saliva as they inwardly thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, the tenth flight of stairs is a gorge that can’t be crossed. Basically, no one can ascend it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the entire region was filled with cries of surprise, Cai Xiao’s face was somewhat pale as she watched this scene. Fresh blood splattered before her. Her mind became absent-minded as she watched the figure that was being annihilated. Her heart had instantly sunk down. She never thought that Mu Chen would risk his life to such a degree!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Didn’t he know that the tenth stair step was basically a death land? It wasn’t an issue with strength, but that stair step basically forbade anyone from ascending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, no matter how many outstanding geniuses there were in the past, they had only managed to reach the ninth stair step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the tenth stair step was perhaps the pride left behind by the True Dragon and Phoenix, a territory that forbade anyone from stepping onwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao’s face changed as she clenched her teeth and was about to go and save Mu Chen. However, just when she was about to move, the figure that was slowly collapsing suddenly stopped falling. He kneeled down to one knee as he unleashed a roar towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His yell was filled with pain, but it was also filled with unswerving determination and stubbornness. At this moment, white bones could be seen and practically half of his body had exploded. If it wasn’t for the powerful vitality bestowed to him by the The Dragon and Phoenix Blood Essences, his body would’ve been destroyed long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even at this moment, there wasn’t any despair of admitting defeat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The roar that sounded like that of a lion resounded in everyone’s ears. Countless experts showed shock in their eyes as they looked at the summit of the Dragon-Phoenix Stairs, at the figure that had a majority of his body destroyed. Even when he was bathed in blood, he still roared towards the sky. Not to mention ordinary experts, even Cai Xiao, Su Biyue, Hong Yu and Ding Xuan had their faces filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful willpower that Mu Chen had displayed made their hearts tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a ferocious person!” Ding Xuan was dumbfounded and couldn’t help giving him a thumbs-up. Compared to the fight between Mu Chen and the Netherworld Prince, he was even more admirable right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The roar had attracted the attention of countless experts, and at this moment, there was a bright draconic roar and phoenix cry that also resounded from the summit of the Dragon-Phoenix Stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was startled as they saw a majestic pillar of golden light soar towards the horizon at the end of the Dragon-Phoenix Stairs. In the pillar of golden light, it was Mu Chen who had one knee on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden pillar of light seemed to be filled with liquid. But with a clearer look, one would realise that those were dark-golden Dragon-Phoenix Blood Essences. Furthermore, their purity left many people shocked deep in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the whistling of the Dragon-Phoenix Blood Essences, it was like a rainstorm that cleansed Mu Chen’s nearly crumbled body. Layers of dark-gold constantly enveloped Mu Chen’s body as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the wounds, flesh could be seen growing at a visible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking from afar, Mu Chen was like a golden buddha with an ancient pressure vaguely being emitted from his body. It was an extremely pure oppressive force. The might originated from the True Dragon and Phoenix!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the… Dragon-Phoenix Blood Baptism!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was dumbfounded with their mouths wide open from the sudden change of events. Thereafter, the exclamations were covered up by dense envy. That’s because they felt how pure the True Dragon and Phoenix Blood Essences in the golden pillar of light were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a hundred Dragon-Phoenix Pools were incomparable to it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That brat’s life is too fortunate!” There were experts speaking out with their eyes turning red. It was the Dragon-Phoenix Blood Baptism, even someone with an extremely weak physique would be reborn after being wholly baptised by it. Not to mention that Mu Chen had a powerful physique, after this baptism, the strength of his body alone could probably confront those on the same cultivation as him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were envious, everyone knew that Mu Chen fought for it with his courage and willpower. That’s because, if they were in his place, they wouldn’t have the courage to face death and force their way up the stairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So the tenth stair step was a test.” Su Biyue, Hong Yu and Ding Xuan watched this scene with complicated gazes. They could clearly see better and from what they have felt, the tenth stair step was a sure death for anyone that dared to ascend it. Therefore, no one dared to ascend it after all these years, since no one was willing to take that risk. But this time, it was broken by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tenth stair step wasn’t a test of their strength, but their courage and willpower!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao felt relieved at this moment, while looking at the figure that was enveloped by the golden pillar of light with interest. Although he was young, the stubbornness and determination engraved deep in his bones even moved her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took a deep glance at Mu Chen. For some reason, she felt that not too long from now, the name of this youth before her would resound throughout the entire Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark-golden pillar of light enveloped Mu Chen’s figure. There were some pure True Dragon and Phoenix Blood Essences that came out from it, spreading to Cai Xiao, Su Biyue and the rest. Although it was incomparable to Mu Chen’s opportunity, it would be greatly beneficial for them if they managed to refine them. Immediately, they sat down and focused on absorbing those True Dragon and Phoenix Blood Essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the dark-golden pillar of light, a draconic roar and phoenix cry resounded in the sky. The pillar of light lasted nearly ten minutes, before it started to dissipate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single gaze was directed at the summit of the Dragon-Phoenix Stage in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that direction, the golden light gradually retracted into a figure that was kneeling on the ground with a single knee. There weren’t any clothes on the top of his body and the golden light flowed beneath his skin. His damaged body had already been completely restored. Furthermore, as the golden light flowed, there was an oppressive force that was vaguely spreading out.</span></p>

Spreading its wings, it seemed like it wanted to break out from Mu Chen’s body and soar into the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On his chest was a golden dragon tattoo, mightily overlooking down. As if it was overlooking this land and its prestige couldn’t be offended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly opened his eyes. His eyes, which were pitch-black, were golden at this moment, filled with a prestige that made others feel a suffocating pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden colour lasted for a while in his pupils, before it disappeared. Mu Chen looked down, blankly at a loss as he looked at his perfect and undamaged body. Gently clenching his fist, he could sense the terrifying power surging in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s as if the True Dragon and Phoenix were hidden within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He touched the dragon tattoo on his chest and his eyelids involuntarily twitched. That’s because he sensed that the True Dragon and Phoenix tattoo on his chest and back seemed to possess life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t look like plain tattoos but living creatures.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wounds that he had suffered from his fight with Liu Yan and the Netherworld Prince had long recovered, a recovery speed that even left him speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like, this time, he had won his gamble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the golden light dissipated in this region, there was numerous golden lights that gushed out from the altar. Those golden lights seemed to be dragon scales and phoenix feathers and, vaguely, ancient texts could be seen on those scales and feathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those are the inheritances left behind by the True Dragon and Phoenix!”</span></p>

Any one of those that were collected by the True Dragon and Phoenix would be greatly beneficial to their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dragon scales and phoenix feathers revolved above the Dragon-Phoenix Stage, enveloping the entire Dragon-Phoenix Stairs. So, evidently, Cai Xiao, Su Biyue and the rest could also obtain them. However, it was also evident that the higher they were on the Dragon-Phoenix Stairs, the inheritance that they could obtain would be more precious as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging from the golden light being emitted from those dragon scales and phoenix feathers, one could differentiate how powerful they were. The higher it was on the Dragon-Phoenix Stairs, the number of dragon scales and phoenix feathers would decrease in number. However, the light emitted from those were more powerful, as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Biyue, Hong Yu and Ding Xuan were a little surprised as they looked at the circulating dragon scales and phoenix feathers, impatiently wanting to try and take them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head as well. On the summit of the Dragon-Phoenix Stage, there was an extremely low number of dragon scales and phoenix feathers, there were only ten lumps of lights floating in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within those lumps of lights, dragon scales, dragon bones, phoenix feathers and various other items could be seen. Whether it was the ancient fluctuations being emitted from them, or the vastness of them, they were incomparable with the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stared at the ten lump of lights and could vaguely sense that he could choose only one of those inheritances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s brows knitted as he pondered for a long time, before slowly closing his eyes. Since it was so hard to make a choice, then he’d let nature take its course.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly opened his arms, and gradually calmed his heart as a faint golden light emitted from the surface of his body. Naturally, he had brought out the Dragon-Phoenix Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On his chest and back, the True Dragon and Phoenix tattoos gently wiggled as a golden beam of light shot out towards one of the ten lumps of light towards the extreme right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chee! Chee!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light wrapped onto the lump of light and swiftly retracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen opened his eyes and looked at the lump of golden light that was floating before him. He extended his hand out, and the golden lump of light fell into his hand. As the light dissipated, it revealed the item within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a dark-golden bone, filled with ancient runes, as if it was the most ancient wording in the world, emanating a profound fluctuation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen grabbed the mysterious dark-golden bone and felt the blood and flesh in his body stirring up. Shortly after, his gaze trembled, looking at the dark-golden bone that seemed to have a relationship with the Dragon-Phoenix Physique.</span></p>
