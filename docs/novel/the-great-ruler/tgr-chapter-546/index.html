At the rear of those three, Xue Tiandou and his party were eyeing the girls like prey and Mu Chen’s tightly shut eyes were finally slowly opening at this instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A chill flashed through his pair of black pupils.</span></p>

Amongst those gazes, the majority was filled with doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they could sense how powerful the Spiritual Array was from Mu Chen’s surroundings, there werw three Divine Wood Guards charging at him with the intention of exploding. Those three were comparable to three First Grade Spirit Disasters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow is indeed a Spiritual Array Master.” Wu Yingying looked at that figure as she clenched her teeth. However, there was a little shock in her heart. Mu Chen’s strength had already been revealed when he fought with Xue Tiandou earlier. But who could have expected that he also had the hidden identity of Spiritual Array Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yingying had no choice but to feel a little admiration for that fellow. No wonder that fellow’s name was widely spread in the Spiritual Road to the point that even her elder brother, Wu Ling, had high opinions of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, can this Spiritual Array really deal with the situation before him?” Wu Yingying shifted her gaze towards the three Divine Wood Guards that were about to explode as graveness filled her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away, despite the fact that the faces of Xue Tiandou, Wang Zhong and Mo Yu were a little dark, they still coldly swept a glance at Mu Chen as sneers were contained in their eyes. They had already paid the price of exploding three Divine Wood Guards in the current situation. That power was not something that Mu Chen and his party could handle with any methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll see how you will overturn this situation.” Xue Tiandou coldly smiled as he looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhuuu.</span></p>

Their faces were filled with solemn as they looked before them, before asking towards Mu Chen, “Do you have the confidence? If not, we’ll avoid it and deal with them later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need for that.”</span></p>

Although his voice wasn’t loud, it contained a trace of resolution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll go next, you guys stay beind me.” Mu Chen stood up as he took a step forth, standing in front of the two girls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the slender silhouette of that youth, Luo Li lightly smiled. Wen Qingxuan, however, cast her rosy lips aside as she looked unhappy. She did not need anyone to protect her, since she could deal with all these problems herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, staring at that silhouette that wasn’t broad but gave her a sense of security, she did not speak and only issued a soft snort, before directing her gaze elsewhere. She’d let this fellow be in the limelight. Later, when he could no longer handle the situation, she would act and let that fellow talk to her with respect next time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Imagining it, Wen Qingxuan’s lips could not help rising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was unaware of the two girl’s thoughts as he indifferently looked at the incoming three Divine Wood Guards. The Spiritual Energy ripples in their bodies had already reached a frightening degree. The feeling that those three gave him was similar to volcanos that were about to erupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He indifferently glanced at Xue Tiandou’s party that wasn’t far away. He did not speak as he formed some seals with a single hand and the gigantic Spiritual Array started to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

At the same time as those countless lights ntertwined, the Spiritual Energy in this region started to turn rampant as it frantically gathered together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huuuuu. Huuuuuuuuuu.</span></p>

The swaying appearances seemed like huge dragons twisting about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could sense the commotion coming from the Spiritual Array as their faces changed. Even Wen Qingxuan’s charming eyes froze. Although she previously felt that the Spiritual Array that Mu Chen was creating wasn’t a simple one, she did not expect it to have such power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that a Combination Diagram?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Astonishment flashed through Wen Qingxuan’s eyes. It was the Combination Diagram that caused their points to fall from being in first place. She had paid the highest price for this Combination Diagram and, clearly, she knew a portion of the Combination Diagram’s worth when she paid that sort of price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew that Mu Chen was a Spiritual Array Master. However, when she bought that Diagram for Mu Chen back then, she did not expect Mu Chen to be able to create it. After all, this Rank 5 Combination Diagram was something that was close to a Rank 6 Spiritual Array. Thus, it was difficult for Rank 5 Spiritual Array Masters to create it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Energy tornadoes formed in the Spiritual Array and, in the next instant, the tornadoes started to split apart as tornadoes of various size started to revolve at rapid speeds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz. Buzz.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sword ringing resounded as Spiritual Energy swords started to take form in the rapidly spinning tornadoes. Those swords did not have any physical forms, since they were all formed from the compressed boundless Spiritual Energy. The bodies of the swords trembled as they emitted fearsome Sword Aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Auras were extremely sharp as they even made the faces of Xue Tiandou’s group change as they felt the sharpness harbored in the Sword Auras. Although the Sword Auras were incomparable to the slash that Luo Li had unleashed earlier, the amount of swords in the Spiritual Array had already reached hundreds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This formation was something that could make the scalp of one tingle.</span></p>
