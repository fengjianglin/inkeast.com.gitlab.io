After the dragons roared, they had immediately pounced towards the Divine Pavilion Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, fear uncontrollably surged on the face of the Divine Pavilion Master and a deep regret poured from his heart. He never thought that his idea of using the power of the Skyeater Evil Emperor to break through would actually cause him such a disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he did not expect that the Fourth Palace Master, whom had already died, would leave such a card behind…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s all because of that damnable brat!”</span></p>

If it wasn’t for the fact that Mu Chen had previously awakened the Spiritual Puppet, he would have probably suppressed the other Earth Sovereigns and obtain the final victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, it was futile, no matter how much regret he felt. The starlight dragons of flames charged over. The peculiar factor was that there wasn’t a high temperature pouring over, and yet the expression on the Divine Pavilion Master grew even more fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because, despite looking fine on the surface, his insides had already turned completely. Especially the Sovereign Sea within his body, the Spiritual Energy violently surged. It vaguely wanted to go out of his control and break out of the Sovereign Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you want?! Don’t go too far, if you want to go at a life-and-death struggle, both of us will not have a good time!” The Divine Pavilion Master sensed the changes in his Sovereign Sea and his face drastically changed as he clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. You want to have a life-and-death struggle with a dead man like me?” Outside the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid, the Fourth Palace Master laughed out before his gaze turned cold. “I have previously mentioned not to take things that don’t belong to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the seals of the Fourth Palace Master changed. The starlight flames surged, turning into innumerable streaks of flames that entered through the pores and nose of the Divine Pavilion Master and into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arghhh!”</span></p>

A massive beam of Spiritual Energy gushed out from his mouth. The Spiritual Energy was dense and showed signs of substance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Spiritual Energy from the Sovereign Sea of the Divine Pavilion Master!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the fluctuation of the Spiritual Divine Liquid!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The means of the Fourth Palace Master was actually so overbearing to actually refine and extract the Spiritual Divine Liquid that the Divine Pavilion Master had previously absorbed. This way, the Divine Pavilion Master would definitely be beaten back to his initial cultivation without the Spiritual Divine Liquid!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What deep scheming from the Fourth Palace Master, to leave such a hand behind!” When Mandala and the rest saw this scene, their eyes uncontrollably squinted and their faces weren’t looking too good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?” Mu Chen was unsure of what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Spiritual Divine Liquid that we have previously refined have been secretly imprinted by the Fourth Palace Master. It’s extremely hidden to the point that we weren’t able to sense it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s face turned grave as she continued, “But there’s no sinister intention behind that imprint. As time passes, it should disappear from our bodies. But… before that, if it’s controlled by the Fourth Palace Master, he would be able to easily extract it from our bodies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s heart was stunned. It was no wonder why the Fourth Palace Master could revert the Divine Pavilion Master back to his initial state so easily, so it turns out he had left such a hand behind. But fortunately, he was only targeting the Divine Pavilion Master. Otherwise, Mandala and the other Earth Sovereigns would be deeply affected by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Palace Master was truly not a simple figure to be able to become one of the pinnacle figures in the Ancient Haven Palace. This time, the Divine Palace Master was thoroughly doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they spoke, along with the boundless beam of light charging out of the Divine Pavilion Master’s body in the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid, the Spiritual Energy fluctuation around him furiously dropped and, in just a few moments, he had dropped from the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm down to the Lesser Earth Sovereign Realm…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This way, the Divine Pavilion Master’s bitter battle in this Hunting War was all for nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the Divine Pavilion Master had frozen for an instant due to the drastic changes in his body. Thereafter, a crimson light surged in his eyes. He had waited for god-knows how many years to be able to reach the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm. But right now, all his efforts had been completely destroyed by the Fourth Palace Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a blow was something that he couldn’t bear, even with his composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fourth Palace Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Pavilion Master roared, his voice was filled with viciousness as it soared into the clouds and the violent Spiritual Energy that surged out of his body had caused the surround starry skies to distort. The shackles that bound onto him had completely shattered as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow is insane, he actually wants to erupt his Sovereign Sea!” When Mandala and the rest saw this scene, their faces drastically changed. The Divine Pavilion Master was so insane to even erupt his own Sovereign Sea, he was simply neglecting his life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too far away, when every one of the Divine Pavilion factions saw this scene, their faces turned pale and their gazes were grey with despair. At this moment, their Divine Pavilion probably couldn’t stand still in the Northern Region anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Divine Pavilion Master had no time to be bothered with the Divine Pavilion. He frantically looked at the sky as cracks started to appear on the surface of his body and light seeped out of the cracks. In the next instant, the light brilliantly burst out and the body of the Divine Pavilion Master exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable Spiritual Energy shock wave wreaked havoc. The starry skies had shattered and the entire Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid violently trembled. Ripples appeared on the surface of the dark-golden pyramid, as if it was about to shatter from the terrifying Spiritual Energy shock wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even at this moment, when the Divine Pavilion Master had been reverted back to the Lesser Earth Sovereign Realm, if he was insane enough to erupt his own Sovereign Sea, the destructive power would be a disaster. If it wasn’t for the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid suppressing it, practically everyone outside would be dead by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Palace Master looked at the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid that seemed to be on the verge of breaking and slightly knitted his brows. Clearly, the insane actions of the Divine Pavilion Master had exceeded his expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid was destroyed, the Divine Pavilion Master’s Spirit, which was imprisoned within, would be able to escape and if he cultivated right from the start again, he would definitely be a considerable threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Going for a life-and-death struggle with a dead person like me, I’m afraid your calculations are wrong.”</span></p>

He had already died a long time ago. He was only a mere strand of consciousness supporting the Spiritual Puppet. Since the Divine Pavilion Master was so bold, then what was there to hesitate for him, who was the Overlord of the Northern Region?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As thoughts processed in his mind, the Fourth Palace Master had formed seals with his hands and in the next instant, the body of the Spiritual Puppet had suddenly exploded and a terrifying current of Spiritual Energy whistled out and poured into the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the support of the astonishing Spiritual Energy from the Fourth Palace Master, the trembling from the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid had gradually calmed down. Roughly more than ten breaths later, the explosion impact from the Divine Pavilion Master had been completely suppressed.</span></p>

But at this moment, fear had finally surged on his face.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid, space fluctuated and a spiritual figure appeared, it was the Fourth Palace Master. He looked down with indifference at the Divine Pavilion Master and faintly said, “Anyone polluted by the Fiend Clans is a traitor of the Great Thousand World. The Lord of the Ancient Haven Palace has already ordered to destroy the souls of such people!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the Fourth Palace Master no longer hesitated and his seals changed, activating the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid. Instantly, traces of starlight energy descended and turned into a triangle with ancient runes that emitted a terrifying power to suppress anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want to blame someone, then blame yourself for being unscrupulous!”</span></p>

In just a few breaths of time, it was already the size of a palm, before an explosion rang out and had quickly exploded, before being reduced to sparkles of light in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and the rest were dumbfounded as they saw the innumerable fragments. They couldn’t help feeling their scalps going numb. Who could have expected that the strongest powerhouse in the Northern Region would actually be killed by the Fourth Palace Master at this moment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was mostly due to the power of the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid, it still showed how powerful was he, who was once a ruler of the Northern Region.</span></p>

Furthermore, by relying on Mandala’s strength, which was at the Quasi-Greater Earth Sovereign Realm, the fame of their Great Havenlaw Domain would undoubtedly soar in the Northern Region. It was so much so that they would even exceed the Divine Pavilion and become the strongest powerhouse in the Northern Region!</span></p>
