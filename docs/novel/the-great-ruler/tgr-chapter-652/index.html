 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smear of shock flashed through Mu Chen’s eyes. He actually couldn’t believe it. That white-clothed girl had actually concealed such profound strength. However, his thoughts didn’t linger about it that much. In the Great Thousand World, it was a place with crouching tigers and hidden dragons. Without any background, how could a young girl like her dare to act so wildly in the outside world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t think much about it.” Mu Chen smiled. He didn’t think so profoundly when he helped earlier, he just didn’t wish to see a beautiful girl being involved with unnecessary trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he heard about how deep the water was in the Merchant Continent. Even if that girl had a background, it probably couldn’t endure that sort of trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether smiled and did not speak anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them passed many streets, and through a street corner, their sights suddenly widened. Before them stood a large palace that had a massive amount of Spiritual Energy emitting from it, forming a pillar of light that soared into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the palace, there was a massive amount of people flowing through. Seeing the humans flowing at that location, even Mu Chen couldn’t help being a little dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Auction House of Merchant City…” Nine Nether raised her head as she looked at the words made of golden light and smiled, “It should be this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a terrifying scale.” Mu Chen sighed. The palace was like a giant beast that opened its mouth to devour the endless flow of people without the slightest sign of overflowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”This palace…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze suddenly flashed when he looked at the great palace. Astonishment grew in his eyes. He realised a peculiar fluctuation being emitted from the great palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a Divine Artifact.” A smear of surprise had also flashed through Nine Nether’s eyes as she continued, “What a huge sum, to use a Divine Artifact as an auction house…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This palace wasn’t a building, but a Divine Artifact, so peculiar ripples were coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Formidable.” Mu Chen involuntarily praised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether waved her hand as she led Mu Chen into the majestic palace. Upon entering, they could clearly feel the spatial ripples around them. Their sight had slightly blurred, before clearing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The interior of the palace was exceptionally well lit. The ground seemed to have been forged with brilliant crystals. There was a multitude of people spread around here, but even though there were so many people gathered here, it wasn’t even slightly crowded; instead, it was abnormally vast in size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen walked into the palace as he looked around. The astonished appearance he had displayed made him feel a little like a country bumpkin. Compared to the Spiritual Points Hall of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, this place was several times wider and was even more stunning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether did not stay here for long. She had directly handed over ten drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid to a lady on the counter. She received two entry tickets to the auction as she pulled Mu Chen through the hall, into a light door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the light door was a field similar to an arena, the size of it was enormous and was sufficient to hold tens of thousands of people. Also, it was filled with heads. The population in this place had reached a dreadful degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen pulled his lips, but he did not make an exclamation, since he was already numb to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether searched for seats, while Mu Chen shifted his head. He was looking towards the right, not too far away. There was another light door as many silhouettes walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those people walked in, Mu Chen could clearly sense many gazes directed over with a little heat in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked over as well as he saw a foxy lady with an exceptionally alluring and explosive figure. Her hair was red and an alluring smile hung on her oval face that rippled the hearts of those that looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady was twisting her waist like a snake as she walked, and as she strode, she attracted many gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the girl was an ordinary-looking middle-aged man. When he walked, he maintained a step distance from the lady. When he occasionally raised his head, heart-alarming rays of light flashed through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at that middle-aged man, and his heart slightly shook. He felt pressure from the latter. The middle-aged man that seemed ordinary had a mighty strength, he had probably at least reached the level of Fourth Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are from the Celestial Fox Sect. The Celestial Fox Sect is a peak power in the Merchant Continent with powerful strength. Many of the auction houses in this continent has their traces in it.” A light voice came from Nine Nether, who was by Mu Chen’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That lady should have a significant position in the Celestial Fox Sect. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have a Fourth Grade Sovereign following her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Celestial Fox Sect…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen imprinted that name into his heart, it could be considered the first dominant force that he had heard of since entering the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and Nine Nether were looking over, they were sensed by the middle-aged man that stood beside the foxy lady. He raised his head, glancing at Mu Chen and Nine Nether. When his gaze stopped on Nine Nether, he couldn’t help stopping his steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his actions were small, it was noticed by the foxy lady, and she looked over, fixing her gaze on Mu Chen and Nine Nether with her alluring gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing that alluring gaze, Mu Chen felt his heart beating faster. It was so much so that even the blood in his body flowed faster. But, quickly, he sensed that something wasn’t right. He focused his gaze, and a roar of thunder seemed to be ringing out from his body as he suppressed that strange feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That foxy lady slightly exclaimed and she no longer made any actions. She only revealed a slight smile at Mu Chen and Nine Nether. After that, she walked to the front of the auction house, and under the countless heated gazes, she walked into a small pavilion that was covered with tulle. Clearly, it wasn’t a place that just anyone that was ordinary could enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering the pavilion, the foxy lady revealed a slight smile as she spoke, “Uncle Liu, those two seem unfamiliar. They shouldn’t be from the Merchant Continent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That lady is very powerful. I’m afraid that her strength isn’t any weaker than mine. As for that youth, he should have just stepped into the Sovereign Realm. Having such an achievement at his age is also pretty good,” said the ordinary-looking middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the middle-aged man claiming that Nine Nether’s strength wasn’t any weaker than his own, the foxy lady felt surprised. However, her expression quickly returned to normal as she nodded her head, without speaking any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop looking, with your current ability, I’m afraid she might not even look at you.” Looking at Mu Chen staring at the foxy lady, Nine Nether lightly snorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was helpless and didn’t bother to explain. Just when he found a place to sit down, he heard a familiar evident roar of anger coming from not far away, “Get lost, this young master is not interested in guys!”</span></p>

He saw a white-clothed girl disguised as a man at another door to the auction, her face was cold at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before her, stood a similarly white-clothed youth. That youth looked a little feminine, but his appearance was also handsome. At this moment, his face wasn’t too natural from the roar of the white-clothed girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, when he saw that girl, although she was disguised as a man, he was someone experienced in chasing after flowers. Thus, he could see through the disguise with an eye. Furthermore, the girl had a delicate feature that was emitting a charming spirituality. When she grows up in the future, she would definitely possess an earth-shattering appearance. That was the reason why he went up to strike a conversation. But he never expected that before he could even speak, he was shouted at without the slightest politeness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you must have misunderstood me, lady. I am not with bad intentions, I just want to invite you together to watch the auction, seeing that you’re alone.” But this feminine youth also wasn’t any ordinary playboy. Even after being roared at, he still maintained a gentle smile as he spoke with elegance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not interested.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his courtesy attitude wasn’t practical to the white-clothed girl. The girl only gave him a glance, rejected him straight up, and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feminine youth finally slightly knitted his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing behind him was a black-clothed elder. He did not have any expression on his face as he blocked the path of the white-clothed girl and spoke in a faint voice, “My young master has invited this lady, you should agree to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the situation, the white-clothed girl frowned her brows in an instant. However, just when she was about to push a palm out, a hand had extended before her and held onto her wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden contact made the white-clothed girl turn stiff and wanted to swiftly struggle free. However, when she saw the familiar face that she had previously encountered, only then did she weaken her struggles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, my little sister is ignorant, I hope the two of you will not mind her.” Mu Chen stood before the white-clothed girl as he gave a gentle smile towards the youth and black-clothed elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feminine youth narrowed his eyes as he stared at Mu Chen, before casting a glance at Nine Nether, who stood beside him. Ib an instant, a lustre glowed from the depth of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before he could say anything, the black-clothed elder took half a step forth as he blocked the youth and Nine Nether. When looking at the latter, he had his guard up in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, he had sensed the threat from Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at this scene, the feminine youth slightly frowned his brows as he gave a look of a smile yet not a smile to Mu Chen and Nine Nether. He did not continue speaking, but turned around and left with a faint smile. Furthermore, the area that he walked towards was a pavilion at the most front of the auction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The background of those two isn’t simple. If I am not wrong, they should be from the Sky Profound Palace of the Skylaw Continent.” Looking at their silhouettes, Nine Nether spoke in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sky Profound Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s also one of the peak forces of our Skylaw Continent. It's not any weaker than our Great Havenlaw Domain,” said Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly shook his head. He never thought that before reaching the Skylaw Continent, he had already offended a peak force. Although that feminine youth displayed generosity, he knew that that person’s heart probably wasn’t that big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, let go of me!” The white-clothed girl named Lin Jing quickly broke free from Mu Chen’s grasp when she saw the departure of those two. She held onto her wrist as she stared at Mu Chen with spirituality filled in her pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen loosened his grip as he helplessly said, “You’re truly a demoness at causing trouble wherever you go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Lin Jing unhappily pouted her mouth as she said with a little grievance, “How have I caused trouble? I don’t even know that bastard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, that bastard actually dared to take advantage of this young master. This is too fed up, I must tell dad about this! No, I must tell Uncle Leopard and Uncle Tiger! Let them thrash that bastard to death for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jing clenched her teeth as she continued to curse. He’s probably the first one that dared to take advantage of her the instant he met her and a bastard that still had such a good feeling about himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the girl’s curses, Mu Chen helplessly flung his mouth as he no longer bothered with her and left for the front together with Nine Nether.</span></p>
