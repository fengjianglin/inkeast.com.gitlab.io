 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the desert that stretched as far as the eye could see, the end was finally starting to appear. At the end of it was a massive scarlet light that enveloped down. It was a naturally formed barrier that split heavens and earth apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The temperature of the scarlet light was clearly extremely high, and as the lustre spread out, it had caused space to distort, as if it wanted to incinerate everything within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scarlet light that spread out in the desert was nothing compared to this scarlet barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there were several silhouettes that stood in the sky before the scarlet barrier and their faces were somewhat unsightly as they looked at the scarlet barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the barrier that leads to the second level…”</span></p>

But even so, his entire body was covered in beads of sweat and his skin was extremely dry. Even his face had turned abnormally red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another corner of this region, Mo Feng, Han Shan of the Demonic Rhino Clan and Xu Kun of the Sky Elephant Clan had arrived and they looked at the scarlet barrier before them with grave expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could naturally sense how hard it would be for them to get through this scarlet barrier. The high temperature was something that even they wouldn’t dare to underestimate. If they were careless, they might be stripped of a layer of skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind them, there were still several streaks of light flying over, but facing the obstruction of this scarlet barrier, no one dared to enter for the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the scarlet barrier only seemed to envelop a thousand feet in radius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was at a normal time, it would only take a blink of an eye for them to travel this distance. But in this place, a thousand feet was similar to the path of death, which made them feel fearful…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silence in this region lasted for a long time, before everyone decided not to stay any longer. Zong Teng was the first to gnashed his teeth and did not speak a word. His body blossomed with a golden lustre and a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him. On the surface of his body, golden layers of feathers started to appear that enveloped him like armour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After utilising this defence, Zong Teng was still not assured, but he tossed the golden umbrella in his hand. As the golden light flickered, a golden lustre had enveloped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After fortifying himself with layers of defences, only then did Zong Teng feel assured and he stepped into the scarlet light without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tssssk! Tsssk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant when he stepped into the scarlet light, Zong Teng’s face had instantly distorted as a cloud of white smoke rose from his body. Even the golden layers of feathers had started to melt at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intense pain had made Zong Teng feel like his scalp was exploding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zong Teng was, after all, a genius of the Sky Roc Clan. So he would naturally not retreat so easily, since he had activated all his defences and charged towards the scarlet light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, when Han Shan and Xu Kun saw this scene, they didn’t want to allow Zong Teng to get through, so they had brought out their various means, fortifying themselves and charged out as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arghhhh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But evidently, there was someone that underestimated the scarlet light. Soon after they stepped into it, they had issued a shriek after being burnt. As the white smoke rose, it practically felt like he was burning. Although his entire body wasn’t incinerated, the Spiritual Energy in his body had dimmed down and he had clearly been heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This commotion had caused the hearts of Han Shan and the rest to shiver and they became even more careful, slowing down their speed as they tried to move through the scarlet light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Zong Teng and the rest were slowly moving through the scarlet light, they had suddenly looked towards the distance at their rear and their brows lightly knitted together. At that moment, they had felt a peculiar Spiritual Energy fluctuation spreading out…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did someone come?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like Zong Teng, Han Shan and the rest have reached the end of the first level. As long as they can endure this, they will be able to move on to the second level…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone outside the Body Refining Pagoda was immersed in a discussion as they watched the light dots slow down. But they weren’t worried, since Zong Teng, Han Shan and the rest were all geniuses of their clans, thus they came well-prepared. As long as they’re careful, it should be a certainty for them to get to the second level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While everyone was paying attention to Zong Teng and the rest, an exclamation suddenly rang out, “That Mu Chen has increased his speed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was startled and had shifted their eyes and saw that the dot of light that was slowly travelling behind the others had started to speed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh. Finally moving? But by the time he catches up to them, the rest will probably be on the second level. Such an achievement, don’t mention about obtaining any opportunities.” When Liu Qing of the Sky Roc Clan saw this scene, she mocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she finished speaking, a commotion broke out in the surrounding and many experts had a change in their expressions. That’s because they could see the dot of light travelling at an unbelievable speed. It was speeding towards the end of the first level so swiftly that the long torment on the first level no longer seemed to obstruct him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a fast speed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s going even faster than Zong Teng and the rest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to this speed, he will probably soon catch up to Zong Teng, Han Shan and the rest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is that possible? He isn’t afraid of the torment on the first level by travelling at this speed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exclamations incessantly resounded and everyone had disbelief on their faces. They did not expect that the person that they had practically given up on would be so mighty all of a sudden at this moment…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Qing’s face had turned pale from the commotion and her gaze was fixed onto the swiftly moving light dot, before gnashing her teeth. “What’s the use of travelling so fast? In the end, he still won’t be able to get through the first barrier!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another corner, Nine Nether and Mo Ling felt heavily relieved of breath. Since that was the case, Mu Chen still had the chance to strive with the rest. It’s just that they didn’t know what that fellow was doing when he was moving like a snail…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under everyone’s attention, the last dot, which was lagging behind, was swiftly catching up to the other nine dots of light…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the massive barrier of scarlet light, Zong Teng and the rest were carefully moving with the layers of defences covering them, obstructing the terrifying dissolving energy of the scarlet light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And at this moment, their faces had suddenly changed and they had abruptly turned their heads back. They were shocked to see a silhouette flying over from the distant sky. In just ten-odd breaths, he was already outside the scarlet barrier.</span></p>

Who was so daring to travel so fast under the terrifying scarlet light, wasn’t he afraid of being incinerated to ashes?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s that human brat!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s pupils contracted and his eyes turned darker. At the same time, he felt a little disbelief. How did Mu Chen manage to catch up in such a short period of time after being shaken off by them? This speed was something that even he was inferior to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mo Feng saw this scene, he felt relieved in his heart. Mu Chen was truly a person that brought one surprise after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, so what if he managed to catch up. The scarlet light here is several times more powerful than the light outside. With the physique of a human, he will be dissolved by the scarlet light if he dares to step in.” Someone coldly snorted in their heart. Clearly, that person did not think that Mu Chen would dare to enter the barrier of scarlet light. After all, even they had to use several defences before they could slowly move in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as they coldly snorted, Mu Chen lightly smiled outside the scarlet barrier, before he stepped into the scarlet light under numerous widened eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s simply courting death! He actually dared to enter based on his physical body, without even utilising his Spiritual Energy?!” When they saw how he moved, several people had widened their eyes and waited for Mu Chen to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sizzle! Sizzle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen stepped into the scarlet light, the terrifying temperature immediately corroded over, which made him feel like he was suffocating as a white smoke immediately rose on the surface of his body. His skin was being burnt and destroyed as a sizzling noise resounded, making one’s hair to stand from his body, as he was being incinerated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying pain had wreaked havoc once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s face instantly distorted, but he immediately pulled the corner of his lips. The scarlet light was clearly more overbearing than it was outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his resistance for the scarlet light had already been greatly strengthened through the period of having his body previously burnt and the powerful adaptability from the Dragon-Phoenix Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when he raised his head, he gently smiled when he looked at those pitying and ridiculing gazes. Shortly after, the True Dragon Tattoo on his chest wandered and his entire body felt like it was awakening at this moment. As his muscles twitched, it was absorbing the scarlet light energy that entered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body seemed to show signs of strengthening once again.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of Zong Teng, Han Shan and the rest suddenly contracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the surface of Mu Chen’s body was emitting a golden light and his skin was as good as before. Not only did the scarlet light not cause any destruction to his body, but it had also even reflected a peculiar dark-golden light on the surface of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful dissolving scarlet light didn’t seem to be doing anything to Mu Chen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is this possible?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Murmurs of disbelief resounded from everyone’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, Mu Chen couldn’t be bothered about the shock in their hearts. He slowly clenched his fist and the corner of his lips gently rose when he saw everyone travelling like turtles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, looks like I will be taking a step ahead this time.”</span></p>

In the blink of an eye, he had already shaken Zong Teng and the rest far behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As everyone looked at his speeding figure, their gazes were stunned and couldn’t recover from their astonishment for a long time.</span></p>
