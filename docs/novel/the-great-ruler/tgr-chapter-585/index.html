 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The primordial hawk cry earlier was the best proof. As everyone knew how powerful Mu Chen’s black lightning was, Ji Xuan was still able to withstand it unharmed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The trump card that Ji Xuan had concealed was clearly very fearsome.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen’s strength only appeared to be Spiritual Energy Disaster, his fighting power was something that could heavily change the expression of any expert here and cautiously deal with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, an opponent like Mu Chen was someone that even the monstrous Ji Xuan would have to fear a little, fearing for a tragic battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was the case, even if he had managed to defeat Mu Chen, he still had to pay a huge price for it. When it comes down to that, he still had to deal with the enraged Luo Li and the Wen Qingxuan, whose stances were unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the two absolute beauties, even Ji Xuan was not confident that he could win.

It was just pushed back a little… because Ji Xuan was waiting, waiting for the finals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the finals, he would be able to reveal all of his trump cards without any fear.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that time comes, it would definitely be a ferocious battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Mu Chen was calmly looking at Ji Xuan as he departed. He slowly eased his tense body as a faint smear of paleness flinted across his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a great exhaustion for him to execute three Divine Arts, the Divine Wheel of the Heavenly Wood, Divine Wood Scripture, as well as the Lightning Controlling Art, with his cultivation at Spiritual Energy Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also fortunate that he was able to reach Spiritual Energy Disaster, allowing the Spiritual Energy within his body to grow by several times. If he was still at the Human Body Disaster, it would definitely be impossible for him to achieve such a feat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He directed his sight towards the direction that Ji Xuan left with a calm expression. However, hints of sharpness were surging in the depth of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The confrontation could be considered a little as having a strong start, but a weak finish. However, it had also allowed him to know how powerful Ji Xuan was. This opponent of the past had become so deep and unpredictable now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a formidable opponent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly clenched his fist as he muttered to himself, “Spiritual Energy Disaster is still insufficient…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During their confrontation, Mu Chen could feel that Ji Xuan had hidden many things. The depth of his strength shouldn’t be at this level. Thus, it made Mu Chen feel for the first time that his strength was still insufficient, especially his Spiritual Energy. Compared to Ji Xuan, who was at the Third Grade Spirit Disaster, he was still too inferior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he could shorten the distance with his physical body, Spiritual Energy was the most crucial. If he wished to unleash more powerful trump cards, he would require the larger support of Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, if he wished to thoroughly defeat Ji Xuan, he would definitely have to raise his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inhaled a mouthful of air as he suppressed the waves in his heart as he softly muttered, “The Finals… it should be very soon. Ji Xuan, let us unleash all of our trump cards at that time and let us see who will have the last laugh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silence in this region lasted for a long time. The torrential killing intent had also thoroughly dissipated, allowing all the powerful teams to be relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They exchanged looks as they strangely looked at Mu Chen, who was up in the sky. Some teams had already started to leave. As the battle had already ended, there was no reason for them to remain any longer, in case they would be targeted by the other powerful teams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having this thought, whooshing sounds rang out in the sky as the other teams left in an orderly manner. Even when they left, they maintained their guard to the highest level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a few minutes, this region that had gathered countless teams had emptied out, leaving behind the destruction and the broken mountain peaks as proof that a huge battle had occurred in this location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you're indeed formidable for someone that is fancied by the next Empress of the Luo God Clan.” Xue Tianhe said as he smiled towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen faintly glanced at Xue Tianhe as he replied, “Your Blood God Clan must be bored to have traveled such a distance just to participate in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even the next Empress of the Luo God Clan is here, there’s nothing odd of us being here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Tianhe then directed his gaze towards Luo Li as a chill flashed across his scarlet pupils. He pursed up his lips as he smiled, “She’s the hope of the Luo God Clan now. If I could kill her, the Luo God Clan would be thoroughly hopeless…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Mu Chen’s gaze turned extremely terrifying. The gaze that he had used to look at Ji Xuan earlier was vastly incomparable to his current one as it had made Xue Tianhe narrow his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I can only slaughter your trash here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A savage smile surfaced on Mu Chen’s charming face. A red light flashed across his pupils as torrential killing intent spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The startling killing intent that was suddenly unleashed by Mu Chen made everyone here alarmed. They involuntarily shifted their gazes towards Xue Tianhe’s party. Clearly, they were unaware of how Xue Tianhe’s party suddenly provoked Mu Chen to such a degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li’s figure moved as she appeared beside Mu Chen. Her crystal-clear pupils were exceptionally cold at this moment as her hand that was gripping her Luo God Sword had tiny tremblings as a sword cry rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, Su Xuan and the rest below were also fixating their eyes on Xue Tianhe’s party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan swept a gaze at Xue Tianhe as she softly snorted. A golden warspear appeared in her hand as it was inclined, pointing downwards. The golden battle armor wrapped around her as it flaunted her startling figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Xue Tianhe saw the reaction that the other party had from his words, he narrowed his eyes as he looked at Liu Qingxun and Fang Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Liu Qingxun and Fang Yun saw Xue Tianhe’s gaze, they smiled. However, they did not have any intentions to help as they tapped their feet on the air and flew away.</span></p>
