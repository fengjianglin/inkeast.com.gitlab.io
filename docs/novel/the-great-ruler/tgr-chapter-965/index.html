 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two months from now, let’s head to the Nine Netherbird Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Towards Mu Chen’s choice, Mandala wasn’t too surprised. She took a glance at the former. “But what Elder Tianque said is correct. With your current strength, it won’t be easy for you to obtain the fourth quota if you do not use the power of Battle Will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was merely a Fifth Grade Sovereign and within the Nine Netherbird Clan, the two other talented figures that were competing over the last quota were stronger than Liu Qing. So they must have already touched the Seventh Grade Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adding their physique as a Divine Beast, their fighting power was even more extraordinary. So if Mu Chen wanted to win against them and obtain the quota, then it would definitely be difficult. Furthermore… even if he managed to win, if he wanted to help Nine Nether obtain the Divine Blood of the Undying Bird, then he would have to face the other talented figures of the Divine Beast Clans and there might even be powerful existences amongst them. And with Mu Chen’s current cultivation at the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm, it was undoubtedly somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala had spoken the truth and Mu Chen did not show any difficulty on his face, but lightly smiled. “That’s true, but…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t I still have two months?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala and the three Emperors heard his words, they instantly squinted their eyes, before they looked at Mu Chen with their eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw their gazes, he lightly nodded his head. Back then, when he used the Fallen Origin Pellets to break through to the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm, it was half a year ago and he did not forcefully make his breakthrough and chose to nurture the Spiritual Energy in his body. Over the last six months, the Spiritual Energy in his body had already quietly reached perfection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his recent cultivation, he could sense that the Spiritual Energy in his Sovereign Sea had reached full capacity and the shaky feeling that he previously had when he made his breakthrough had completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he could already make another breakthrough at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s just that I might need the Domain Ruler’s help.” Mu Chen looked at Mandala as he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Speak.” Mandala waved her hand, appearing to be extremely grand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I might need quite a bit of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid for this breakthrough, so I’d like to borrow one million drops Sovereign Spiritual Liquid from you.” Mu Chen said as he chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he made his breakthrough, he required a large amount of Spiritual Energy. Since the Fallen Origin Pellets have been completely exhausted, he could only resort to Sovereign Spiritual Liquids. But Mu Chen’s wallet was empty regarding this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Nine Nether Palace had been expanding at a great rate recently, with the number of cities under them having also reached the first amongst the Kings, it didn’t mean that Mu Chen was rich. That’s because, as the Nine Nether Palace expanded, they also had to exhaust a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. Furthermore, it wasn’t time for the cities to submit their tributes. Along those lines, the Nine Nether Palace couldn’t show any intention in squeezing them dry before they could fully digest all the cities. Otherwise, some of the cities under them would start to rebel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One million drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid? Okay, I will have someone deliver them later.” Regarding Mu Chen’s request, Mandala did not have the slightest doubt. After all, Mu Chen had greatly contributed in the Hunting War and his contributions weren’t something that merely expanding the Nine Nether Palace could make up for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh, you’re someone that belongs to my Great Havenlaw Domain. So when you go to the Nine Netherbird Clan, do not let those fellows underestimate you. Therefore, speak any request you have, our Great Havenlaw Domain will do our best to fulfil your requests.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw how generous Mandala was, he couldn’t help smiling and briefly pondered before spoke again. He really wasn’t going to be modest. “Since that’s the case, then I need to trouble Domain Ruler to help me collect Spiritual Array Diagrams. If possible, a Heaven Grade Spiritual Array…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heaven Grade Spiritual Array?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she heard those four words, Mandala’s golden pupils flashed with a light and shortly after, she examined Mu Chen, before she slowly said, “You can already lay a Heaven Grade Spiritual Array? Doesn’t that mean… that you’re now a Heaven Grade Spiritual Array Master?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Array Masters were classified in Heaven, Earth and Human, three grades that represented the Nine Grades of the Sovereign Realm. In the past, the four lotuses that Mu Chen had laid out, which was the Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array, was only an Earth Grade Spiritual Array. At that time, he had clearly not reached the Heaven Grade Spiritual Array Master level. It was so much so that it had been some time since Mu Chen last used a Spiritual Array on his enemy, causing Mandala to forget the fact that Mu Chen was also a Spiritual Array Master…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, when Mu Chen mentioned this matter, only then did they realise that the Battle Formation Master was a branch of the Spiritual Array Master and Mu Chen was naturally talented in his attainments in Spiritual Arrays as well. Otherwise, how could he have such swift improvements in Battle Will?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Emperors were also startled as they looked at Mu Chen. If Mu Chen could truly lay out a Heaven Grade Spiritual Array, even the lowest one could confront a Seventh Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regarding the doubtful gazes of Mandala and the three Emperors, Mu Chen gently smiled. “Although it’s still somewhat shaky, there are some senses. If there is a Heaven Grade Spiritual Array for me to study, I should be able to achieve some improvements.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In recent years, although he did not cultivate in the path of Spiritual Arrays, that didn’t mean that he could no longer use it. It’s just that he had prioritised cultivating other areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, after coming in contact with Battle Will, he realised the similarities between both. When he was studying Battle Will, he would also have some comprehension on Spiritual Arrays, which caused his attainments in the ways of Spiritual Arrays to unconsciously rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he did not pay much attention to it in the past and he had to partake in the Hunting War. Therefore, Mu Chen had no time to find a Heaven Grade Spiritual Array to study. Right now, he was clearly paying more attention to it, since it would definitely be a trump card that would help Nine Nether obtain the Undying Bird’s Divine Blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you have concealed quite a bit… It’s no wonder why you would dare to accept this task.” Mandala’s eyes flickered with a bizarre light as she felt inwardly relieved. Only then was she rest assured to have Mu Chen go to the Divine Beast Origin. After all, amongst the powerful Divine and Spiritual Beast Clans, the geniuses weren’t fools that could easily be dealt with and they would definitely be stronger than the younger generations of the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since that’s the case, then you have to go to this Divine Beast Origin. It’s undoubtedly a great opportunity for you and you might even break through the second level of the Dragon-Phoenix Sutra…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard those words, his heart trembled. The Dragon-Phoenix Sutra not only allowed him to form the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, it even bestowed him the tattoos of the True Dragon and Phoenix, which had granted a great amount of help to Mu Chen. The True Dragon Tattoos bestowed him powerful offensive abilities and could also defend him in crucial moments, whereas the True Phoenix Tattoo could increase his speed. In the past battles, they had clearly provided a great deal of help to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first level of the Dragon-Phoenix Sutra was ‘Revival of True Spirits’, the birth of the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second level would be ‘Forming’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the name implied, when reaching this level, the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos would be able to break through the shackles of Mu Chen’s body and wholly change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was undoubtedly the first fundamental change!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, then the might of the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos could be gradually unveiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Mu Chen was yearning for this, but cultivating the Dragon-Phoenix Sutra was too difficult. Even if he had spent all his energy on it, he still couldn’t come in contact with the second level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because this cultivation method required a large amount of Divine Beast Blood Essence. It was extremely hard to obtain that much in the Great Thousand World. But in the Divine Beast Origin, there were a large number of Divine Beasts that died in that ground, even super Divine Beasts weren’t excluded. If Mu Chen was lucky enough to obtain them, then it might be possible for him to reach the second level of the Dragon-Phoenix Sutra.</span></p>

Although it’s a little rushed, I should be able to obtain it. It’s just that we will have to pay a slight price.” Mandala nodded her head.</span></p>

Luckily he had the support of the Great Havenlaw Domain. Otherwise, he would already be under heavy pressure if he had to rely on himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Within two months, it looks like I’ll have to start absorbing the Spiritual Divine Liquid as well. Otherwise, if anything happens when I bring you to the Nine Netherbird Clan…” Mandala faintly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen seemed to be well-prepared, Mandala also had to prepare a backup plan in case Mu Chen failed to obtain the quota. The Nine Netherbird Clan would definitely not let him go then and they would want to keep him under house arrest. At that time, she might even need to fight with the experts of the Nine Netherbird Clan.</span></p>

Although there wasn’t any Heavenly Sovereigns present, they would have nothing to fear as long as Mandala wasn’t a genuine Greater Earth Sovereign.</span></p>

After all, the Nine Netherbird Clan was not something that the peak forces of the Northern Region could be compared to. Compared to them, their Great Havenlaw Domain was too lacking. But even so, Mandala had chosen to support him, just this thought alone made Mu Chen feel grateful and touched in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he understood that giving Mandala the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid was the right choice.</span></p>

All you have to do is to break through to the Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm within two months!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard her words, he lightly nodded his head with a deep self-confidence in the depths of his black pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two months from now, everything would be clear.</span></p>
