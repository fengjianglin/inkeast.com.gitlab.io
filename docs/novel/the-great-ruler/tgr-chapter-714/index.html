Perhaps, initially, no one thought that the Nine Nether Troop, who had the disadvantage in regards to quantity, would defeat the famous Blood Hawk Troop…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before it even caused any great ripples in the Great Havenlaw Domain, the news was blown away by another great matter, attracting all the attention of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Great Havenlaw Domain’s Expedition War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Havenlaw Domain was one of the few peak forces in the Northern Region. However, that didn’t imply that no force would dare to provoke them. And the Hundred Battles Domain that was like a ferocious tiger residing in the northwest of the Great Havenlaw Domain was one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hundred Battles Domain wasn’t the name of a force, it was a region name. In that region, there were three powerful forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Myriad Swords Valley, Demonic Corpse Sect, as well as Great Compassion Sky.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those three forces were the big players in the Hundred Battles Domain. Although their whole strength could not be compared to a peak force like the Great Havenlaw Domain, they were still of top quality. And when they united together, even the Great Havenlaw domain would have to fear them a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, the various forces in the Hundred Battles Domain were headed by the three forces. Because of the territories being connected together, the Hundred Battles Domain had been endlessly nibbling away territories from the Great Havenlaw Domain. Although the Great Havenlaw Domain would fight back, the Great Havenlaw Domain had also exercised restraints due to that mysterious Domain Ruler of theirs that had continuously been in seclusion. So, in recent years, the Hundred Battles Domain had been getting more and more arrogant and they vaguely did not place the Great Havenlaw Domain in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts in the Great Havenlaw Domain felt indignation and resentment in their hearts due to this, but there was nothing they could do. If an all-out war were to occur, it would have to come from the mouth of their mysterious Domain Ruler. Otherwise, not even the three Emperors would dare to declare war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because it represented a significant war.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Domain Ruler!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the daily matters in the Great Havenlaw Domain were managed by the three Emperors, everyone understood that the moral pillar in the Great Havenlaw Domain was the Domain Ruler of the Greatlaw Sky. As long as he still existed here, the Great Havenlaw Domain would have the qualification to be known as a peak force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a massive hall that sat on the summit of the Greatlaw Sky. Currently, in the hall, almost all the higher hierarchy of the Great Havenlaw Domain were present and gathered here. The entire hall was in silence as a formless pressure made the countless well-respected people in the Great Havenlaw Domain not daring to utter a single sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had also followed Nine Nether as he stood in the hall. His gaze was directed at the front of the hall. At the most front, the three Emperors stood with their hands behind them. Hooking from their appearance, there wasn’t any of the prestige that they usually had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the highest place of the hall, was a throne forged with golden stone that radiated with a golden lustre. The lustre wasn’t dazzling, but no one dared to directly look at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen cast a glance at the golden throne as curiosity rose in his heart. He wished to know the face of the mysterious Domain Ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Mu Chen was feeling curious in his heart, a bright light abruptly burst out from the throne as space suddenly distorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A formless pressure that was like a hurricane swept out in this hall, causing everyone to involuntarily bow down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the front of the hall, the three Emperors’ respectful voices resounded, “Your subordinate greets the Commander!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greets the Commander!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A respectful voice resounded in order in the hall, even the Blood Hawk King, who was usually arrogant, was humbly bowing without the slightest arrogance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had also lowered his head as well as his gaze drifted up from the corner of his eyes. Not knowing when a golden figure had appeared on the golden throne, that figure seemed to have been cloaked in a golden cape as a golden lustre spread out. No one could saw what was inside it, which made Mu Chen unable to stop feeling disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That light figure quietly sat on the throne as the pressure became something that not even space could endure. It was even distorting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm.” He seemed to be gently nodding his head as a hoarse voice slowly resounded, “All of you are well aware of this matter. Our Great Havenlaw Domain will declare the Expedition War next, and our objective is the Hundred Battles Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he spoke, the gazes of every single higher hierarchy of the Great Havenlaw Domain had their spirits lifted. Were they finally going to take action against the Hundred Battles Domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I will not act out casually in this Expedition War. Because behind the Hundred Battles Domain, should be the shadow of the Sky Profound Palace. Otherwise, even if those mediocre fellows had a thousand guts, they would not dare to provoke the Great Havenlaw Domain.” However, the next speech of the Commander made everyone startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder the Hundred Battles Domain was getting more arrogant in the recent years, so they had the support of the Sky Profound Palace.” The Sky Vulture Emperor frowned his brows as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sky Profound Palace?” Mu Chen’s brows gently twitched. Back in the Merchant continent, the fellow that he seized the Void Great Solar Fruit and Nine Dragons and Elephants Art seemed to be the Young Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So if I am to act in this Expedition War, it would inevitably lure out Liu Tiandao. At that time, I’m afraid that it would be a war with the Sky Profound Palace instead.” The Domain Ruler said faintly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Emperors lightly nodded their heads. Liu Tiandao was also a well-known super expert. If he was forced to act, the commotion caused at that time would undoubtedly be huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, Commander. There’s no need for you to act in dealing with the Hundred Battles Domain.” The Spiritual Pupils Emperor gently smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s hope so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Domain Ruler gently nodded his head as he swept his gaze that was emitting a bright lustre swept throughout the entire hall. Anyone that was looked at by him bowed their bodies even more humbly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood behind Nine Nether as he sensed the unfathomable gaze that seemed to be looking at him intentionally or otherwise. That penetrating sensation made a chill rise in his heart as he immediately lowered his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In this Expedition War, the territories will go to those that establish it, and I will also give another reward.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he said those words, it instantly caused an uproar as many experts in the hall had their eyes blazing with flames. In the past, the majority of the harvest in all the established territories would be handed over to the Great Havenlaw Domain. But this time, the Great Havenlaw Domain had actually left the distribution to them. Just how big of a cake was it?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is the Dragon-Phoenix Haven?” Mu Chen transmitted his voice over the Nine Nether in doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is an exotic place in the Northern Region. It’s said that in the primordial times, there was a stunning battle between the powerful existences of the Dragon and Phoenix clans. In the end, both parties fell, and their blood irrigated the space. In addition to the catalysis of time, a bizarre energy was born. Those that enter it have a chance of obtaining the baptism of either the Divine Dragon or Divine Phoenix, being indestructible.” Nine Nether said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is naturally exaggerated. After all, not even the dragon or phoenix clans could achieve that. It should mean that the baptism of the dragon or phoenix can obtain the vitality similar to that of the Dragon or Phoenix clans, which is greatly beneficial in cultivation.” Nine Nether smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was speechless. The vitality of the Dragon and Phoenix clans were extremely horrifying in the world. Compared to humans, it was much more powerful. If a human could obtain that kind of vitality, it would mean an unkillable humanoid Divine Beast…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, the conditions for opening the Dragon-Phoenix Haven is harsh. It requires several Earth Sovereigns to unite together. Therefore, it became an unwritten rule that only the outstanding younger generations can enter. Furthermore, it will also be a tough contest at that time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen suddenly nodded his head. It was no wonder why Xu Qing and the rest had such expressions on their faces. So the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was that mystical. Furthermore, entering the Dragon-Phoenix Haven would also mean that they were the most outstanding amongst the younger generations of the entire Northern Region. That honour was a sufficient reason for others to fight for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and Nine Nether were conversing, the Domain Ruler on the throne suddenly said, “There was a battle between the Blood Hawk Troop and Nine Nether Troop earlier in the Military Battlefield, right? Who won?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hall went into silence for a moment as everyone directed their gazes onto Mu Chen, who was a little stunned, and Wu Tian, whose face was unsightly. They also felt a little unexpected as the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain would actually pay attention to such a small matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Hawk King’s face was a little awkward as this topic became a wound in his heart. Now that it was ripped apart by the Domain Ruler, he didn’t dare to have any anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Commander, the Nine Nether Troop won.” The Sky Vulture Emperor lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure that was shrouded in dazzling light seemed to have smiled. “The Nine Nether King’s return this time has brought us a Freshman with pretty good potential.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that there was a bet as well. Blood Hawk King, now that you have lost, then acknowledge your loss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the Domain Ruler’s words, the Blood Hawk King hurriedly agreed as the corner of his lips slightly twitched. Since the Domain Ruler had spoken, he wouldn’t dare to act shamelessly on this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Domain Ruler nodded his head and no longer spoke. With a wave of his hand, a light spread out as his figure disappeared. The pressure that had enveloped the hall had also vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt a heavy relief as the pressure of an Earth Sovereign was truly a little fearsome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they felt relieved, their gazes were curiously directed at the youth standing behind Nine Nether. Obtaining the evaluation of ‘pretty good potential’ from the Commander, there would probably be no one in the Great Havenlaw Domain that dared to provoke him in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the front of the hall, the Sleeping Emperor was a little astonished as he glanced at Mu Chen. He had followed the Domain Ruler the longest, and it was the first time that the Domain Ruler would have such a view of a puny Commander…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This young man is interesting…”</span></p>
