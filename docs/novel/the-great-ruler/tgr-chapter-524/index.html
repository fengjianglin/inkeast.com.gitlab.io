Shortly after, he raised his fingers that was drenched in blood and lightly wiped. “A hero saving the beauty? How cliché…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only after the hero saves the beauty and defeats the villain, can it be finished.” Mu Chen smiled in reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just you?” Qin Feng mocked. He clenched his fist as boundless Spiritual Energy became like gale as it whistled around him. If he was outside this region, perhaps his strength would not be considered very powerful. However, inside this region, where Spiritual Energy was sealed, it was heavens-defying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stared at the majestic Spiritual Energy that surged around Qin Feng’s surroundings. His eyes lightly narrowed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder Qin Feng dared to come obstruct them all by himself, so he had such a trump card…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must have used some methods to negate the disruption of this Sealing Spiritual Array, right?” Mu Chen slowly said as he continued, “However, your methods would not negate it entirely. Therefore, a majority of your Spiritual Energy is sealed as well, unabling you to unleash your true strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your eyesight is pretty good.” Qin Feng smiled as he nodded, “However, with just this amount of Spiritual Energy, it is sufficient to deal with you three.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen faintly smiled as a smear of a chill flashed across his pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that you don’t believe…”</span></p>

Shortly after, the Spiritual Energy ripples around him became even more rampant, as if there was wind howling along them. His feet stomped forth as the rampant gale swept forward. His figure had appeared behind Mu Chen, as if he was a ghost. The hurricane fingers flickered with sharp luster as it shot forth towards Mu Chen’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Siiilak!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deep clashing sound resonated as a powerful gale swept out, tearing cracks on the ground. Mu Chen’s figure trembled as he was forced dozen of steps back. At the same time, Qin Feng also took several steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder you are so confident, so you possessed such a powerful physical body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Feng was a little startled as he looked at Mu Chen. Fron their earlier clash, Mu Chen actually used his powerful physique to withstand his attack. Even when Wen Qingxuan was using her warspear, she was in a disadvantage when she fought with him. Clearly, Mu Chen’s physical body had been strengthened to a certain extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qin Feng had also cultivated in the ways of physique, he knew that he was inferior compared to Mu Chen in that aspect. However, it's a pity as even a Body Refining Deity Tier Spiritual Art required the support of Spiritual Energy to use. Right now, Mu Chen could not use the full strength of his refined body and could only rely on the pure strength of his physical body to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A pretty decent target… Let me have some fun before you die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sinister light flashed across Qin Feng’s eyes as the smile on his lips also became savage. With Mu Chen unable to use Spiritual Energy, not only would his strength fall, even his agility would likewise fall. Therefore, the instant Qin Feng used any agility-based techniques, Mu Chen would not be able to touch him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, wasn’t Mu Chen a meat target that had no ways to dodge in his eyes?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhhuuu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Feng smiled as his feet tapped on the ground. A hurricane was formed beneath his feet as he turned into a streak of light as he rotated around Mu Chen at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ommmmn! Ommn!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if Qin Feng had turned into a tornado as he twisted around Mu Chen. The hurricane caused cracks and marks to be left on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s body did not move as he looked at the surrounding hurricane. Vaguely, he could sense Qin Feng’s location. However, he understood the fact that he could not catch up to Qin Feng in his current state. Which implied that the latter could attack him anytime he wished and he had no way of retaliating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhhuuuu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A whirlwind along with sharp Spiritual Energy shot out from the tornado as he flashed across Mu Chen’s back. Instantly, Mu Chen’s clothes were torn apart, leaving behind a trace of fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s expression did not change. However, the muscles twitched, implying the intense pain that was brought to him by the wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the tornado, Qin Feng’s laughter thundered as it contained mockery and complacency in his tone. His opponent that he felt was thorny earlier on was like a catfish that was laid on the chopping board, allowing him to slaughter as he wished. The sensation was simply too marvelous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhuuuu! Shhhhhhhuu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, Qin Feng unleashed his ruthless attacks as Spiritual Energy swept past one after another, cutting Mu Chen’s body up. However, he seemed to be enjoying the joy that it brought him as he did not attack any of Mu Chen’s fatal points. As the wind swept past, Mu Chen was covered in wounds as fresh blood dripped. However, he did not suffer any fatal injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen appeared to be in a very miserable state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite so, Mu Chen still did not moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too far away, Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan had gathered together. When the two of them attacked, no one in the surroundings could get close to the two of them. When they heard the peculiar movements, they directed their charming eyes over to the direction of the commotion, causing their faces to change the instant the scene caught their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the tornado, Mu Chen did not make any movements as blood flowed down from his body, making him appear in a miserable state.</span></p>

She suddenly tightened her grip on her longspear as she made peculiar seals. Her tone was frost cold, “I’ll go and kill him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li suddenly grabbed onto Wen Qingxuan’s hand as she obstructed her from doing so as she shook her head towards the latter, “Leave it to him.”</span></p>

We have miscalculated, not only did they have the advantage in numbers, Qin Feng could even use Spiritual Energy in this region!” Wen Qingxuan said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qin Feng still is not qualified to defeat him, even if he does not have any Spiritual Energy.” Luo Li said slowly and within her gentle tone, it was filled with confidence for Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she felt throbbing pain in her heart at the sight of Mu Chen’s current state and was itching to slaughter Qin Feng, Mu Chen was a prideful person that did not like others barging into his matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Luo Li’s confidence for Mu Chen, Wen Qingxuan was slightly startled. Shortly after, she saw that the slender figure that was covered in fresh blood still stood towering like a spear. He seemed like a mountain that would not fall. She bit on her lips as she turned her head away.</span></p>
