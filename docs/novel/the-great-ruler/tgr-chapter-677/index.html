 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden Sovereign Celestial Body that was a thousand feet tall stood towering between the heavens and earth as golden light spread out. The Spiritual Energy in this region was a little violent at this moment as the Spiritual Energies gathered around the Sovereign Celestial Body. The scene of it was extraordinarily majestic and spectacular.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether stood in the sky as she looked at the Sovereign Celestial Body. Her gaze was filled with dense shock. Although she had the physique of a Divine Beast and could not cultivate a Sovereign Celestial Body, she was someone that had tons of experience. She had even seen many of the 99 Rankings of Sovereign Celestial Bodies. However, she couldn’t help being a little shocked at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She realised that amongst the majority of the Sovereign Celestial Bodies that she had seen before, there wasn’t one that had a might compared to this one before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether looked around. Fortunately, the surroundings had already been isolated by her. Otherwise, many people would sense the commotion, revealing some of Mu Chen’s means.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the power of a Sovereign Celestial Body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sovereign Celestial Body that seemed like it was forged from gold opened its golden eyes that were filled with endless prestige. The Sovereign Celestial Body slowly clenched its fists, causing even space to distort a little. Formless and horrifying energy fluctuated in his limbs, giving him an urge to roar at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy of this region whistled over, forming into light rays and was absorbed by the Sovereign Celestial Body. At this instance, as the Sovereign Celestial Body breathed in and out, there was a mist shrouding it, filled with Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Mu Chen realised the power of Sovereign Celestial Bodies. It was a mountainous power. If he didn’t have the trump card as a Spiritual Array Master when he fought with Liu Ming, it would definitely be a tough matter for him to defeat the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body that Liu Ming had cultivated was very powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen had strong confidence right now that he could directly blow the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he didn’t know what rank the Great Solar Undying Body was equivalent to, it was definitely several times more powerful than the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden Sovereign Celestial Body emitted a faint buzzing noise, and as the golden light surged, the massive figure started to rapidly shrink. In just a few breath’s time, a slender</span><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">silhouette stood in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was naturally Mu Chen that had appeared. He lowered his head and looked at both of his arms. His face was filled with unconcealable joy. Evidently, the power of the Great Solar Undying Body had left him satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these years of yearning had not left him disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After refining the Great Solar Undying Body successfully, he had finally become a genuine First Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he had some expectation of the competition of the Greatlaw Goldpond. He wished to use the power of the Greatlaw Goldpond to make his Great Solar Undying Body even more perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Great Solar Undying Body disappeared, there were several gazes from the depths of the Greatlaw Sky that abruptly shifted towards the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such ripples… what is Nine Nether that lass doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the several gazes, one of them was naturally Sky Vulture Emperor of the three Emperors. He was looking at the direction of the Nine Nether Palace with slight shock. Although Nine Nether had swiftly formed a Spiritual Energy screen to isolate Mu Chen’s Sovereign Celestial Body, an expert of Sky Vulture Emperor’s level could still vaguely sense it. Although he wasn’t too sure in such a short amount of time, he could detect the sudden violent, abnormal fluctuations of Spiritual Energies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another gaze belonged to the Spiritual Pupils Emperor. Both of his eyes were narrowed. There were faint fluctuations on the space before his eyes. His gaze seemed like it had pierced through space and was directly at the Nine Nether Palace. However, since Mu Chen had already recovered at this moment, there was only the golden light that still had yet to dissipate, revealing the abnormal Spiritual Energy ripples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Pupils Emperor retracted his gaze with a calm expression as he slowly shut his eyes. With his mystical eyes, he found out that the abnormal fluctuations from earlier should be caused by that youth called Mu Chen. However, he did not pay too much attention as a youth that had just stepped into the Sovereign Realm was still insufficient to make him attach him with importance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they retracted their gazes, the drowsy man had abruptly opened his eyes in the depths of a pavilion. His face, which had always been lazy, revealed a smear of a shock for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a powerful Sovereign Celestial Body…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He softly muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Congratulations, you have finally achieved what you have wished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she had managed to create the Spiritual Energy screen in time, Nine Nether didn’t know if the three peak experts of the Great Havenlaw domain had noticed the commotion at this location. Her figure moved as she appeared before Mu Chen, her gaze filled with smiles. She naturally knew how long Mu Chen had prepared just for this day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen laughed, “What rank do you think this Great Solar Undying Body of mine belongs to in the 99 Rankings of Sovereign Celestial Bodies?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Nine Nether briefly pondered, before she said, “Hard to say, I have yet to experience the power of it. Furthermore, many powerful Sovereign Celestial Bodies possess special abilities. But, based on the power from earlier, this Great Solar Undying Body could rank at least in the fifties.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only in the fifties?” Mu Chen was a little unsatisfied with the estimation. No matter what, the Great Solar Undying Body was one of the crucial prerequisites to the Primordial Immortal Body, which was ranked 4 on the 99 Rankings of Sovereign Celestial Bodies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be unsatisfied, a Sovereign Celestial Body that is ranked in the fifties is an absolute treasure for a force like the Great Havenlaw Domain. Not to mention an ordinary person, even Sovereign experts that have reached Seventh and Eighth Grade Sovereign would have their hearts moved by it and be willing to become an Elder just to cultivate it.” Nine Nether rolled her eyes at Mu Chen.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did this fellow think that a Sovereign Celestial Body that is ranked in the fifties is something he could get on the streets?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rubbed his nose, since it did make sense after putting some thought into it. Even the Young Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace, Liu Ming, could only cultivate the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body that was the 97th rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he could sense that there seemed to be many profundities in this Great Solar Undying Body. Right now, he had just successfully cultivated it, so he couldn’t fully execute all of its powers. Otherwise, Nine Nether would definitely not rank it amongst the fifties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether waved her hand, dissipating the Spiritual Energy screen. Two streaks of light flew over from the distance and appeared before them, it was Tang Bing and Tang Rou. The glances that those two gave to look at Mu Chen had slight astonishment in them. Compared to a month ago, the current Spiritual Energy that was being emitted from Mu Chen’s body was much more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you have succeeded your refinery of the Sovereign Celestial Body?” Tang Bing exclaimed in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head with a smile as he looked at Tang Bing with some shock as well. “You have broken through?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to a month ago, the Spiritual Energy fluctuations around Tang Bing was much more powerful. Evidently, she had achieved a breakthrough in this one month’s time and stepped into the Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to thank you for those drops of Spiritual Sovereign Liquid.” Tang Bing was also pretty happy about her breakthrough to the Sovereign Realm. Tang Bing, who usually had a cold expression on, revealed a charming smile at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he flicked his finger. A streak of light flew over to Tang Bing. The latter hastily received it. There was a scarlet scroll within the ray of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the cultivation technique for the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body, I believe it will be useful for you.” Mu Chen smiled. When he seized the Mustard Seed Bracelet from Liu Ming, he had found the cultivation method for the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body within. Although the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body wasn’t something that he would have his eyes on, it was, after all, a ranked Sovereign Celestial Body that could cause ordinary Sovereign experts to be tempted. Thus, it was a fitting gift for Tang Bing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that it was actually the 97th rank of the 99 Rankings of Sovereign Celestial Bodies, Tang Bing was stunned, before she shook her head shortly after. “This gift is too expensive. I cannot accept this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, not just anyone could obtain the opportunity to cultivate the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body. Originally, Tang Bing had intended to refine an ordinary Sovereign Celestial Body for now and change to a more powerful one when she grew stronger in the future. However, she never expected for Mu Chen to gift her a ranked Sovereign Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Mu Chen, are you trying to woo my big sister? You’re truly willing to part with things. First the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid and now the Sovereign Celestial Body.” Tang Rou smiled from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn lass! I will tear your mouth apart!” Tang Bing’s face flushed red as she gritted her teeth and pretended to be angry. Tang Rou chuckled as she hid behind Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Tang Bing didn’t know how to act after being messed around with by Tang Rou. She held onto the scarlet scroll and didn’t know if she was to accept or return it. At this instance, she could only stomp her feet with hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, enough.” Nine Nether chuckled as she held onto Tang Bing’s slim waist and laughed. “You should accept it first. Right now, you really are in need of a suitable Sovereign Celestial Body for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Nine Nether’s words, Tang Bing nodded her head, before she said to Mu Chen, “Thank you, I will definitely return this favour.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was about to wave his hand, he saw how serious the expression of the girl before him was. This girl naturally had her own principles. Thus, he could only smile and nod his head.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister is talking about the Nine Nether Troop?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing saw Nine Nether nodding her head, before giving a smile. “Rest assured, I have not loosened up for all these years when Big Sister left. Our Nine Nether Troop is even more powerful compared to when you left.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether nodded her head with gratification. “Right now, Mu Chen is the Commander of our Nine Nether Palace. According to the rules, he will have to lead the Nine Nether Troop, what do you all think about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Troop was, after all, managed by Tang Bing for all these years.

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She suddenly paused her words and chuckled while looking at Mu Chen. “But there are many experts among the Nine Nether Troop with some untamable horses. I’m just afraid that Mu Chen can’t tame them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, he was about to reject this matter to prevent Tang Bing from being unsatisfied with him putting a hand in her affairs. But when Mu Chen heard her words, his brows lightly lifted and there was some interest in his voice.</span></p>
