The sky here was eternally in darkness with terrifying Spiritual Energy storms dominating the horizon. In the depths of the storms, mountains were levelled to the ground. Only the black-coloured mountains could bear the sweeping Spiritual Energy storms. That’s because they were forged with Grimsteel. Their sturdiness was something that not even an all-out attack from an Eighth Grade Sovereign could shatter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the ground, there was a myriad-foot-wide abyss that looked like a large black dragon lying on the ground with chills coming from that pitch-black abyss.</span></p>

Vaguely, shadows could be seen hovering about. Those were the spirits of experts that had fallen here. Except, they had lost their own consciousness and became similar to ghosts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the fact that those things had absorbed the unique energy in the Fallen Battlefield, they had maintained a portion of their strength when they were alive. Furthermore, they were filled with offensive characteristics and anyone approaching them would be attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This region was like a death region without any traces of vitality.</span></p>

Seeing the darkened sky, there was a myriad-foot-sized streak of light that flew across with a huge amount of people in that light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This party was naturally the one that was received by the Sky Vulture Emperor, the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party that came into the depths of the Fallen Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were received by the Sky Vulture Emperor, they were extremely cautious. They were so much so that they did not even dare to fly in the sky and had flown at a low altitude.</span></p>

There were some routes that were further, but it was these routes that allowed them to avoid the violent areas in this region.</span></p>

If one was caught up in them, then the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party would probably perish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these sorts of natural disasters, not even the Sky Vulture Emperor could protect himself.</span></p>

But fortunately, they were all within the expectations of the Sky Vulture Emperor. When they were caught up in some unavoidable Spiritual Energy storms, the Sky Vulture Emperor would lead the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party to hide into those massive black mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humm! Humm!</span></p>

A dark-grey Spiritual Energy storm dominated over the horizon, causing even space to distort by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, Nine Nether and the Kings all had a solemn expression as they looked at the storm outside and were inwardly startled. That’s because they could sense how terrifying the storm was. If they were to be pulled into it, they would definitely not be able to escape death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fortunately, when the Domain Lords and the rest found the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury, they managed to find a safe route. Otherwise, we would have perished by now if we had recklessly barged in here.” Nine Nether sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They finally got here after numerous bitter battles in the Fallen Battlefield. But right now, if they were careless, then all the efforts that they had previously given would have been in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gently nodded his head. The depths of the Fallen Battlefield was indeed extremely dangerous. It was no wonder why even the Sky Vulture Emperor would be so cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at the greyed outside world with his eyes narrowed. Perhaps because of his will gradually getting stronger, his perception was extremely keen and he could sense that there were many profound undulations in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The region was filled with so much danger that even Mu Chen did not dare to probe any deeper, fearing that a disaster might befall him if he did. At this place, if he was careless, then he might probably not be able to come out alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the ancient times, when the Fiends invaded the Great Thousand World, this place was a massive battlefield. From the information written on some ancient texts, the amount of Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses of the Great Thousand World that fell here had exceeded the numbers of fingers on both hands. This is still excluding the amount of Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses of the Fiend Clan that perished here.” Behind them, the Sky Vulture Emperor faintly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and the rest were speechless as they heard that. This amount of Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses had even exceeded the number of Earth Sovereigns in the Northern Region. Thus, one could infer how terrifying of a scale the tribulation that was brought to the Great Thousand World was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Sky Vulture Emperor, how much longer will it take for us to reach the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury?” The Asura King looked at the Sky Vulture Emperor and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to this speed, it should take two more days for us to reach it.” The Sky Vulture Emperor said. If he was alone, then he would naturally be faster. But he had to bring such a huge army along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, along the way here, if any of you sense any abnormal spatial fluctuations, do not touch them. There are too many experts that have perished here, and when these experts perished, they would hide their bodies in the spatial cracks. Although their consciousness has dissipated, they are still able to preserve their bodies due to the unique energy in the Fallen Battlefield, and possess a portion of their strength as well. If you guys awaken them, then they would frantically launch attacks at us.” The Sky Vulture Emperor reminded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Previously, when the Spiritual Pupils Emperor and I had searched around, we woke up a death spirit. Even though the two of us joined forces together, all we managed to do was forcefully make it retreat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone heard that, their hearts trembled. Even the Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor could only protect themselves when they joined hands. Thus, the strength of the death spirits when they were alive was at least around the Ninth Grade Sovereign Realm. There might even be some that were half a step into the Earth Sovereign Realm. The depths of the Fallen Battlefield truly contained dangers at every step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The army rested in the mountain till the storm disappeared before continuing their journey. In the upcoming journey, there were still many obstructions. If they did not have the lead of the Sky Vulture Emperor, then Mu Chen spectaculated that even if some of their armies could survive, it wouldn’t exceed the number of fingers on one hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although their journey was slow and challenging, it was still one without any dangers. When the second day came to an end, the army had finally passed through numerous mountains that were toweringly reaching into the clouds. Thereafter, they were heavily shocked by this scene before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After those black mountains, the violent storm had suddenly disappeared. Even the Spiritual Energy had become abnormally calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Mu Chen and the rest shocked wasn’t how silent this place was, but up ahead of them. It was a shattered scene. The space seemed like like it was torn apart by some terrifying power. Black cracks that had formed a sinister-looking mouth were wriggling between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking through the black cracks, there were spiritual lights surging and, vaguely, Mu Chen could see a massive and bottomless black pyramid in the depths of the shattered space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The size of that black pyramid was indescribable. Compared to it, they were like dust. A sense of shock enveloped over, which made innumerable people feel their scalps going numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This black pyramid is the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury that we have discovered.” The Sky Vulture Emperor somewhat lamented as he looked at the shattered space before him and continued, “This space should’ve been torn apart by a terrifying Spiritual Energy undulation from the ancient times. According to our estimations, there must’ve been a Greater Earth Sovereign that perished here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greater Earth Sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and the rest all sucked in a cold breath. Their Domain Ruler, which was Mandala, was only a Lesser Earth Sovereign. Compared to a Greater Earth Sovereign, she lacked a complete grade. Naturally, there weren’t any existences of such a level in the Northern Region. Otherwise, the situation in the Northern Region wouldn’t be as balanced, since a Greater Earth Sovereign could completely change the situation in the Northern Region.</span></p>

Three silhouettes came out of the distorted space, and the first was a petite silhouette, the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain, Mandala. Behind her was the Sleeping Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor.</span></p>

Mu Chen had not only managed to become a Battle Formation Master. Accurately speaking, the Battle Formation Master of the Netherworld Palace has also died in his hands, and in this Hunting War, Mu Chen’s contributions cannot go unnoticed.” The Sky Vulture Emperor smiled from the side as he mentioned Mu Chen’s contributions in this Hunting War.</span></p>

Clearly, she was extremely gratified and satisfied by Mu Chen’s performance.</span></p>
