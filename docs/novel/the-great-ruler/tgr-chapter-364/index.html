 <p><strong>Chapter 364 - Searching for Fire</strong></p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s figure shot through the spiritual mist. He was able to sense intense Spiritual Energy radiating from a far distance behind him. Obviously, Luo Li had already truly started crossing hands with Wu Jia.</p>
 <p>Retracting his gaze, Mu Chen proceeded to coldly stare at Mao Jiang, who he had captive in his hands. With a sneer, he said, “Looks like you didn’t tell me some things, huh?”</p>
 <p>Mao Jiang’s expression faintly changed as he repeatedly shook his head.</p>
 <p>“How did that Wu Jia know which direction we were at?” asked Mu Chen chillingly. “Was it you that informed him?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Mu Chen’s question, Mao Jiang hastily replied, “There’s Spiritual Arrays arranged by Wu Jia within the spiritual mist in the depths of the Western Desolate Territory. Therefore, he’s able to sense all of the fluctuations within it.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen shot a cold glare at Mao Jiang, before shooting a ray of Spiritual Energy out from his finger. Shooting into the spiritual mist, he spread his senses out. Indeed, Mu Chen was able to sense some extremely faint and strange fluctuations radiating from within. Those were the sensory threads from those Spiritual Arrays.</p>
 <p>This Wu Jia truly had some ability.</p>
 <p>A faint flash appeared in Mu Chen’s eyes. In the next instant, with a wave of his sleeve, dozen’s of Spiritual Seals condensed, before dissipating around his body. Glowing threads interweaved around his body, seemingly forming a small-sized Spiritual Array, enveloping him within.</p>
 <p>This Spiritual Array wasn’t large. However, it possessed the capability to isolate one’s sensory abilities. Mu Chen didn’t want every move and every action he made to be collected in Wu Jia’s hands.</p>
 <p>After arranging the array, Mu Chen turned his apathetic gaze towards Mao Jiang, before saying in a indifferent voice, “Continue leading the way.”</p>
 <p>A shiver went through Mao Jiang’s heart due to the gaze coming from Mu Chen, causing him to immediately continue guiding the way.</p>
 <p>In the continuing journey, Mu Chen didn’t receive any more obstructions. After throwing off Wu Jia’s means of perception, that fellow shouldn’t be able to sense his position anymore.</p>
 <p>This continued for dozens of minutes, before Mu Chen’s speed was slowly reduced. A gigantic mountain cave appeared in front of him. At the end of the mountain cave was a deep valley pervaded by spiritual mist.</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong should be inside of that deep valley. However, the spiritual mist present there is too dense, making it extremely difficult to search for them,” said Mao Jiang as he point towards the deep valley.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen faintly nodded his head. Flicking his finger, a ray of Spiritual Energy shot out, before violently knock Mao Jiang unconscious. Hoisting him up, Mu Chen proceeded to shoot forward, rushing into the deep valley.</p>
 <p>Upon entering the deep valley, Mu Chen’s vision received even more impedance. After pondering deeply awhile, Mu Chen shot towards the air as Spiritual Energy erupted from his body. Spiritual Energy burning with black flames rose to the sky akin to a smoke signal, causing much of the surrounding spiritual mist to dissipate.</p>
 <p>The terrain within the deep valley was complicated. Coupled with the obstruction of the spiritual mist, it was too difficult to search for the two that were hidden within. Therefore, Mu Chen chose to directly release his Spiritual Energy. His Spiritual Energy fluctuations should be very familiar to Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong. If the two were to sense it, they would definitely give a signal in response.</p>
 <p>This action by Mu Chen had achieved quite a good result. As his Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiated out, within a short span of less than a minute, a ray of Spiritual Energy erupted from a place within the deep valley.</p>
 <p>This Spiritual Energy fluctuation was rather familiar, it’s actually Shen Cangsheng’s.</p>
 <p>Slight happiness erupted within Mu Chen’s heart, before shoot straight at the origin of the fluctuations. After a dozen breaths, his speed slowed down as his gaze faintly concentrated in his forward direction. Within the cliff present in his sight was a mountain cave. Present outside of the mountain cave was a figure standing tall and upright.</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng.”</p>
 <p>Upon spotting that familiar figure, Mu Chen instantly breathed a sigh of relief, as if a heavy burden had been lifted from him. As he moved closer and noticed Shen Cangsheng’s appearance, he could not help feeling shock and astonishment.</p>
 <p>At this moment, black blotches covered Shen Cangsheng’s skin. These black blotches seemed to be squirming, while a sinister and poisonous aura radiated from them, causing Shen Cangsheng to appear exceedingly pallid and haggard. However, even though his condition was extremely miserable and poor, a smile was still present on Shen Cangsheng’s face and the disdainful aura not reduced the slightest bit.</p>
 <p>“Hey. Never expected that you’d be the first to arrive here. You truly surprised me.” Looking at Mu Chen, Shen Cangsheng couldn’t help smiling as he spoke out.</p>
 <p>Landing at the entrance of the cave, Mu chen casually tossed Chi Yu and Mao Jiang, whom he was holding in his hands, towards the ground.</p>
 <p>“That’s Chi Yu and Mao Jiang? You’ve actually dealt with them.” Seeing the two people, Shen Cangsheng felt slightly surprised. Although Chi Yu and Mao Jiang were ranked 7th and 8th, they were, after all, at the Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Stage, and could be considered formidable. He never expected that they would fall into Mu Chen’s hands.</p>
 <p>“Senior Brother Lin Zheng and the rest had also rushed over here. However, the current situation doesn’t seem especially good.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked at Shen Cangsheng and asked, “How are the two of you?”</p>
 <p>“Look’s like the situation isn’t too good,” replied Shen Cangsheng as he helpless shrugged his shoulders, before walking into the cave. As Mu Chen walked in, he noticed Li Xuantong, who was in a worse condition that Shen Cangsheng. The former’s black blotches were denser than the latter’s, while his entire body was permeated by those sinister and poisonous fluctuations.</p>
 <p>As Li Xuantong raised his eyes, Mu Chen could also see a black blotch on his face. This made the former’s handsome-looking face appear somewhat strange. Noticing Mu Chen, he revealed a bitter smile at the corner of his mouth. Obviously, he also didn’t expect that the first person to find them would actually be the latter.</p>
 <p>“What’s this all about?” Mu Chen somewhat didn’t understand this whole situation. With Shen Cangsheng’s and Li Xuantong’s strength, even if there were more enemies, they shouldn’t have ended up in such a miserable state.</p>
 <p>“Mo Longzi had long prepared for us. His strength had already reached Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase. He had always kept this hidden in our previous exchanges. Only at the end, when we were encircled by them, did that fellow expose his strength. Furthermore, he had brought out the Demonic Dragon Poison from the Demonic Dragon Palace. That’s an extremely toxic poison refined by a Sovereign, and extremely formidable. We’re not afraid of getting poisoned, but it’s just that our strength still can’t be restore,” replied Li Xuantong in a dull manner.</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s eyes contracted. This Mo Longzi had truly reached that level. That meant to say that even Senior Brother Lin Zheng might not be able to match up with him head-on.</p>
 <p>“The cultivation of those in the Demonic Dragon Palace is extremely sinister. Although there’s a limit in their future, one’s early stages would have leaps and bounds in their cultivation. I’ve truly neglected to take this aspect into consideration, since I’ve never imagined that Mo Longzi would break through that quickly,” said Shen Cangsheng with a frown. In reality, he had also come into contact with that phase. If he was able to recover after all of this, he would definitely be able to break through into Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase. However, it was a pity that due to this Demonic Dragon Poison, they were unable to extract themselves from Mo Longzi’s pursuit.</p>
 <p>“The most important thing now is to get rid of this Demonic Dragon Poison. If Mo Longzi truly promoted into Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase, I’m afraid that Senior Brother Lin Zheng and the rest will not be able to hold out for too long. We have to help them as fast as possible,” muttered Mu Chen to himself.</p>
 <p>Sitting on the floor, Shen Cangsheng said in a helpless manner, “This Demonic Dragon Poison can only be forcefully dispelled by a Sovereign Stage expert. We’ve no other way…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen slightly frowned, Sovereign Stage expert? If they could find a Sovereign Stage expert, where would that Mo Longzi dare to bounce around? He had definitely bet that the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy wouldn’t dispatch any Sovereign Stage experts to deal with him. Therefore, he would dare to be that rampant and aggressive.</p>
 <p>“Let me try. My Spiritual Energy is somewhat special. Let’s see if it will have any effect,” muttered Mu Chen. After speaking out, his Spiritual Energy started to fuse with the Nine Netherflame. This fire should have some restrictive effect against a sinister poison like the Demonic Dragon Poison.</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong both nodded their heads. As of now, in such a desperate situation, they could only try anything presented to them.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen arrived before Shen Cangsheng. With a clench of his fist, Spiritual Energy burning with black flames rose from his fist, radiating a high temperature heat wave as it appeared.</p>
 <p>Placing his palm over Shen Cangsheng’s crown, Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy gushed into the former’s body. Not the slightest bit of resistance was put up by the former, letting the latter’s Spiritual Energy enter his body.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy entered Shen Cangsheng’s body, he could feel the messed-up state within the latter’s body. That Demonic Dragon Poison was akin to several dragons, travelling around within his body. As the strands of poison travelled about, the Spiritual Energy along their paths was corroded and even dissipated. From the looks of this, the Spiritual Energy within the bodies of Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong would forever be unable to recover if nothing was done.</p>
 <p>After muttering incomprehensibly to himself, Mu Chen controlled his Spiritual Energy to shoot forward, before wrapping around a strand of Demonic Dragon Poison. Black flames instantly rose as Mu Chen prepared to refine and dispel it.</p>
 <p>Chi. Chi.</p>
 <p>Following the encirclement by the black flames, the Demonic Dragon Poison seemed to have discovered this danger, and it immediately emitted an ear-piercing sound. A black poisonous aura radiated from it, defending it from the black flames.</p>
 <p>As the black flames rose and the poisonous aura extended out, the two started to intertwine. However, what made Mu Chen feel slightly depressed was that this Demonic Dragon Poison was very tenacious and resilient. Even when faced with the refinement of the Nine Netherflame, it would entrench itself until the very last of it dissipates. Although he was definitely able to dissipate it, bit by bit, this speed was too slow, much too slow.</p>
 <p>A sigh shook through Mu Chen’s heart, before withdrawing his Spiritual Energy. At this moment, his face started to turn dark. According to this speed, when he had completely refined and eradicated all of the Demonic Dragon Poison within the bodies of Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, a number of days might have passed.</p>
 <p>However, at this very moment, they clearly didn’t possess that kind of time.</p>
 <p>Upon noticing Mu Chen’s expression, both Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong gave a soft sigh. Although they truly didn’t hold much hope about this, all in all, they felt slightly disappointed.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen started to faintly wrinkle his forehead. Although the Nine Netherflames were able to refine and eradicate the Demonic Dragon Poison, it clearly didn’t possess enough strength. If he had even greater and more powerful flames, he might be able to rapidly deal with the Demonic Dragon Poison.</p>
 <p>However, where would he be able to obtain a flame that was more powerful than the Nine Netherflames?</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen started to sink deep into his thoughts, a quiet and stifling atmosphere started to envelop the mountain cave, causing others to find it harder to breath.</p>
 <p>“An even stronger flame…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen muttered those words to himself. After quite a while, a flash of insight furiously appeared within his head. A flame that’s stronger than the Nine Netherflame?</p>
 <p>After successfully transforming, doesn’t the flames of the Nine Netherbird also evolve? From the Nine Netherflame, to the Undying Flame?</p>
 <p>A flash of brilliance erupted in Mu Chen’s eyes, before faintly narrowing them. In the next moment, his mind started to enter his Universe Bracelet, finding the Nine Netherbird who had transformed into a giant egg after successfully passing through her tribulation.</p>
 <p>Within the Universe bracelet, Mu Chen quickly found the giant egg that was in a mysterious black colour. Faint purplish runic patterns sparkled on its surface, while a strong consciousness radiated from it.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s mind quietly started to call out to the giant egg. He didn’t possess the qualifications to control the Undying Fire. Therefore, he could only hope for Nine Nether, who’s undergoing her transformation to be able to hear his summons, and give a strand of Undying Fire to him…</p>
 <p>“Nine Nether…hurry…”</p>
 <p>As he continued to urge her, Mu Chen muttered to himself within his heart.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen attempted to retrieve some Undying Fire to help refine the Demonic Dragon Poison for Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, something was happening somewhere else within the depths of the Western Desolate Territory.</p>
 <p>The earth here showed signs of collapse, and gigantic fissures extended out from the ground, while all the mountain peaks had shattered and collapsed.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>On a shattered mountain peak, a figure shot down. He sent a fist down to explode the giant rocks that littered the floor, before extending his palm into the deep pit, retrieving a figure drenched in blood.</p>
 <p>Sending an apathetic gaze towards Lin Zheng, who had fainted from his heavy injuries, Mo Longzi carried him over his shoulder, before turning around and walking to another direction.</p>
 <p>“I should deal with the second one now…”</p>
