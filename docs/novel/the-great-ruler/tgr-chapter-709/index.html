Mu Chen’s eyes were tightly shut and were submerged in the ocean of Battle Will, rising up and down within it. However, every single attempt of him trying to integrate into the Battle Will was arduous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If only he could control this Battle Will, but it was hard for him to integrate with it and become one. If he could not achieve it, then the so-called “achieving with the heart” was just empty talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen wasn’t dejected from his failures, since he knew that the Battle Will was a faintly discernible existence. It was born from the will of people and became powerful because it was integrated with Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But because every single Battle Will was different, it wasn’t an easy task to perfectly integrate with all of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen calmed his heart down as the profundities in the damaged bamboo constantly flashed across his mind and carefully tried to comprehend it in an attempt to obtain clues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle Will was something that integrated the will with Spiritual Energy, trying to get ahold of it would require the will in the Battle Will to follow orders. That was the basic requirements for Battle Formation Master. However, it was just that there were a thousand experts in the troop, all of them had been tempered with blood and fire, their will was unyielding. Trying to thoroughly unleash the energy of Battle Will required both parties to achieve trust and harmony without any reservations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But forcefully controlling it with strength was an inferior method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen opened his shut eyes as a smear of pondering flashed across. After a brief moment, he slowly stretched his hand out and the Spiritual Energy that was enveloped around him quietly retracted into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, his will had also started to relax. It was so much so that he had even given up the resistance by instinct and allowed the tremendous Battle Will to violently surge towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Typically, when people control the Battle Will, they more or less had a resistance in their heart. After all, once the surging violence of Battle Will exceeded the limit of the person controlling it, it might counter them and devour their consciousness. Thus, Mu Chen’s actions were undoubtedly very daring in the views of many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surging Battle Will was like storming tidal waves as it poured into Mu Chen’s body. But he did not make any resistance and allowed the Battle Will to rage. As time passed, Mu Chen’s conscious had also started to suffer the corrosion of the surging Battle Will, which was expected. But fortunately, he held onto a trace of consciousness, allowing his consciousness to fall between a state of fuzzy and clear…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t how much time had passed. Mu Chen’s consciousness had also started to slack a little. However, it wasn’t from defeat but was orderly scattering and coming in contact with the will of many experts that was hidden within the surging Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar! Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if there were countless yells of battle ringing out in Mu Chen’s heart. His will continued to try to come in contact with the will of the many experts hidden within the Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen had obtained the acknowledgement of the Nine Nether Troop right now, the acknowledgement only allowed him to control the Battle Will on the surface. But, right now, he was attempting a more profound integration that allowed him to unleash the real power of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then, could he be considered a true Battle Formation Master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time gradually passed, three days had quietly passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these three days, the Nine Nether Troop’s bet with the Blood Hawk Troop had already been spread throughout the Great Havenlaw Domain under the deliberate promotion of some people, so everyone knew about this bet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, they also knew that if the Nine Nether Troop lost, the Nine Nether Palace would submit to the Blood Hawk Hall. This outcome was somewhat astonishing, since there weren’t any King forces that have submitted to another King force in the history of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, it had practically pushed the Nine Nether Palace to a dead end. The moment they lost, their reputation would collapse. At that time, no matter how much the Sky Vulture Emperor supported them, it would be tough for them to remain as one of the Nine Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people were inwardly shaking their heads, believing that the Nine Nether King was still too young after all. Compared to the Blood Hawk King, who was cunning, she was still lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter how boiling the Great Havenlaw Domain had become because of the bet, the Nine Nether Palace remained in silence without any panic. This made many people feel a little startled. Could it be that the Nine Nether Palace wasn’t panicking in the slightest?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were so confident about the Nine Nether Troop?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the suspicions and guesses, the deadline of three days had already come…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the third sun tore through the layers of clouds and shone onto the ground, nearly every gaze in the Great Havenlaw Domain was directed at the silent Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an area of the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Asura King looked at the direction of the Nine Nether Palace without any expression. Standing behind him, the head of the Four Great Domain Lords, Xu Qing, stood with his arms hung down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord, is there still nothing from the Nine Nether Palace?” Xu Qing waited for a brief moment, before he couldn’t help asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Asura King faintly said, “Although the Nine Nether King is young, she is not a reckless person. She must have some confidence to agree to the bet of the Blood Hawk Hall. They must be making some preparations, since the Nine Nether Palace has shut themselves up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s said that this bet was agreed upon by the new Commander, Mu Chen…” Xu Qing frowned his brows and continued, “He must be somewhat unaware of the immensity of the heavens and earth. How can Nine Nether allow him to do as he wishes?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a peculiar fluctuation in his tone as he realised that Nine Nether’s relationship with Mu Chen didn’t seem to be as simple as that of a superior and their subordinate. Otherwise, how would Nine Nether allow him to do such things?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Asura King cast a glance at him as a smear of a smile appeared on his face that did not have any expression. “Why? Jealous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Qing’s handsome face flushed a little as he smiled in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t belittle that young man.” The Asura King shook his head as he narrowed his eyes, looking at the direction of the Nine Nether Palace. “I have a feeling that the Blood Hawk Hall will regret provoking him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Qing was startled and sunk into silence shortly after. This was the first time that he had heard the Asura King give such an evaluation to a young man that was even younger than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk Hall</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Hawk King was seated on his throne, his eerie face was filled with a cheerful smile. He had two metal balls in his hand as he slowly rotated them. His gaze, which was looking at the direction of the Nine Nether Palace, was also filled with ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t matter if there were any movements from the Nine Nether Palace, since there would only be one result. After suppressing the Nine Nether Palace, he would see if anyone dared to offend their Blood Hawk Hall in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, when the Nine Nether Palace loses, he wanted to see what expression would be on the wild and beautiful face of that prideful woman, Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, a smear of a blazing light surged in the Blood Hawk King’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Asura King and Blood Hawk King were looking at the Nine Nether Palace, the various Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain had also directed their gazes over to the Nine Nether Palace. If the Nine Nether Palace still kept their doors shut today, then this bet would be a laughing stock, which was something that the Blood Hawk King wished to see.</span></p>

She wore dark green clothing with tight-fitting trousers, outlining her alluring legs, with her hair fluttering in the wind. Her cool and elegant face was calm.</span></p>

This was because in the sky not too far away, Mu Chen had not made any movements during these three days.</span></p>

Everyone would be saying that their Nine Nether Palace feared to fight, which would be a fatal impact to their reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Nine Nether.” Tang Bing couldn’t help calling out as she continued, “Should we forcefully wake Mu Chen up? Even if we lose, it’s still better than being scared of a battle.”</span></p>

A brief moment later, she stretched her waist and directed her gaze towards the area that was filled with Battle Will and a smear of undetectable disappointment flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he still couldn’t make it in the end?</span></p>

Just when she was about to leave, her expression abruptly changed and she slowly turned her head back, looking at the depths of the forested mountain. At that location, the Nine Nether Troop that was quietly seated had abruptly opened their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Hurricanes of Battle Will sweep out as the scene of it became exceptionally spectacular.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether and the rest had also looked at that direction with astonishment in their eyes. After that, they saw the slender figure that was seated amongst the surging Battle Will for those three days slowly stand up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still that figure but not knowing why, there was a chilling Battle Will that was emitted from him right now.</span></p>

Nine Nether’s hand, which was tightly clenched, was also slowly loosening up at this moment and she felt that she was relieved of a significant load.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the horizon far away, Mu Chen’s silhouette moved and appeared before Nine Nether’s group. Shortly after, a smile appeared on his face. That smile was filled with an elated Battle Will to press forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorry, I have made you guys wait for a long time. Right now, let’s take the stake of the battle that belonged to us!”</span></p>

Their tightened hearts had loosened up completely.</span></p>
