Furthermore, what was more shocking was that the cities along their way had dismissed their defence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This abnormal situation made Nine Nether and Mu Chen somewhat astonished. But shortly after, they realised what was going on. The Demonic Lightning Sect wasn’t withdrawing in fear, but collating their strength to burst out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like they intend to battle us beneath the Demonic Lightning Mountains.” Nine Nether lightly smiled, there wasn’t any fear present in her slender eyes as she softly waved her hand, leading the army, and pressed forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half a day later, the army was finally slowing down near the plains that stretched to the end. The horizon was dark. There weren’t any lush green trees in the range of the mountains, only a thunderous roar that continuously rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those thunderous rumbles did not come from the sky, but from the depths of the earth. As they rumbled, the earth constantly trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A majestic black mountain was like a giant as it stood before them. The black mountain body looked like it was indestructible.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the many subsidiary forces of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>

Although the lightning energy was spread throughout this region, he could still faintly sense several powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this was the headquarters of the Demonic Lightning Sect.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, truly worthy of the Nine Nether King, truly a heroine.”</span></p>

Shortly after, dazzling lightning suddenly burst out from the Demonic Lightning Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That lightning poured down from the horizon from all directions. Under that dazzling lightning lustre, many figures appeared in the sky with a flash. Countless Spiritual Energy fluctuations that were suppressed before were unleashed without any reservation. In an instant, even the heavens and earth turned pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half of the figures in the sky had inharmonious Spiritual Energy fluctuations around them that was comparable to the Demonic Lightning Sect. Clearly, they weren’t from the Demonic Lightning Sect, but judging from their appearances, the Demonic Lightning Sect actually had the same idea as Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether recruited other subsidiary forces to attack the Demonic Lightning Sect, and the Demonic Lightning Sect had also pulled in other forces to give a fatal strike to the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Probably seventy to eighty percent of the forces in this southwest battlefield were gathered over here. Just this line-up was sufficient to launch a colossal war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze was focused on the central region, where the lightning was the most violent. Standing before the lightning was a figure that was floating in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a robust figure, covered in grey armour, with both his arms crossed before his chest. Greyish-black lightning flickered in the surface of his body as a powerful oppressive energy shrouded over, spreading out between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Demonic Lightning Sect, aside from the Sect Master, Qin Tiangang, who else could possess such strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the direction of the Great Havenlaw Domain, many forces fell into a slight disturbance when they saw that robust figure that looked like a demonic deity. After all, Qin Tiangang of the Demonic Lightning Sect’s name wasn’t small. It was so much so that it had even surpassed Nine Nether, to a certain degree. After all, Nine Nether’s status had been missing for all these years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve long heard of the Nine Nether King’s beauty, now that I have witnessed it today, the rumour isn’t fake. But fighting is something that belongs to men, and with your appearance, it’s somewhat hard to fight.” Qin Tiangang’s gaze was directed at Nine Nether as his laughter rang out like thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether faintly smiled from hearing his words and slowly took several steps forth. With every single step, a clear and crisp cry rang out between the heavens and earth as a terrifying Spiritual Energy spread out in this region. Vaguely, the horizon behind her formed into a massive blackbird, whose end could not be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crisp cry resounded as it dispersed the pressure that was coming from Qin Tiangang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Netherworld Bird?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless gazes in this region were directed at the blackbird with various expressions. Many people knew that Nine Nether was from the Nine Nether Bird Clan, but not many knew that she had already successfully evolved into a Divine Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Tiangang’s gaze slightly shrunk when he looked at the blackbird, even the expression on his face turned a little grave. Although Nine Nether was just a Fourth Grade Sovereign, even a Fifth Grade Sovereign would find it troublesome to deal with a Divine Beast. After all, the powerful vitality that belonged to Divine Beasts far exceeded humans, and they would naturally gain the advantage if they were to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Nether King, you’re really going to fight our Demonic Lightning Sect to the death?” Qin Tiangang solemnly said, “You should know that there aren’t any benefits for us to fight. Although both of our sides are having a war right now, there are many better targets than our Demonic Lightning Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? You’re scared now?” Nine Nether mocked with a smile, “If you don’t want to fight, I can let you guys leave as long as you hand over the Demonic Lightning Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Tiangang’s gaze grew cold. “This Sect Master was kind-hearted enough to not embarrass you for stepping down, but since you’re not tactful, do you really think that my Demonic Lightning Sect is a pushover?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will only find out whether you guys are pushovers or not after we fight.” Nine Nether said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you are so determined to find trouble with my Demonic Lightning Sect, it just so happens that I can destroy your Nine Nether Palace and raise the reputation of my Demonic Lightning Sect!” Qin Tiangang sneered as a chill flashed in his eyes. He naturally knew that an excellent increase in reputation for his Demonic Lightning Sect could gain if they destroyed the Nine Nether Palace. At that time, he would probably be able to use this leap to stand on the same level as the Myriad Swords Valley, Demonic Corpse Sect and Great Compassion Sky as a fourth peak force in the Hundred Battles Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And this ambition that he had was the reason why he worked so hard to pull together any scattered forces, preparing to start a war with the Nine Nether Palace with the advantage of terrain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid that you will not have the fortune to enjoy it.” Nine Nether calmly said as she stared at Qin Tiangang and continued, “Since you have prepared for so long, then my Nine Nether Palace will accompany you to wherever you want to play.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Tiangang sneered as he shifted his gaze and stopped on Mu Chen, who was behind Nine Nether, with a smile, “I have also heard of the boiling commotion that your Nine Nether Palace has caused in the Great Havenlaw Domain. I believe this kid is the new Commander of your Nine Nether Palace, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Mu Chen greets Sect Master Qin.” Mu Chen smiled with his fists cupped together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that the fame of your Nine Nether Troop is pretty great lately.” Qin Tiangang smiled with his eyes narrowed as he looked at Mu Chen and spoke as venomous as a snake, “In the past, everyone called your Nine Nether Troop a&nbsp;garbage collective. This Sect Master is also curious if all those matters you caused some time ago are real.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What does Sect Master Qin want to do?” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Tiangang indifferently waved his hand.</span></p>

Shortly after, the lightning slowly dispersed as a troop that was donned in greyish-black armour silently appeared behind Qin Tiangang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the appearance of that troop, a violent fluctuation instantly burst out. The gazes under the black metal armours seemed similar to that of ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Demonic Lightning House of the Demonic Lightning Sect, a troop with pretty decent fame as well.” Tang Bing said in a heavy voice behind Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slightly nodded his head. Before heading over, he had gotten some understanding towards the Demonic Lightning Sect. So he naturally knew of the troop called the Demonic Lightning House. It was a troop that was meticulously forged by the Demonic Lightning Sect. Speaking from a particular perspective, the fighting power of this troop probably wasn’t any weaker than the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure was dressed in greyish-black clothes with his hair scattered, looking a little unruly. But his appearance was pretty handsome, except that his thin lips looked like blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I am an Elder of the Demonic Lightning Sect, Qin Ling.” When that man appeared, he gave Mu Chen a light and gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when Mu Chen heard his name, he slightly narrowed his eyes. In the information he had, there was naturally some that belonged to Qin Ling. According to that information, he was one of the two Great Elders of the Demonic Lightning Sect with the cultivation of Third Grade Sovereign, and he was also the Commander of the Demonic Lightning House. Under his command, the Demonic Lightning House seized numerous cities from the Great Havenlaw Domain. It was so much so that there were even some subsidiary forces wiped out by him, so he could be considered as a ferocious figure.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I have also heard of Commander Mu Chen’s mighty deeds in the recent times. Our Demonic Lightning House has never annihilated such a famous opponent. Looks like I have to grab ahold of this opportunity.” Qin Ling let out a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m only afraid that the name of Demonic Lightning House will no longer exist in the Hundred Battles Domain after this.” Mu Chen lightly smiled in return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the two of them wore smiles on their faces, they crossed swords with their words. It was so much so that there was killing intent surging between them, causing many forces in this region to feel a slight chill in their hearts. Looks like the war today couldn’t be avoided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Nether King, let me experience how powerful you, the Nine Netherworld Bird, are!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Tiangang’s laughter rang out between the heavens and earth as his gaze abruptly grew cold. With a stomp of his feet, he soared towards the heavens as his roar resounded along with torrential killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qin Ling, destroy the Nine Nether Troop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will heed the Sect Master’s orders!” Qin Ling smiled with his fists cupped. His gaze that was directed at Mu Chen was similar to a cat that had seen a mouse.</span></p>
