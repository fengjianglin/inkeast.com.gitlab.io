They were looking at the towering silhouette that was emitting an intimidating aura, the Divine Pavilion Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, they had all been shocked by the words of the Divine Pavilion Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just a simple sentence and the reason behind it was extremely clear. The Divine Pavilion Master was clearly trying to dominate the entire Northern Region!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts in the Northern Region had attempted to achieve this grand wish over the past thousand years, but they had all resulted in failure. There’s no other reason except that there wasn’t a figure that could dominate the other peak forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, the Divine Pavilion Master wanted to become the Overlord that had never appeared in the past?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had such a thought, how would the rulers of the other peak forces allow him to do as he wished? After all, Earth Sovereigns were all prideful, so how could they lower their pride and bend their knees towards the Divine Pavilion Master?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Divine Pavilion Master was stronger than them in terms of cultivation, perhaps they might consider it. However, despite the Divine Pavilion Master having grown stronger and reached the Quasi-Greater Earth Sovereign Realm, it was clearly impossible to intimidate them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, there was still another Quasi-Greater Earth Sovereign Realm present here. Mandala was also at the same level as him. With her grudges with the Divine Pavilion Master, she would definitely not allow the Divine Pavilion Master to do as he wished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when the Divine Pavilion Master voiced his idea, the other forces were outraged and had also vaguely gotten their guards up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the five Earth Sovereigns had slightly flickered as they exchanged gazes, before they fell onto Mandala, at the end. Facing the all-mighty Divine Pavilion Master at this moment, they felt slightly fearful, so they did not dare to speak up, and were hoping that Mandala would stand out first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under their gazes, Mandala indifferently smiled with her golden pupils squinted. There were many grudges between the peak forces in the Northern Region. Despite her being extremely disgusted by the Divine Pavilion Master, she wouldn’t stand out for those fellows for nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the five Earth Sovereigns saw Mandala’s reaction, they all felt slightly resentful, before the Myriad Saint Ancestor of the Myriad Saint Peak said with an eye-narrowing smile, “Great Havenlaw Ruler, this matter concerns the overall situation in the Northern Region. So we hope that you can speak your thoughts about this… we would be grateful for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His tone contained hints of giving in, but he was clear that with the improvement of Mandala’s strength through this Hunting War, she had already surpassed them. In the future, it looked like his Myriad Saint Peak would have to walk closer to the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Earth Sovereigns also had changes in their eyes, before they all agreed to the words of the Myriad Saint Ancestor. Only Liu Tiandao of the Profound Sky Palace felt slightly uneasy, since he also had many past grudges with Mandala. Now that Mandala had grown stronger than him, he had no choice but to give in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala saw their reactions, she lightly smiled, then calmly said, “Divine Pavilion Master is truly so bold that you make one admire you. But my Great Havenlaw Domain does not agree with you, so you can look for others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Mandala had stated her stand, the other rulers of the peak forces felt inwardly relieved. The Myriad Saint Ancestor, Demon Emperor and Sky Serpent Old Ghost had also nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Liu Tiandao had not stated his stand, but his eyes flickered. No one knew what was he thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and the rest saw this scene, they could only exchange gazes, since this sort of confrontation had exceeded their levels and they could only watch how the situation would unfold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Looks like the few of you aren’t interested in my suggestion.” When the Divine Pavilion Master received such a reply, it didn’t seem to be too unexpected, since he showed a profound smile that made the five Earth Sovereigns’ hearts tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph. The appetite of your Divine Pavilion is a little too big. I want to watch how you will devour us and dominate the Northern Region.” The Demon Emperor had a cold character and even if he was fearful of the Divine Pavilion Master, he did not give in and coldly retorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to say some impolite things, if you want to dominate the entire Northern Region, I believe that you’re still not qualified with your cultivation at the Quasi-Greater Earth Sovereign Realm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those words were spoken out, the Divine Pavilion Master had squinted his eyes as he gently smiled. “So you guys are looking down on my strength because it is too low and I have not stepped into the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other rulers of the peak forces heard his reply, they kept quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Divine Pavilion Master saw their reactions, an abnormal arc rose on the corner of his lips and his gaze had instantly turned cold in the next moment, before he unleashed a roar that rumbled like thunder, resounding throughout this region, and caused the heavens and earth to tremble, before the faces of the experts of the various factions changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since that’s the case, then I will let you see how difficult it is for me to break through to the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke, not only did the faces of the five Earth Sovereigns change, even Mandala had narrowed her eyes, before shock was revealed on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s he talking about? He can still make another breakthrough in his cultivation?!” The other forces went into an uproar and the faces of the three Emperors were filled with disbelief. The Spiritual Divine Liquid had already been used up by the Divine Pavilion Master, and unless he could obtain a Perfect Spiritual Divine Liquid, he would definitely not be able to achieve that last step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether exchanged a glance and they could see the shock in each other’s eyes. After the shock, Mu Chen’s face had turned much darker. Although the Divine Pavilion Master’s words were hard to believe, he would definitely not speak meaninglessly at this moment. Since he had spoken those words, then he should have the means to achieve that step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no wonder why he would dare to speak such outrageous words, so he had concealed his trump card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had astonishment in their eyes as they looked at the Divine Pavilion Master, who opened his hands wide and a weird smile on his face. In that instant when he opened his hands, his eyes had become black as an ink-like black aura swept over, covering the sun and causing the surrounding space to shatter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black aura was extremely powerful and the inharmonious and bizarre energy was extremely cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Pavilion Master stood in the dark aura with his arms open and took in a deep breath. The black aura rolled and poured into his body through his nostrils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the ingestion of the black aura, the hair of the Divine Pavilion Master started to swiftly grow and the pressure that emanated from him grew at a stunning rate as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In less than ten breaths, the pressure that emanated from him had already exceeded Mandala’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of Mandala and the five Earth Sovereigns had completely turned ugly as they watched this scene in disbelief. Especially the black aura that made them feel a chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s that black aura?! Why is it so inharmonious with the Spiritual Energy between the heavens and earth…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Such evilness… the corrosive ability of it is extremely powerful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But this energy is too powerful. It doesn’t belong to the Divine Pavilion Master. How did he obtain it?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Earth Sovereigns couldn’t hold back and spoke with shock filling their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala fixed her eyes at the Divine Pavilion Master for a brief moment, before she suddenly thought of something and sucked in a cold breath, then clenched her teeth. “This energy is not from the Great Thousand World, it’s from the Fiend Clans!”</span></p>

The Divine Pavilion Master was actually so insane that he even dared to absorb the energy that didn’t belong to the Great Thousand World?</span></p>

It must be the energy left behind by the Skyeater Evil Emperor! It’s said that the Skyeater Evil Emperor’s Fallen Battlefield was obstructed by the Fourth Palace Master when an earth-shattering battle broke out. After that battle, the Fourth Palace Master fell and the Skyeater Evil Emperor was sealed!” The Myriad Saint Ancestor barked as his gaze trembled with shock. Clearly, he had guessed the origin of that energy.</span></p>

Previously, when the Divine Pavilion Master was knocked into the sea by the Spiritual Puppet, he must have secretly unsealed it and obtained a portion of energy left by the Skyeater Evil Emperor. That’s why he had not shown himself after so long!”</span></p>

So he wasn’t being foolish, he wanted to the sent to the depths of the ocean on purpose. It’s so that he could release the seal of the Skyeater Evil Emperor.</span></p>
