 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a lone peak, when Mu Chen, Nine Nether and the Blood Hawk King lead the two troops to land on this mountain, they already saw the Mountain Splitting King, Spiritual Sword King and Great Cliff King awaiting them there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have troubled the three of you this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them thanked the three other Kings with their fists cupped in an expression of their gratitude. If it weren’t for the three Kings coming on time, they would probably be the ones fleeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King waved his hand as he openly laughed, “As members of the Great Havenlaw Domain, it’s within our duties to help one another. King Mu and Nine Nether King truly have great hearts to be able to let go of the former grudges and aid the Blood Hawk Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the Mountain Splitting King cast a glance at the somewhat awkward Blood Hawk King. The latter had been too arrogant in the Great Havenlaw Domain, so even he didn’t have many favourable opinions of the Blood Hawk King in the past. Therefore, his words held thorns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Blood Hawk King was clearly a little grateful in his heart to be saved by Mu Chen and Nine Nether. Thus, he did not flare up from the Mountain Splitting King’s words. He looked towards Mu Chen and Nine Nether with his hands cupped together. “I will definitely repay this favour if opportunity allows in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps he was truly touched, since there was sincerity on the face of the Blood Hawk King that looked cold in the past. Seeing his performance, even the Mountain Splitting King’s gaze had turned a little more gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether exchanged a glance and smiled. Although they still had a small grudge from the Blood Hawk King’s past schemes, they were those that could weigh the situation well. That was why they had rushed over the moment they received the rescue signal from the Blood Hawk Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And, it looked like this rescue had slightly subdued the Blood Hawk King, which was an unexpected harvest. Although Mu Chen and Nine Nether were completely fearless of the Blood Hawk King, this could prevent some trouble, if no one obstructed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like after this event, King Mu’s fame will spread throughout the Hunting War. The Spirit of Battle Will is not something that ordinary people can refine.” The Spiritual Sword King smiled towards Mu Chen with a gaze filled with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King had nodded with a smile as well. “Amongst the peak forces in the Northern Region, there aren’t many that can refine the Spirit of Battle Will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s someone from the other peak forces that has refined the Spirit of Battle Will as well?” Mu Chen’s gaze shook. Judging from the Mountain Splitting King’s words, that basically meant that there were others amongst the peak forces that had achieved it as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Northern Region is not lacking in geniuses, so there is always some with exceptional talent in this field. Those people are the gathering targets of the various peak forces.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King nodded. “According to some of the information that I have received, there are at least 5 that have successfully refined the Spirit of Battle Will. But those Battle Will geniuses aren’t the same as Fang Yi. Because of their importance, various peak forces have concealed their information. So it’s not easy for others to know about their existences, and those peak forces wouldn’t reveal them as well. That’s because it would lure assassinations…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. Previously, when Fang Yi knew he could refine the Spirit of Battle Will, Fang Yi had used all means in an attempt to kill him. It was because Fang Yi knew how threatening a person that could refine the Spirit of Battle Will was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, judging from an accurate point of view, a person that could refine the Spirit of Battle Will possessed the qualification to become a Battle Formation Master… Even if the chances were one in ten thousand, what would happen if he managed to succeed? It would definitely be a great power in a peak force that possessed a huge amount of elite troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Mu Chen could understand the peak forces’ actions of concealing their Battle Will geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which forces do those five belong to?” Mu Chen asked after briefly pondering. He naturally had to grasp such important information. That’s because, who knew when he might fight with those Battle Will geniuses that the various peak forces had concealed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Pavilion, Netherworld Palace, Sky Profound Palace, Demon Gate and Myriad Saint Peak…” The Mountain Splitting King shrugged his shoulders as he helplessly said, “Our Great Havenlaw Domain has also tried to recruit those Battle Will geniuses, but due to the fact that the Domain Ruler has always been in a deep slumber, it hasn’t been put to heart… Therefore, there has not been a single Battle Will genius in our Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the Mountain Splitting King was a little gratified as he looked at Mu Chen. “But, you came along, which allowed our Great Havenlaw Domain to possess a Battle Will genius.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly smiled, since he knew that it wasn’t that Mandala didn’t want to put her heart into it, but she had been in a deep slumber to suppress the curse in her body and did not have any time left to manage the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, do you have any news of the Battle Will geniuses of the Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace?” Mu Chen briefly pondered, before asking. He had quite a bit of grudge with those two forces, so he had to pay special attention to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King stroked his chin as he answered, “The Battle Will genius of the Divine Pavilion seems to be a female, while the one in the Sky Profound Palace is a lunatic…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he looked at the Mountain Splitting King. “Nothing else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King spread his hands out as he said, “Nothing else. This sort of information has always been deeply concealed by the various forces, so they are unknown until they show themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help rolling his eyes. Those pieces of information were practically the same as having nothing said. But, since that’s the case, Mu Chen could only forget it and could only leave a consideration in his heart now that he knew their existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the danger here is resolved, we will be making our move. Time is precious and we have to search for ruins to gather Fallen Origin Pellets.” The Mountain Splitting King waved his hand as he took the initiative to leave first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen went into silence, before looking at the four present Kings and smiled. “I have a suggestion. We can join together to search for ruins. This way, we can prevent a situation like today from occurring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t common to have four Kings gathered here, and these were all free helpers. If he could gather them together, it could definitely increase their efficiency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s words, the Mountain Splitting King and the three other Kings were stunned, before frowning. “Although we will be powerful if we are gathered together, it will also lower our speed. The gains do not make up for the losses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had also thought about gathering together, but the ruins were too hard to find in this Fallen Battlefield. They had to split up so that their efficacy was at its best. If they were bundled together, they would probably fail their task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he straightforwardly asked, “How many Fallen Origin Pellets have you guys gathered so far?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have found two Grade-3 Ruins with 300 Fallen Origin Pellets in my hand.” The Blood Hawk King had no idea what was Mu Chen trying to say, but he still spoke out first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I only have slightly more than 200.” The Spiritual Sword King helplessly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Same for me.” The Great Cliff King smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King cast a glance at the three of them, before laughing with pride in his laughter, “Looks like my luck is slightly better. I have 500 with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three other Kings heard his words, they couldn’t help exclaiming as they looked at the Mountain Splitting King in envy. It wasn’t an easy task to search for hidden ruins in the Fallen Battlefield and they had to be wary of interference from other forces as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the complacent Mountain Splitting King and couldn’t hold back his smile. “We have a total of 1,200 Fallen Origin Pellets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King swallowed his laughter as the three remaining Kings looked at Mu Chen in shock. 1,200 Fallen Origin Pellets was definitely a huge sum for them right now. At least seven or eight Grade-3 Ruins had to be raided before such an amount could be refined. Could it be that Mu Chen’s party could run into ruins as they moved?</span></p>

He looked at the four Kings with their eyes widened as he continued, “A small portion is from Xu Ba earlier, and the rest was all refined by us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How many ruins have you guys found?!” The Mountain Splitting King spoke in disbelief. The reason why he could obtain 500 Fallen Origin Pellets was that there were two ignorant fools that attempted to rob them and were robbed instead by their Mountain Splitting Troop. Otherwise, they would only have around 300 right now.</span></p>

If it wasn’t for the fact that they had an understanding towards Mu Chen’s character, they would have thought that Mu Chen was bluffing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing their gazes, Mu Chen didn’t find it baffling. He shrugged his shoulders. “We obtained a treasure in the Fallen Battlefield that can detect the location of other ruins, so…”</span></p>

The four of them looked at Mu Chen with heated gazes, since they knew what those words Mu Chen had said meant. A treasure that could search the traces of ruins in the Fallen Battlefield was a Divine Artifact for the other forces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With such a treasure, gathering Fallen Origin Pellets was basically no effort at all!</span></p>

If it wasn’t for Mu Chen being a member of the Great Havenlaw Domain, they would probably even have the intention to rob him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing their gazes, Mu Chen smiled with his eyes narrowed. “Now, I’d like to invite the four of you to travel with me. If we’re lucky enough, we might even be able to find some Grade-1 Ruins!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King and the three other Kings licked their lips as they ferociously nodded their heads without hesitation.</span></p>

The efficiency between those two options could be easily determined even for a blind man.</span></p>
