 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five days passed in the blink of an eye and when the fifth day arrived, the party from the Nine Netherbird Clan had arrived as promised at the Greatlaw Sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greatlaw Sky, the Reception Palace</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Netherbird Clan had an extremely long history amongst the Spiritual Beasts in the Great Thousand World. So when they arrived in the Great Havenlaw Domain, even Mandala had given them face by putting down her cultivation and personally came out to welcome them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the palace, Mandala stood with her hands behind her back, along with the three Emperors, Mu Chen and Nine Nether. Except that, at this moment, Nine Nether seemed to be absent-minded and Mu Chen was clear that she was worried in her heart. But there’s no meaning in speaking anymore. Since the party from the Nine Netherbird Clan would be here, then they could only see their attitudes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, although the Nine Netherbird Clan is powerful, our Great Havenlaw Domain is not weak, either. They can dream on acting as they wish under my watch.” Mandala cast a glance at Mu Chen and Nine Nether as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With her eyesight, she naturally knew what Nine Nether was worried about. She and Mu Chen had engaged a Bloodlink Bond, it was a contract that bound their lives and deaths together. If one party died, the other would definitely follow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, the Bloodlink Bond wasn’t rare amongst the clans of Spiritual Beasts. It’s just that the majority of them would be towards two powerful and equal Spiritual Beasts. That way, the both of them could obtain benefits from each other. But right now, Mu Chen was clearly not a Spiritual Beast with a powerful bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, to those Spiritual Beasts with special bloodlines, they all had contempt for humans. That’s because, under the general situation, a Spiritual Beast on the same level as a human would be stronger, since they possessed their innate talent and physiques that were far stronger than a human’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their view, the majority of humans were weak. They would easily die before they could become genuine experts, so they were extremely disdainful of the human’s bloodlines. In their view, aside from contaminating the purity of the Spiritual Beast’s bloodline, there wasn’t any benefit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, in some conservative Spiritual Beasts Clans, if there were any Spiritual Beasts that formed a Bloodlink Bond with a human, they would be viewed as rebels and they would die with their blood drained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, that’s why Nine Nether was so worried in her heart. She wasn’t worried that the Nine Netherbird Clan would do a thing to her, since her father was the current Patriarch of the Nine Netherbird Clan and, in addition to her excellent talent, her position was revered. There wouldn’t be anyone in the clan that would dare to do anything to her, but she was worried that after the Nine Netherbird Clan knew of this matter, they would do something to Mu Chen…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mandala’s guarantee, only then did she feel a little relieved, before nodding her head towards the former with gratitude. Just when she was about to speak, her eyes suddenly contracted and she raised her head to see a bolt of lightning streaking over from the distant horizon. In just a few breaths of time, they could already see that bolt of lightning. It was a bird, enveloped with purple lightning that was whizzing through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That purple bird hovered above the palace, before it descended, landing before Mandala’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, this old man is known as Tianque, an Elder of the Nine Netherbird Clan. I apologize for disturbing you today, Great Havenlaw Ruler.” When several light figures appeared, an aged laughter rang out with an astonishing pressure of Spiritual Energy that swept out, causing the entire region to be constrained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the light gradually faded, several silhouettes had appeared before the Reception Palace with an azure-robed elder leading the party. His robes were decorated with a skylark that also emitted a powerful pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shocking Spiritual Energy pressure naturally came from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing behind the azure-robed elder were several silhouettes. The one that attracted the most attention was a slender youth dressed in azure clothes as well. He had a handsome appearance, with sharp brows and thin lips, and was spewing a sharp light from his eyes that drew attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three Emperors that stood behind Mandala felt that pressure, they had knitted their brows as well. It seems like this group of people were rather powerful. Were they trying to test the capability of their Great Havenlaw Domain? It looked like there would be a fight before anything good happened… it looked like the matter today wouldn’t be so simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it’s Elder Tianque of the Nine Netherbird Clan. Since there’s such a noble guest arriving, my Great Havenlaw Domain will do our utmost best to receive you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the three Emperors frowned their brows, Mandala slightly smiled. Although she did not make a single movement, as her voice resounded, there was a calm fluctuation that spread out, instantly calming the shocking might that was brought by the other party. It was so much so that even the suppressed region had restored its calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her actions had caused the azure-robed elder’s eyes to contract and he gathered his attention onto Mandala, before his gaze turned solemn. “I never expected the Great Havenlaw Ruler to start coming into contact with the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm. Looks like, not far from now, you will be able to step into that realm completely. It’s truly something worth celebrating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Tianque’s strength was in the Lesser Earth Sovereign Realm with an extremely noble status in the Nine Netherbird Clan. According to his initial estimation, the Great Havenlaw Ruler was, at most, on the same level as him. So if they had to fight after their talk broke down, he should be able to gain the upper hand with the advantage as a Divine Beast. But judging from the current situation, Mandala’s strength had exceeded his expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Greater Earth Sovereign Realm, even in their Nine Netherbird Clan, those existences belonged to the highest level and he never expected to meet such a powerful figure in a regional force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile was also revealed on Mandala’s face as she replied, “Thanks for your praise, Elder Tianque.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She naturally knew how prideful the Spiritual Beast Clans were. Furthermore, judging from the previous attitude, they clearly came with malevolent intentions. If it wasn’t for her obtaining a breakthrough from the Hunting War, Elder Tianque would probably not look so polite at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Tianque gently smiled, before looking at a silhouette and smiled with his eyes squinted. “Little Nine Nether, this old man has some so far to bring you back, you still want to hide from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nine Nether saw the gaze Elder Tianque was directing over, she helplessly walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Elder Tianque saw Nine Nether walking out, his desolate eyes flickered with a lustre as he examined Nine Nether, before revealing a joyful smile on his face in the next instant. “You really did become a Nine Netherworld Bird. Lass, you have really awakened this bloodline… You’re indeed the one with the best bloodline in our clan over the last few thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw this scene, he couldn’t help asking the Sky Vulture Emperor with puzzlement, “It’s very hard for the Nine Netherbird Clan to awaken the bloodline of the Nine Netherworld Bird?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Elder Tianque’s words, it seemed there weren’t that many in the Nine Netherbird Clan that could awaken this bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Nine Netherbirds are Spiritual Beasts to begin with. But as they evolve, there can be many branches. For example, the Nine Netherflame Bird, Nine Netherfrost Bird, etc… But the branch of the Nine Netherworld Bird is the rarest because those that could evolve into a Nine Netherworld Bird means that they possessed the bloodline of the Undying Bird. If they have enough opportunity, they might be able to evolve into an Undying Bird, which is a genuine Divine Beast, and also amongst the highest level of the Divine Beast Record.” The Sky Vulture Emperor chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to my knowledge, Nine Nether is the only one over the past few thousand years to be able to evolve into the Nine Netherworld Bird.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard his words, he couldn’t help inwardly smacking his lips. In the past, he only knew that Nine Nether had a pretty good talent, so he never expected that she would be so rare amongst the Nine Netherbird Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen was conversing with the Sky Vulture Emperor in low voice, Nine Nether forced a smile towards Elder Tianque before continuing, “Thank you, Elder, for coming to receive me. But since you’re here, then let us prepare to go back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she finished her words, the handsome fellow standing behind Elder Tianque slightly smiled. “Your Highness Nine Nether, we’re not in a rush to return. We have other matters to attend to during our arrival this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” Nine Nether coldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Liu Qing, a Deacon of our Clan’s Law Enforcement Division.” The youth smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Qing?” Nine Nether contracted her eyes, since that name sounded somewhat familiar. Back then, when she left the Nine Netherbird Clan, this person was a well-known figure amongst the younger generations in the clan. But she never expected for him to become a Deacon by now. Such an improvement could be considered speedy.</span></p>

Little Nine Nether, don’t make things difficult for that brat Liu Qing…” Elder Tianque smiled. His initial muddy eyes suddenly turned sharp as he continued, “You have the most outstanding bloodline of our clan over the past few thousand years and your Life Plaque has been left in the Ancestral Shrine. It’s just that before we arrived, we realised that your Life Plaque was mixed with a slight impurity that originates from the bloodline. So this old man is here today to clear things up.”</span></p>

But be rest assured, if there’s anyone in the world that dares to force you to conduct a Bloodlink Bond, our Nine Netherbird Clan will definitely fight to the death with them!”</span></p>
