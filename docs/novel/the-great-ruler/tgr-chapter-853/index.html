 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were actually three King force troops from the Great Havenlaw Domain that came over this time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, in this region, just the troops of the Divine Pavilion and Great Havenlaw Domain had nearly a hundred thousand in number, this could basically start a large-scaled battle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other forces that were watching this battle all started to quietly retreat. Judging from the current situation, once a battle starts, it would definitely become a bloody battle between the Divine Pavilion and Great Havenlaw Domain. If they were dragged into the battle, they wouldn’t be able to bear the annihilating outcome with their strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the other forces were swiftly retreating from this region, the faces of Fang Yi, Xu Ba, the Fire Wolf Lord and Sky Bear Lord had slightly ugly expressions on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had not expected such powerful reinforcements from the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King could be ranked within the top three amongst the Kings in Great Havenlaw Domain. The Great Cliff King and Spiritual Sword King both had decent reputations as well, their troops were also extremely powerful. After adding the Nine Nether Palace and wounded Blood Hawk Hall, the strength of the two parties had been turned around in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because they only had three Sixth Grade Sovereigns in their party, while the Great Havenlaw Domain grew from two to five!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a bloody battle was to break out, their Divine Pavilion would definitely have to pay a heavy price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to Fang Yi and the rest, who had ugly expressions, Nine Nether and the Blood Hawk King felt relieved. Fortunately, the reinforcements came in time. Otherwise, they would be in trouble today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you’re also planning on reinforcements.” Nine Nether gave Mu Chen a glance. Mu Chen was actually as cunning as Fang Yi, both having their own sinister schemes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We would have to pay a price if our Nine Nether Palace wanted to take down the Skycroc Troop. So waiting for reinforcements was the appropriate choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled. “Except that I never expected Fang Yi to have the same thought as well. Fortunately, we are luckier, since our reinforcements are stronger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether nodded her head and had finally rested her heart. Right now, the situation was in their Great Havenlaw Domain’s favour. This time, it’s Fang Yi, Xu Ba and those of the Divine Pavilion that needed to be worrying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. And here I was wondering who made a move against our Great Havenlaw Domain. So it’s those from the Divine Pavilion. But there doesn’t seem to be any formidable figures. What’s wrong? Sky Dragon Lord and White Tiger Lord aren’t here?” Up in the sky, the Mountain Splitting King stood before the torrential Battle Will of his troop, with his hands placed behind his back. His laughter brought along a great pressure that rang out in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King had an extraordinary bearing and could be ranked at the Top Three amongst the Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain. In terms of fame, it was even stronger than Nine Nether, Blood Hawk King and the two other Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And he definitely had the strength to pair with his bearing. Although he was also a Sixth Grade Sovereign, Mu Chen could vaguely sense that the pressure emanating from his body was slightly stronger than the other Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this region, there didn’t seem to be any expert more powerful than the Mountain Splitting King present here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when he spoke out, his words made the faces of Xu Ba, the Fire Wolf Lord and Sky Bear Lord’s faces turn dark, but they did not refute his words. That’s because they could also sense that the Mountain Splitting Lord’s cultivation had reached the pinnacle of the Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm, a level stronger than their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the Sky Dragon Lord and White Dragon Lord were present, perhaps Mountain Splitting King wouldn’t be saying such words.” Fang Yi was calmer. He looked at the Mountain Splitting King and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an elite that was heavily nurtured by the Divine Pavilion, Fang Yi naturally had more experience. So he naturally wouldn’t be intimidated my the Mountain Splitting King’s cultivation being at the pinnacle of the Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s pointless to make such meaningless hypothesis, Brother Fang Yi.” Mu Chen had also spoken with a smile. The ridicule on the corner of his lips made Fang Yi’s face turn cold, and the latter must’ve been raging with flames in his heart. The situation that was initially under Fang Yi’s control was turned around. The rabbit in his mouth had grown sharper teeth and tried to bite back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think that you have already won since your reinforcements are stronger?” Fang Yi’s words were cold as he looked at Mu Chen with his sharp gaze. “If we were to fight, you guys have to pay a price, as well. So I recommend you guys—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen was clearly not bothered by his threat. He did not wait for Fang Yi to finish his words and had raised his head towards the three Kings. “Let’s make our move. Since you have already come, we naturally have to see some blood. Otherwise, others might say that our Great Havenlaw Domain only knows how to put up a show.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blood Hawk King, when we make our move, I’ll have to trouble you to lead the Blood Hawk Troop to kill your way out as well!” His gaze shifted and looked at the Blood Hawk Hall in the valley, then he spoke in a solemn voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King laughed with admiration in his laughter. Mu Chen was clearly to his liking in his decisive decisions. Since they had already gotten the upper hand, they naturally had to give it their all. As for the price, everything required a price and they couldn’t be stopped just because they had to pay some price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the Mountain Splitting King’s laughter, the Mountain Splitting Army unleashed a thunderous roar and their voices echoed in this region along with astonishing Battle Will soaring into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting Army’s numbers had exceeded ten thousand, far exceeding the Nine Nether Troop. Just from that alone, one could see the deep foundation of the Mountain Splitting Hall in the Great Havenlaw Domain. Even if the Nine Nether Troop had tried to catch up in the past year, they were still lacking when compared to veteran King forces in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the two other Kings, they had also activated their Battle Wills along with the Mountain Splitting Army. The three troops had locked onto the Fire Wolf Troop and Sky Bear Troop as Battle Will erupted from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of Fang Yi, Xu Ba and the rest turned pale. They did not expect Mu Chen to be so decisive, disregarding the price that they would have to pay for this bloody battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What shall we do now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi, Xu Ba, the Fire Wolf Lord and Sky Bear Lord conversed under the envelopment of Spiritual Energy. Based on the current situation, the Great Havenlaw Domain had the upper hand. If Mu Chen, the Mountain Splitting King and the rest were truly willing to pay the price, those three troops of the Divine Pavilion would definitely, greatly suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi’s face changed, before he gritted his teeth. “Let’s retreat. We have to preserve our strength. There’s no need to fight with this disadvantage in numbers. We’ll wait till the army of our Divine Pavilion gathers and we’ll find the chance to pay back this day’s debt!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Ba, the Fire Wolf Lord and Sky Bear Lord could only nod their heads with their teeth clenched. If they were to fight in the current situation, they would definitely suffer heavy casualties. Although the Great Havenlaw Domain would pay a price as well, their Divine Pavilion would suffer greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since they had already made a decision, they no longer hesitated and waved their hands. The troops behind them burst forth with vast Battle Will, forming into beams of light that shot towards three directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you guys have already come, then leave something behind!” The Mountain Splitting Lord coldly snorted at the sight of this, then abruptly waved his hand. Instantly, the Battle Will of the Mountain Splitting Army swept out, forming into innumerable pikes that enveloped towards the retreating Sky Bear Troop.</span></p>

Thus, the instant when they saw the attacks coming at their directions, they had also utilised their Battle Wills into defence. Boundless Battle Wills clashed together, causing this region to tremble.</span></p>

As the Battle Wills clashed, the Battle Wills of the two latter troops undulated with dull light figures occasionally falling from their troops' formations. Those were heavily injured or dead warriors…</span></p>

A golden light flickered on the surface of his body. The wounds left behind from his battle with Fang Yi were almost recovered with the powerful recovery abilities that were comparable to Divine Beasts.</span></p>

After waiting for so long, she could finally make her move.</span></p>

Mu Chen clearly felt fearful of that fellow, since he could only force Fang Yi to a situation with the both of them heavily injured, despite exerting various trump cards, which also made Mu Chen understand that the title of being the Overlord of the Dragon-Phoenix Record was fully justified.</span></p>

After enduring for half a day, it was finally time for them to unleash their fury!</span></p>
