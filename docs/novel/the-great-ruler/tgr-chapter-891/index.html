 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The boundless ocean of Battle Will gathered above the five troops and had spread out between the heavens and earth as they flew over. There were five massive Spirits of Battle Will in that ocean of Battle Will, emanating an astonishing oppression that was filled with deep roars that trembled the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was quite intimidating when the five Battle Will Spirits appeared. Even the experts of the Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace had shocking expressions on their faces and their gazes turned grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Mu is finally out.” The Mountain Splitting King and the rest felt heavily relieved. It was undoubtedly a little forceful for them to confront the two peak forces. If it wasn’t for them having a powerful formation, they might have already been devoured by the Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But fortunately, they managed to last until Mu Chen appeared. With the latter’s ability, along with being able to control the Battle Will of the five troops, even the other Sixth Grade Sovereigns would have to be fearful of him. In terms of intimidation, it was much stronger than a pinnacle Sixth Grade Sovereign like the Mountain Splitting King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But contrary to their joy, Fang Yi and Liu Yan had dark expressions upon Mu Chen’s appearance. The both of them had a chill surging in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Fang, it’s not easy for us to trap them so we can’t let that fellow ruin everything!” Liu Yan looked at Fang Yi and said in a heavy voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi nodded his head, but he frowned his brows. Both the top experts of their forces had gone to hold up the Kings, they couldn’t distribute any Sixth Grade Sovereigns to deal with Mu Chen. Just with the two of them, it’s impossible for them to confront Mu Chen, who was in control of five troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liuli, can you still fight?” Fang Yi turned to the side to look at Zhantai Liuli, whose face was a little pale. If the latter could control the Azure Troop at this moment, it would be an easy task to deal with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in contrast to their expectations, Zhantai Liuli shook her head with a bitter smile. “Not possible. I’m too heavily injured and if I forcefully commanded the Battle Will, I would be countered by it instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her speech, Fang Yi felt a little disappointed but there was nothing he could do. After all, on the surface, Zhantai Liuli’s injuries didn’t look light, so he couldn’t force her to command the Azure Troop to deal with Mu Chen. After all, this was a troop that their Divine Pavilion had heavily nurtured with their resources. So if they were to lose such a troop, it would be too much of a loss for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave that Mu Chen for me to deal with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Fang Yi felt a little headache, an eerie laughter resounded, filled with arrogance. Looking at the source of the voice, Fang Yi saw Xiao Tian walking out from the back of Liu Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although my Sky Profound Division has suffered some losses in the Azure Dragon Battle Formation, it’s still a complete troop, whereas Mu Chen’s force is just a bunch of mashed-up troops. It’ll be as easy as flipping my hand to annihilate him.” As Xiao Tian spoke, he cast a sinister glance at Zhantai Liuli. If it wasn’t for her schemes, he wouldn’t have been in the Azure Dragon Battle Formation, which caused the Sky Profound Division to suffer a heavy loss and even lose the qualification to obtain the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Zhantai Liuli was indifferent to his glance having no reaction to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I’ll have to trouble Brother Xiao to deal with him.” Fang Yi felt relieved upon hearing that. Indeed, Xiao Tian was a powerful opponent after commanding Battle Will. The reason why he couldn’t break through the Battle Formation was merely due to him being unfortunate and landing in the strongest Azure Dragon Battle Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Xiao Tian’s Sky Profound Division did look to be stronger than Mu Chen’s five mashed-up troops. With him taking action, even if he couldn’t get rid of Mu Chen, it wouldn’t be hard for him to hold Mu Chen up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Fang Yi’s words, the corner of Zhantai Liuli’s lips rose into an unnoticeable mockery. These fools only knew how to look on the surface. Since Mu Chen could break through the Black Tortoise Battle Formation at the same time as her with his five mashed-up troops, that meant that he had powerful attainments in battle formations. If it wasn’t for the Battle Wills of the five troops being hard to control, he might even probably be the first to have broken through the battle formation and even she wouldn’t have caught up to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she did not have any favourable opinion of Xiao Tian, so she naturally wouldn’t speak anything to warn him about it and would only coldly watch from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I can deal with him, then I think your pavilion should give me a share in the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor, right?” Xiao Tian’s gaze turned as he suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Liu Yan heard his words, he smiled as well. “Yeah. Brother Fang, since we’re cooperating right now, you can’t let us work for nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi had his brows slightly knitted, then he cast a glance at Mu Chen. He briefly pondered, before clenching his teeth. “Sure! As long as you can get rid of Mu Chen, you’ll get a share in the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Brother Fang is generous. Then watch how I bring his head over!” Xiao Tian rejoiced, then cast a glance at the cold-faced Zhantai Liuli before waving his hand. Behind him, the Sky Profound Division, which numbered over 20,000 members, erupted with a startling battle roar as their Battle Will swept out like a storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Tian took the initiative to fly out with the Sky Profound Division following up closely below him. They’re like a huge patch of black clouds that appeared before Mu Chen and five troops, obstructing their path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen. you should turn around and flee right now, in case you won’t get a chance to do it later.” Xiao Tian stood in the sky as he coldly sneered while eerily looking at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Xiao Tian’s hooting, Mu Chen had only indifferently smiled, then waved his hand. “Scram.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death! Did you really think that since you have fought against me once, you’re qualified to be so arrogant with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Tian’s face turned dark, as if water was about to drip of his face, then he looked sinisterly at Mu Chen. “In a bit, I’ll slaughter all of your troops. I’ll see if you still dare to speak so arrogantly to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Tian suddenly waved his hand and a torrential Battle Will swept out behind him, forming a huge Python Battle Will Spirit. That Battle Will Spirit was undoubtedly larger and more ferocious than the previous one used to fight with Mu Chen. Compared to any of Mu Chen’s Battle Will Spirits, it’s scale was way larger and the Battle Will rolled along with its hisses that incinerated the surrounding space like magma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>

In the instant of collision, a shock wave spread out, which caused the surrounding space to tremble from the force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!”</span></p>

Its massive figure had runes flickering on it, which was extremely intimidating.</span></p>

But facing the envelopment of five Battle Will Spirits, the Python Battle Will Spirit was fearless and had used its overbearing Battle Will to push a Battle Will Spirit back in every clash. And looking at the attacks of the five Battle Will Spirits, they did not pose many obstructions to the Python Battle Will Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Mu Chen, did you really think that these mashed-up troops can be comparable to my elite troop? Even if we are similar in quantity, the Battle Will of my Sky Profound Division far exceeds your five mashed-up troops!” Xiao Tian couldn’t hold himself back from mocking at this sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From afar, when Fang Yi and Liu Yan saw Xiao Tian gaining the upper hand from their confrontation, they felt a slight relief, before commanding the experts under them to quicken their fights to defeat the Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli coldly looked at this scene. If he merely had these means, then he definitely wouldn’t have been able to get through the Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit, so it was too early for Xiao Tian to be rejoicing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far away, Mu Chen was calmly looking at the Python Battle Will Spirit that was unleashing a godly might. His gaze lightly flickered as he muttered to himself, “Xiao Tian’s Battle Will Spirit actually has nearly 8,000 runes…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his previous probings, he had sensed that Xiao Tian’s Battle Will Spirit had 8,000 runes, which was definitely much stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if he wanted to defeat Mu Chen with just 8,000 runes, Xiao Tian was probably too naïve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze flickered and he abruptly stomped his feet. With a will of his heart, the five Battle Will Spirits that were unleashing attacks at the Python Battle Will Spirit suddenly soared into the sky, before violently clashing together under countless startled gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boundless Battle Will spread out as the five completely different Battle Will Spirits clashed together. The violent undulations had cause ripples in the surrounding space from the trembles. Vaguely, they had had formed into a massive dazzling sphere of light with surging oceans of Battle Will within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You actually dared to combine five completely different Battle Wills together and are unafraid of the backlash? Did you really think that you’re a Battle Formation Master?!” Xiao Tian squinted his eyes at this scene as he coldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his voice, the corner of Mu Chen’s lips rose into a cold arc and a rumble suddenly descended from the sky. Every single expert abruptly raised their heads and witnessed in shock the five-coloured pillar of light that was roughly few thousand feet in size bursting out from the light sphere!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That five-coloured pillar of light seemed like it had an actual form, emanating horrifying undulations with runes covering that pillar of light. There were runes of different colours that did not make the Battle Wills on it look harmonious. Instead, it looked even more violent after clashing with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if it was emanating an annihilation.</span></p>

That’s because she did not expect that Mu Chen could achieve this step, combining different Battle Wills together. That was a means that only belonged to genuine Battle Formation Masters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, what made her feel even more shocked was that she realised that there were actually over 9,000 runes on that five-coloured pillar of light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was endlessly close to reaching ten thousand runes!</span></p>
