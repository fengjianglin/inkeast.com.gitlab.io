 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-b6b11374-7fff-d10e-cb93-e11a3187e1c0" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chapter 678 - Commanding the Nine Nether Troop</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength dividing of the Great Havenlaw Domain was extremely peculiar. Aside from those wielding troops themselves, every single King force had their own troops. And if those King forces wished to obtain more territory, they would have to seize and devour other ones with their own troops.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, every single King force would put great development to their troops, strengthening them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking the Asura Troop of the Asura Palace, Mountain Splitting Army of the Mountain Splitting Hall, and Blood Hawk Hall’s Blood Hawk Army for example…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, although those troops were powerful, everyone knew that the most fearsome that was publicly known would be the direct army of the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Great Havenlaw Army. However, that army wasn’t controlled by anyone as it belonged to the deep and unfathomable Sleeping Emperor and also that mysterious Domain Ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Nine Nether Troop, it was an army of the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, due to Nine Nether leaving for so many years and in addition to her being no good at managing her army, the Nine Nether Troop was the weakest amongst the Nine Kings when she left. But fortunately, Tang Bing managed it when she wasn’t present and allowed the Nine Nether Troop to be strengthened instead. Although it still couldn’t be compared to the Asura Troop, who had sufficient resources, it was much stronger compared to before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether Palace, Training Field</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vast training field was filled with countless black figures, all of them donned in black armour, standing quietly. They were like boulders without any movements, their breathing was united. As they breathed, it was like thunder and lightning, the imposing manner was extremely fearsome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several steaks of light flew over and appeared right before them. It was Nine Nether, Mu Chen, and the sisters Tang Bing and Tang Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We greet the Palace Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nine Nether appeared, the thousand boulder-like figures respectfully bowed with their fists against their chests. An orderly voice rang out like lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood on the highest platform as he looked at this army that was like a patch of thunderclouds. Shock flashed across his eyes as well. This was a genuine army. Their breathing was one as the Spiritual Energies shrouded around them. There wasn’t any rejection from their convergence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was clearly something that could only be achieved with months of working together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Nether Palace has always maintained a scale of a thousand people. We have chosen an elimination method, the last hundred in every year’s test would be eliminated, while the rest would become the power of the Nine Nether Palace, ultimately displaying the force of the newcomers.” Tang Bing lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was slightly astonished as he sighed in his heart about how formidable this girl was. She had completely given up the advantage of numbers and chose quality with such a cruel elimination rate. But this was also the reason why the Nine Nether Troop was so refined, all of them had reached the level of the Three Sovereign Disasters, several figures that stood in the front even showed vague signs of breaking through to the Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this army. If they were to attack all together, even Mu Chen, who had refined the Great Solar Undying Body, would not be able to dodge their sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pretty good.” Nine Nether praised.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like it was a wise thing to hand the Nine Nether Troop over to Tang Bing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, this was only something that we managed to achieve with the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid we had.” Tang Bing helplessly smiled. She wished to expand the Nine Nether Troop as well, but there was a limit to the amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids that the Nine Nether Palace could obtain in a year. If they were to forcefully expand, it might hurt the foundation of the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have done well.” Nine Nether patted Tang Bing’s shoulder. Dor all these years, Tang Bing had even forked over her share of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid and gave them to the Nine Nether Palace. Her contributions made even Nine Nether feel a little guilty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s nothing.” Tang Bing lightly smiled as she looked at the Nine Nether Troop. Her voice gradually turned cold and awed, “From today onwards, Mu Chen will become the Commander of the Nine Nether Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, there were soft voices coming from the boulder-like Nine Nether Troop. Their gazes fell onto the figure of the youth on the platform as they turned silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silence at this sort of time was a clear representation their refusal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys have an opinion about it?” Tang Bing’s brows slightly lifted as she said with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Tang Bing, no one would have a single comment if you were the one leading our Nine Nether Troop.” Standing at the front of the Nine Nether Palace, there was a voice that resounded, it was a man with a robust build. He was donning black armour and had a spear in his hand. His expression was firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We all know about the difficulties the Nine Nether Palace has been through for all these years and you have forsaken your share of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid to our Nine Nether Troop. So we respect you. If those words from earlier was an order, we would definitely follow, but I’m afraid that some brothers would be unhappy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze fell onto the robust man with a smear of surprise flashing across his eyes. He realised that the strength of that man had reached First Grade Sovereign Realm, except judging from the fluctuations of Spiritual Energy around him, he had yet to refine his Sovereign Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That strength made Mu Chen somewhat startled, since he never expected that there would be Sovereign experts amongst the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swept his gaze around and realised that there were two figures quietly standing beside that robust man. The fluctuations of Spiritual Energies around them weren’t any weaker than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three Sovereign Realm experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those three are the strongest among our Nine Nether Troop. Their prestige is also the highest. Initially, they all had the hope of becoming a Commander…” Tang Rou stood beside Mu Chen as she introduced them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qiu Shan is the name of the person that spoke out. The one on his left is Bei Mo, while the one on his right is Lan Hai.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They were originally independent cultivators, but had offended a sect and were hunted by them. They were fortunate to be saved by us and joined the Nine Nether Troop. For all of these years, they have been loyal and never left despite the high price offered by the Blood Hawk Hall.” Tang Bing explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head, joining the Nine Nether Troop was a pretty good outcome for ordinary independent cultivators. At the very least, they could receive free Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. But Mu Chen was a little startled that they could resist the bribery from the Blood Hawk Hall.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like these three know how to be grateful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want the Nine Nether Troop to be yours, you’ll have to depend on yourself next.” Tang Bing said softly. She could forcefully get the Nine Nether Troop to follow orders but the Nine Nether Troop would definitely be unsatisfied that way, and birth other thoughts in their hearts. Thus, it was up to Mu Chen to try and tame those untamable horses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he took a step forth, his figure flashed and appeared within the Training Field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys will not obey me?” Mu Chen looked at the three figures that stood at the front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three did not speak, but there wasn’t any respect in the gazes that they threw over. They saw through Mu Chen’s strength, he was a First Grade Sovereign. Perhaps he might be a little stronger than them, but it was far from enough for them to be convinced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come together, at least let me know if you guys have the qualifications to express your unwillingness.” Mu Chen spoke with a calm voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rage rose from the eyes of the three men as one of them said in a heavy voice, “We have yet to refine our Sovereign Celestial Bodies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meaning behind their words was that it was impossible for them to be convinced if Mu Chen was trying to suppress them with his Sovereign Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will not be using it.” Mu Chen said in a calm manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes of the three men grew sharp. There wasn’t any hesitation when the three of them took a step forth, mysteriously appearing around Mu Chen. Their palms were like lightning, targeted Mu Chen’s vitals. The three of them displayed their tacit understandings from their cooperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boundless Spiritual Energies rumbled like thunder beneath the three men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure did not move as he abruptly clenched his fist. His skin was swiftly turning silver as deep roars of thunder rumbled from his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not move when facing the swift attacks of the three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The palms of those three heavily landed against Mu Chen as astonishingly violent Spiritual Energies exploded. The earth beneath instantly crumbled and cracked, creating a large ravine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Visible ripples could be seen on the surface of Mu Chen’s body, his figure as brilliant as silver. Even his pupils had turned silver with lightning flowing on the surface of his body, making him look like a lightning god that had descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of the Qiu Shan trio couldn't help changing as they felt that beneath their palms, it was like a boulder that had been refined by lightning time and time again, being indestructible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a powerful physical body!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of those three flashed with shock. They had refined their physical bodies in the past. But compared to Mu Chen’s, the gap was simply too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lightning exploded from Mu Chen’s silver pupils, rays of lighting spread out as a force of dreadful Spiritual Energy wreaked havoc. The bodies of the Qiu Shan trio jolted as they flew back in a miserable manner, leaving behind deep marks on the ground beneath their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep whispers came from the Nine Nether Palace in an instant as well. Many people had shock in their eyes, since they didn’t expect that the cooperation between the Qiu Shan trio couldn’t even move the youth before them in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How formidable.” Tang Rou exclaimed with her eyes filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing lightly nodded her head as she looked at the slender figure standing before the Nine Nether Troop. That figure seemed to possess a heart-shocking manner that made it hard for others to shift their gazes away.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That youth seems to possess a unique charm, no wonder Big Sister Nine Nether regards him with great importance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come again if you guys are still unconvinced.” Mu Chen’s eyes were indifferent as he stared at the trio.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The trio bitterly smiled upon hearing Mu Chen’s words and they shook their heads in dejection. The gap was too great. They couldn’t do a thing to Mu Chen’s physical body, even with the three of them together. This fight wasn’t on the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at their reactions, the silver light on the surface of Mu Chen’s body gradually faded away. As the silver light faded, the lightning runes on his chest beneath his clothes were also silently fading away. Counting them, there were actually ten runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, Mu Chen had achieved great success with his Lightning God’s Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s no wonder why he dared to withstand an attack of those three with the strength of his physical body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Mu Chen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The trio took a step back as they called out in deep voices with their hands cupped together. Under Mu Chen’s strength, they had no other choice but to be convinced.</span></p>
