 <p><strong>Chapter 459 - Qiu Beihai</strong></p>
 <p>As Mu Chen and his group neared the combat zone, they slowly came to a stop. Looking towards the youth whose face was contorted upon their appearance, a smile brimming with chilling intent surfaced on Mu Chen’s face as she said, “Qiu Beihai, we finally meet again.”</p>
 <p>The dark-faced Qiu Beihai stared with daggers drawn towards Mu Chen and Luo Li. After quite a while, he spoke out with a dark tone. “Mu Chen, I truly never imagined that you, who had been kicked out halfway in the Spiritual Road, would actually still be able to enter one of the five Great Academies. You truly are formidable.”</p>
 <p>“However…”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, a cold sneer rose from the corner of Qiu Beihai’s mouth as he looked with an amused fashion at Mu Chen as he continued speaking, “It seems that you’ve fallen behind. Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase, huh. Haha! You still dare to enter the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament with that level of strength? You’re not afraid that your renowned title of the Blood Calamity of the Spiritual Road would bring an overflowing amount of great disasters for you?”</p>
 <p>“As of now, Ji Xuan has already far surpassed you. If you are to bump into him, hehe…”</p>
 <p>After a previous bout of being overwhelmed with shock, Qiu Beihai clearly noticed Mu Chen’s current level of strength, causing that fear and shock to gradually dissipate away. What replaced it was a feeling of happiness. <em>Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase? Ha Ha!</em> As of now, the Blood Calamity that had caused him to feel incredibly threatened in the Spiritual Road had fallen to such a degree.</p>
 <p>A faint frosty intent radiated from Luo Li’s beautiful eyes as she spoke out, “Qiu Beihai, looks like you don’t want to keep your remaining finger, right?”</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Qiu Beihai’s face instantly contorted as he grounded and clenched his teeth towards Luo Li, his hands being tightly clenched. Both of his hands had one finger missing, being chopped of by her during the Spiritual Road when he had brought along people to surround her. Ever since then, this had always been the pain in his heart. However, his possessed some dread and fear towards the latter. From his senses, he could tell that the current Luo Li had clearly passed her Human Body Disaster, making her cultivation not one bit weaker than him.</p>
 <p>Suppressing the anger and fury in his heart, Qiu Beihai gave a sneer before replying. “I’ve heard that your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy has only sent two groups this time around? Haha! Looks like the title of being one of the five Great Academies will be stripped of your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy after this Great Spiritual Academy Tournament. I can’t be bothered to deal with you guys. Bring your people and scram off. Mu Chen, if I were you, I’d be smart enough to find a place and hide so as to not bump into Ji Xuan. If not, you’ll be totally smashed up and beaten by him. At this moment, your great title of being the Blood Calamity of the Spiritual Road has been completely thrown into oblivion.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?!” Upon hearing his words, the faces of Xu Huang and the other two instantly contorted as they furiously roared out in reply.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you understand what I’ve just said?”</p>
 <p>With a sneer, Qiu Beihai waved his hands, causing his four group members to converge around him. Of the four, one of them slowly walked forward, standing beside the former as he shot a ridiculing gaze towards Mu Chen’s group.</p>
 <p>“You’re only a group with one Human Body Disaster member in it. Haha. Indeed, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s unable to make the cut anymore.” The youth that appeared to be older than Qiu Beihai, crossed his arms in front of his chest as he let of a mocking laugh. In the next instant, boundless Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiated from his body. From the looks of it, his strength appeared to be on the same level as Qiu Beihai, having passed his Human Body Disaster as well.</p>
 <p>In their group, there were two people that had passed their Human Body Disaster, with the other three being of Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase. From their outward appearance, their line-up seemed to be stronger than that of Mu Chen’s group.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they still had an alliance with three other groups. Although the three other groups weren’t as strong as them, every single one of them possessed a person who had passed their Human Body Disaster. Although they might split up their forces to deal with the group from the Desolation Spiritual Academy, their remaining forces would absolutely deal with and cause the group from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to lose all temper at all.</p>
 <p>None of them believed that this group from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy would dare to have the heart to take any action under the suppression of their line-up.</p>
 <p>At the back, the group from the Desolation Spiritual Academy being surrounded by the three groups could also feel the confrontation occurring over there. In the next moment, one of the groups peeled away, with their Captain, sizing up Mu Chen’s group with a smile on his face that brimmed with provocation. Turning his gaze to Luo Li, his eyes started to wander around her alluring body as he whistled with a grin, before speaking out, “I truly never imagined that there would be such a beautiful girl in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. I truly can’t find such quality in our Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy.”</p>
 <p>“Haha. Brother Beihai, do you still need help?” asked the youth as he looked towards Qiu Beihai with a grin. At the same time, Spiritual Energy fluctuations started to perfuse from his body. Unexpectedly, he was also an expert that had passed his Human Body Disaster.</p>
 <p>The two teams stood right before Mu Chen’s group, staring covetously at them like two ferocious tigers.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the faces of Xu Huang and the other two slightly changed. If it was a one-on-one, they weren’t afraid to face off against a group like the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy, However, with the appearance of the group from the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy, such a line-up was sufficient to change the entire situation.</p>
 <p>“It’s just a slight trouble,” replied Qiu Beihai with a smile, before looking towards Mu Chen in satisfaction. This was an opponent that had once made him feel immense pressure. However, at this very moment, thinking back about the times where he was being totally suppressed, he could not help feeling true pity for the latter.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, I advise you to tactfully leave. I don’t have the heart to deal with you now. Don’t ask for trouble,” said Qiu Beihai in an indifferent tone as he waved his hands.</p>
 <p>Seeing the appearance of Qiu Beihai waving his hands in indifference, Mu Chen could not help bursting into laughter. Tilting his head towards Luo Li, he asked her with a smile. “How should we split?”</p>
 <p>“Leave to group from the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy to me,” replied Luo Li with a sweet smile.</p>
 <p>“The whole group?” Hearing her reply, Mu Chen’s eyebrows were faintly raised.</p>
 <p>“You don’t believe me?” Luo Li shot a glance at Mu Chen. Waving the Luo Shen Sword in her hand, she sweetly smiled while saying, “If we’re to cross hands, you might not even be able to win against me.”</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Mu Chen smiled and nodded his head, saying, “Leave the two Human Body Disaster fellows from the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy to me. As for the other three people, deal with them, Xu Huang, Fengyang and Qingshan. That shouldn’t be a problem, right?”</p>
 <p>After all, they were a group. Therefore, he can’t let Xu Huang and the other two sit on the side as he took action.</p>
 <p>“No problem!” Xu Huang and the other two nodded without the slightest hesitation. Other than Qiu Beihai and the other Human Body Disaster expert in the group from the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy, the remaining three were at Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase, which was on the same level as Xu Huang and the other two. Thus, they would naturally not have any dread or fear in facing them.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, do not ignore my kindness!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Mu Chen had actually chose to completely ignore him and even went so far as to distribute their targets, Qiu Beihai’s face instantly turned slightly ashen as he roared out in a chilly voice.</p>
 <p>‘Haha, you truly are rampant, little girl. Do you really think that you’ll be able to deal with our entire group by yourself?” the Group Captain from the Great Cauldron Spiritual ACademy gave an insincere smile towards Luo Li. Although the former had passed her Human Body Disaster, wanting to deal with his entire group was her indulging too much in fantasy.</p>
 <p>Within the skies, there were also the numerous groups present that were watching the commotion that was taking place. Furthermore, upon seeing that the group from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was actually wanting to deal with two groups by themselves, all of them felt shock and astonishment. Within the ranks of this Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, they had only one person that had passed her Human Body Disaster. With such a line-up, they still dared to confront the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy and the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy at the same time?</p>
 <p>At the rear, upon discovering this scene, the two groups surrounding the Desolation Spiritual Academy immediately slowed down their assault slightly. Being able to enter the Top 16 and last for a day under their encirclement, this group from the Desolation Spiritual Academy truly possessed considerable strength. Only with the encirclement by their three groups, with the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy keeping watch at the back, were they able to suppress the group from the Desolation Spiritual Academy. However, from the looks of it now, with both the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy and the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy having left to deal with the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, they could barely suppress the Desolation Spiritual Academy with the strength of their two groups. Compared to the situation before, they wouldn’t pose much of a threat now.</p>
 <p>Seemingly discovering the change in the situation, the group from the Desolation Spiritual Academy quietly took a breath of relief. If the previous situation had continued on, they might not have been able to last much longer.</p>
 <p>The Group Captain from the Desolation Spiritual Academy was a somewhat burly-built youth. Looking towards the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s confrontation with the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy not far from him, a faint flash sparkled within his eyes. As of now, the situation they were currently in was extremely unfavorable for them. If the three groups were to let the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy join hands and go on the offensive against their group, the result would be extremely worrying for his group. However, at this very moment, they had no other method to hope that the group from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy would truly be able to obstruct the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy, as well as the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy. This way, they might be able to obtain a chance to…</p>
 <p>Looking towards the somewhat ashen Qiu Beihai, Mu Chen smiled and shook his head. Slowing walking forward as he looked towards the slight wave of the former’s hand, the smile at the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth gradually appeared cold and fierce.</p>
 <p>“Qiu Beihai, I’ve never been eye-to-eye with you before in the Spiritual Road, and it's the same in this place.”</p>
 <p>“In my eyes, you don’t have the qualifications to jump and hop around in front of me.”</p>
 <p>The veins on Qiu Beihai’s face twitched and quivered while his gaze slowly turned malevolent. “Okay. Let me see exactly who’s the one with no qualifications to jump and hop around!”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qui Beihai’s robes fluttered as boundless Spiritual Energy swept out from him. In the next instant, his gaze turned cold and sinister as he roared, “Kill them!”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At the instant when his roar rang out, he had already shot forward. Clenching his hand tightly, a scarlet-red longsword appeared from within, while a fierce sword aura rushed towards the sky.</p>
 <p>Behind him, the face of the other Human Body Disaster expert from the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy turned frosty as he also shot forward. One left, one right, rushing towards Mu Chen just like two hawks.</p>
 <p>“Come, little girl. Let me see how you’re gonna deal with our group by yourself!” sneered the Captain of the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy group as he viciously stared at Luo Li.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>What replied to him was a swift and fierce Sword Aura in the shape of a silvery river. Splitting the skies apart, the chilling intent brought by it caused his face to instantly contort. With the clench of his hand, a black metal shield sparkling with spiritual light appeared right before him.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Piercing explosively towards the metal shield, rays of brilliance sparkled from the Sword Aura as deep slash marks appeared on its surface.</p>
 <p>Seeing the deep slash marks on the surface of his metal shield, the eyelids of the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy Group Captain furiously twitched. However, before he could regain his senses, a beautiful figure had already shot and appeared right before him like a spectre. As sword shadows shot out, they heavily impacted on the surface of his metal shield.</p>
 <p>Puff!</p>
 <p>That was a Spiritual Weapon that possessed an extremely powerful defense. However, under those sword shadows, they appeared to be as weak as tofu. As the sword shadows shot out, they had unexpectedly pierced through the metal shield. The sharp tip of the sword came to a stop an inch before the forehead of the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy Captain, with the Sword Aura radiating off of it, causing a drop of blood to drip down from the centre of his brows.</p>
 <p>Finally, his face furiously contorted as dread and fear flashed within his eyes as he furiously roared out. “Move!”</p>
 <p>Immediately, the group from the Great Cauldron Spiritual Academy shot out from behind him, launching a powerful assault that encompassed the beautiful figure before them.</p>
