Only the one on the most right still had ripples of dreadful Spiritual Energy fluctuations, causing signs of faint distortion in the space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Battle Stage between Xue Tianhe and Wu Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The team members of those two teams had their own victories and losses as according to the calculation of points, the two teams only had two points each. Which meant that two of their teammates in each team obtained a victory while having one tied; both of the teams had the same amount of points. Thus, the battle between their Captains would determine if they could get into the Best 4.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Xue Tianhe is truly formidable, to be capable of fighting with Wu Ling to such a degree.” Shen Cangsheng and the rest had astonishment revealed on their expressions. Wu Ling was the most prominent genius in the Martial Spiritual Academy. Due to the fact that he had been hiding his strength in the Elimination Round, he had yet to show his true strength. But even so, he still couldn’t defeat Xue Tianhe so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xue Tianhe is a Prince in the Blood God Clan, his background would only be stronger compared to Wu Ling, not weaker.” Luo Li spoke in a soft tone. She naturally had a good understanding of the Blood God Clan. Although Wu Ling was the grandson of the Martial Spiritual Academy’s Dean, the foundation of an academy was still inferior to the Blood God Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t tell who will win, as well.” Mu Chen nodded his head in agreement. In terms of relationship, he still wished for Wu Ling to emerge victorious. After all, he didn’t have the slightest favourable opinion of Xue Tianhe, since he hopes to personally slaughter this fellow who had ill intentions for Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This battle will be extremely intense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone heard that statement, they nodded their heads in agreement as they looked at the colossal Battle Stage without batting an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this vast region, every single person had their attention gathered upon that Battle Stage at this moment, especially students of the Martial Spiritual Academy; all of them had nervous expressions on their faces. Right now, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Saint Spiritual Academy and the Myriad Phoenix Spiritual Academy had entered the Best 4, if their Martial Spiritual Academy were to fail here, it would definitely be a considerable impact to their morale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the innumerable gazes, two surges of boundless Spiritual Energy were frantically clashing in the colossal Battle Stage, separated by the colours of blood-red and deep yellow, splitting the stage into two regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Tianhe and Wu Ling’s figures were practically engulfed by the boundless Spiritual Energies with only thunderous explosions sounding off every time the two surges of dreadful Spiritual Energy clashed. Judging from the Spiritual Energy impacts, the battle between the two had already reached the climax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the two surges of Spiritual Energies clashed, a violence-filled roar resounded from the Battle Stage. That roar didn’t seem to be something that could be produced by humans, it sounded like an ape’s roar. The roar was filled with endless ferocity as the sound waves spread out, pushing the blood-red Spiritual Energy back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That scene instantly caused an endless uproar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Luo Li’s gazes also narrowed in an instant, shifting their gazes over, they saw the sudden appearance of a large silhouette in the boundlessly deep yellow-coloured Spiritual Energy. It was an image of about a few hundred meters, it seemed to be a deep yellow-coloured ape. The ape was holding onto a huge black pole with a savage expression, its eyes were also filled with ferocity and thirst for battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the gigantic ape made its appearance, the Spiritual Energy between the heavens and earth started to boil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could not help having his expression changed as he exclaimed in surprise, “Rank 15 of the Myriad Beast Record’s Earth Rank, the Divine War Ape?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By his side, Luo Li also revealed an astonished expression as she clearly never expected Wu Ling to have previously refined the Soul Essence of a Divine War Ape. It looked like the Martial Spiritual Academy was related to this as well; otherwise, how could Wu Ling refine such a powerful Spiritual Beast’s Soul Essence with his own strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How dreadful, so Wu Ling had concealed such a trump card under his sleeve.” Shen Cangsheng and the rest also exclaimed in surprise, which was shortly replaced by envy. Such a powerful Spiritual Beast’s Soul Essence wasn’t something an ordinary people could enjoy. Not only did one require great opportunity, it also required the aid of powerful experts. Otherwise, that person would only be counter-devoured by the Soul Essence instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although all of them had refined Soul Essences back when they were in the Spirit Stage, their Spiritual Beast’s Soul Essences weren’t powerful. Thus, as they got stronger, the power of the Soul Essence would also slowly fade and would no longer be usable, unless they refined the Soul Essence of a powerful Spiritual Beast of the Myriad Beast Record back when they were in the Spirit Stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xue Tianhe is not going to last.” Li Xuantong looked at the stage. When Wu Ling revealed his trump card, the stalemate between them was instantly shattered. The torrential blood-red Spiritual Energy was being pushed back and, clearly, according to this situation, Wu Ling would probably win the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not that simple.” Luo Li, however, shook her head in disagreement as her eyes fixed onto that silhouette covered in blood-red Spiritual Energy as a chill flashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also closely watching the Battle Stage since he also wished to know what else Xue Tianhe had hidden under his sleeve. Facing the currently powerful Wu Ling, can he win?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes, the large ape that Wu Ling had taken the form of waved its large pole, sweeping away an earth-shatteringly large amount of blood-red Spiritual Energy. Thereafter, Wu Ling drove his pole forth along with a windstorm towards the silhouette hidden in the blood-red Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Creak! Creak!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The boundless oceanic blood-red Spiritual Energy was suppressed until it was only to tens of meters. Furthermore, that Spiritual Energy was also shattered under the whirlwind of the pole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, just when the pole was about to completely shatter the blood-red Spiritual Energy, an unforeseen event occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Under the impact of the two terrifying powers, cracks started to spread on the ground below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the whirlwind from the impact wreaked havoc, everyone was shocked as they witnessed Wu Ling, who was currently in the form of a colossal ape, being pushed back, leaving deep footprint grooves on the ground.</span></p>

Earlier, when that huge fist covered in blood-red scales appeared, he could sense the movement coming from the black egg, which was the current form of the Nine Netherbird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Xue Tianhe has also refined a powerful Spiritual Beast’s Soul Essence?”</span></p>

The appearance was very ferocious as a surge of savage aura was being emitted as it spread throughout the heavens and the earth.</span></p>

It was said that the Demonic Blood Beast was a species of extreme savagery, ranking in 13 and was only two ranks beneath the Nine Netherbird. From that point alone, one could deduct how powerful the Demonic Blood Beast was, but due to the fact of the beast possessing an extremely savage nature, it would affect the one that refined it, planting a savage nature into that person.</span></p>

The Blood Sea was made by the Blood God Clan from sacrificing the Blood Essence of countless people. Through it, they reached an agreement to beneficially strengthen both their clans.” At this moment, Luo Li’s clear pupils were filled with extreme hatred.</span></p>

No wonder the Luo God Clan was filled with hatred for the Blood God Clan.</span></p>

The responsibilities on her shoulders had far surpassed his expectations. She had hundreds of millions of people to protect and she could only leave the Luo God Clan for two years to be at the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Her sacrifices made Mu Chen feel his heart being plugged.</span></p>

Indeed, the battle in the Battle Stage was overturned, along with Xue Tianhe activating the power of the Demonic Blood Beast, his strength had surpassed Wu Ling at this point.

He gave a mocking glance at Wu Ling, he tugged his arms to his chest as he swept his gaze out and in the end, fixed his gaze onto Mu Chen and Luo Li. A savage smile rose up from the corner of his lips.</span></p>
