 <p><strong>Chapter 370 - Spiritual Array Competition with Wu Jia</strong></p>
 <p>As Mu Chen walked out, not only did it cause countless clamoring noises to ring out within the Western Desolated City, it also caused the expression of the indifferent-looking Wu Jia to faintly tremble as his dark and cold gaze locked onto the former.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, Mu Chen cast a blind eye towards all those gazes. Shooting out, he slowly came to a stop a couple hundred metres away from Wu Jia. Cupping his fists, he spoke out with a faint smile. “Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Freshman Mu Chen, came forward to seek guidance.”</p>
 <p>“This fellow…truly is only a Freshman…” Mu Chen’s words instantly caused shocked and astonished cries to ring out, before everyone turned and looked at each other. This batch of Freshmen from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was actually that tyrannical? Having just arrived in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, they actually dared to act so rampant in the Northern Heavens Continent?</p>
 <p>Wu Jia stared straight at Mu Chen, while not much of the so-called disdain and contempt was present. He knew that the so-called “Freshman” before him was, in fact, not a simple character. If not, Chi Yu and Mao Jiong wouldn’t have lost their lives in his hands.</p>
 <p>The reason why the current situation would progress to such a stage was all due to the youth in front of him that had appeared out of thin air… If not for him suddenly breaking through their blockade to find Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, and even dispelling the Demonic Dragon Poison within their bodies, the people locked within those metal cages might not only be Lin Zheng and the other two.</p>
 <p>If not for this youth, this four-on-four battle would not exist, and the only thing they needed to do was to carefreely enjoy the process of stomping on the face of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Shooting a deep look at Mu Chen, Spiritual Energy started to ripple around Wu Jia’s body, appearing as if he was standing within a surging lake.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>In the far distance, boundless Spiritual Energy erupted akin to a storm from Shen Cangsheng. Hoisting his Golden Lotus War God Spear, a chilling glow erupted from his eyes as he shot forward. Shadow spears blotted the skies, bringing forth frightening Spiritual Energy as they surrounded Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Shen Cangsheng! Since you truly want to have a fight with me, I’ll grant your wish today!”</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi raised his head with a long arrogant roar filled with laughter. Greyish-black Spiritual Energy erupted from him, before transforming into demonic dragons, twisting and twining around him. At this moment, the sky started to turn dark and gloomy.</p>
 <p>“This time, I’ll let you know, the true disparity between us!”</p>
 <p>With a clench of his fist, two demonic dragons condensed within his hand. Grabbing them, he shot out, clashing head-on against the incoming Shen Cangsheng without a hint of retreat.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Incomparably erratic Spiritual Energy swept out as the two men confronted each other in the air. Under the shock waves produced by their attacks, even the cloud layers in the sky were completely separated.</p>
 <p>Their fight was astonishing and soul-stirring.</p>
 <p>After seeing Shen Cangsheng commencing the fight, Luo Li and Li Xuantong didn’t continue hesitating and swiftly rushed out towards their respective enemies. Upon launching their attacks, they didn’t do any such thing as warming up, since what they needed the most now was time.</p>
 <p>They needed to defeat their enemies before Shen Cangsheng fell!</p>
 <p>Only when that happened would they be able to reverse the situation before them around.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Within the endless confines of the horizon, three fights instantly took place. Boundless Spiritual Energy rippled and swept out, seemingly filling the entire sky above the Western Desolated City, causing shocked expressions to fill the faces of countless people.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase. People of this strength could already be considered as top ranking within the entire Northern Heavens Continent. There were even some powers and influences who were completely led by characters of this level of strength. Therefore, the confrontation happening in the sky was clearly extremely spectacular to the people in the city.</p>
 <p>Feeling the Spiritual Energy storms sweeping out within the horizon, Mu Chen took a deep breath of air, before his black eyes gradually turned frosty. Locking his gaze on Wu Jia, Spiritual Energy burning with black flames rose from his body.</p>
 <p>Humm.</p>
 <p>An apathetic expression still remained on Wu Jia’s face and not a single word was spoken from him. With a formation of a hand seal, the air around his body started to churn and flare up. As rays of brilliance radiated out, two gigantic Spiritual Arrays immediately surfaced behind his back.</p>
 <p>Obviously, he had long-made his preparations.</p>
 <p>Those two gigantic Spiritual Arrays started to rapidly revolve as they radiated with overbearing Spiritual Energy fluctuations. Those were two Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays. However, they were arranged by Wu Jia with a casual move of his hands. Him being a Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master was not an unjustified reputation.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As the two Spiritual Arrays revolved, boundless Spiritual Energy condensed forth, before transforming into two large Spiritual Energy-made hands. Shooting out explosively, they immediately patted furiously down towards Mu Chen’s location.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen raised his head, his black pupils reflecting the image of the large Spiritual Energy-made hands head towards him. With the formation of a hand seal, rays of brilliance erupted out from the air behind him, before two gigantic Spiritual Arrays surfaced.</p>
 <p>As the two Spiritual Arrays appeared behind Mu Chen, clamoring noises seemed to ring out within the entire city.</p>
 <p>“That Mu Chen’s actually a Spiritual Array Master?!”</p>
 <p>“No wonder why he was so confident. However, he can’t possibly have greater attainments than Wu Jia on the aspect of Spiritual Arrays, right?”</p>
 <p>“That’s hard to say. Since this time, it’s a battle between Spiritual Array Masters, there’ll be quite a good show to watch…”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen didn’t give the slightest care towards those countless whispers of discussions floating in the air. With a flick of his finger, golden lights erupted from the two Spiritual Arrays at his back. In the next instant, two gigantic golden teeth wheels explosively shot out. Carving two lines across the horizon, they smashed head-on against the descending giant Spiritual Energy-made hands.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Spiritual Energy instantly exploded outwards as both attacks gradually dissolved in mutual destruction.</p>
 <p>“So, you’re a Spiritual Array Master.”</p>
 <p>Traces of emotion finally appeared within Wu Jia’s eyes.</p>
 <p>In response, Mu Chen sent a smile back at him, brimming with chilling intent. In the next instant, he shot out, boundless Spiritual Energy was condensing on his fists. Being a Spiritual Array Master, he naturally knew that one should never give too much time for a Spiritual Array Master to prepare when faced against one.</p>
 <p>Seeing Mu Chen rushing straight towards him, Wu Jia had similarly sensed the intent of the former. Displaying a faint smile, he spoke out, “If you’re thinking you’re able to impede a Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master just like that, you’re truly looking down on me.”</p>
 <p>With a wave of his sleeve, more Spiritual Arrays started taking form behind him, with all of them being Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays. However, they were all arranged by a casual flick of his hand.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Erratic Spiritual Energy erupted from each of the Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays, before violently rumbling towards Mu Chen. However, facing against attacks of such degrees, not the slightest change was present on his expression before black lightning arcs appeared on his body, completely eradicating the incoming attacks.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Wu Jia’s attacks exploded on Mu Chen’s body as he pierced through the barrage of erratic Spiritual Energy without a single scratch appearing on his body. Within the toughness of his fleshly body, those Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays simply weren't a threat to him.</p>
 <p>“You’ve actually refined your physique…”</p>
 <p>Looking at Mu Chen, who had shot through all the attacks he had launched, Wu Jia’s eyes slightly narrowed, before shaking his head. Looks like Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays simply weren’t able to obstruct that Mu Chen the slightest bit.</p>
 <p>With a clench of his hand, a golden metallic ball covered in abstruse runic patterns appeared within. With a flick, it shot out, before a thousand rays of brilliance blossomed from it.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, that was a Spiritual Array Seed!</p>
 <p>As the golden light erupted, it instantly transformed into an incomparably gigantic Spiritual Array. Spiritual Energy crazily condensed within the centre of the Spiritual Array, before finally transforming into a gigantic golden clock. Upon its complete formation, humming sounds instantly enveloped Mu Chen within it.</p>
 <p>Radiating with powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations, this golden clock was much more tyrannical that those Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays that were arranged earlier by him. Obviously, this golden clock had already encroached on the boundary of a Rank 5 Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>Just as the golden clock had enveloped Mu Chen, intense vibrations started to spread through it. Clear and melodious ringing sounds continued to spread from it, while getting more hurried one after the other. Obviously, Mu Chen, who was within it, was rapidly breaking the array that had surrounded him.</p>
 <p>An indifferent expression still filled Wu Jia’s face as his figure fluttered back. His hands came together to form a seal, and Spiritual Seals started to sparkle akin to stars in a night sky as they condensed at an astonishing speed.</p>
 <p>This number had already arrived in the hundreds. Obviously, this Wu Jia had finally prepared to use his true killing move.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Hundreds of Spiritual Seals explosively shot out, before fusing together in the air. In the next instant, everyone within the city was able to something akin to a storm taking shape within this stretch of the sky.</p>
 <p>Grave expressions filled the faces of countless people within the entire city as they were able to feel how formidable the Spiritual Array being arranged by Wu Jia this time was. This was definitely considered to be a rather strong one within all the Rank 5 Spiritual Arrays.</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom!</p>
 <p>Crack after crack started to appear and extend over the surface of the giant golden clock. With a finally bang, an arm encased in black lightning shot out from within. In the next instant, the entire giant clock completely exploded apart, transforming into glowing dots that blotted sky, before dissipating into thin air.</p>
 <p>After smashing the giant golden clock apart, Mu Chen raised his head to look at the sky, which had already turned dim and dark. A gigantic Spiritual Array, approximately a few hundred feet wide, was spread across the sky, enveloping around him.</p>
 <p>“This Spiritual Array…”</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen looked at the gigantic Spiritual Array, his eyes faintly contracted, since he could discover some dangerous fluctuations emanating from it.</p>
 <p>As boundless Spiritual Energy howled from it, the stretch of the sky that Mu Chen was in appeared as if it had been disconnected from the world. At the same time, all of the gazes within the entire city were blocked from seeing it. In everyone’s eyes, they could only see an incomparably gigantic Spiritual Array, while being unable to see the two people that were confronting each other within it.</p>
 <p>However, although they were unable to see within it, everyone one knew that it would be the determining moment for the victor and loser when either one of the two walked out from the Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>As the Spiritual Energy light screen surrounded him, Mu Chen looked into the distance, to the place where Wu Jia was seated in the air. The latter’s chest was faintly heaving, while a grave expression filled his eyes. Obviously, arranging such a large array had led to quite a large consumption of his strength.</p>
 <p>“Till this point in time, my Nine Layered Mountain and River Array has already trapped thirteen Heavenly Completion Stage experts within it to death…”</p>
 <p>With malevolent and chilling intent like a venomous snake, Wu Jia stared at Mu Chen, while the smile present at the corner of his mouth appeared exceptionally eerie and sinister. Speaking out, he said, “You can be sufficiently proud of yourself for being able to force me to bring it out with your Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase…”</p>
 <p>“However… your outcome will be no different from those thirteen people.”</p>
 <p>As his voice rang out, his hands abruptly came together to form a seal. In the next instant, the incomparably gigantic Spiritual Array erupted with dazzling brightness, transforming this place into something akin to a small world. Within the small world of the Spiritual Array were nine mountains glowing with golden light, appearing akin to nine divine mountains. Bright and resplendent golden brilliance slowly appeared as they radiated from the nine mountains.</p>
 <p>At the same time, frightening Spiritual Energy pressure started to pervade out.</p>
 <p>Seeing the nine mountains and feeling the incoming pressure, Mu Chen’s expression started to slowly turn solemn.</p>
