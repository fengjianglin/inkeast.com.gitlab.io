 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they heard that large sum, even Lin Ming’s vicious face had frozen and the Heavenly Evil King’s face had become dark. Clearly, they were also startled by that amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets was basically all they had over the past few months. If they really lost 400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets, then they could just give up on the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one expected Mu Chen’s so-called “going bigger” would actually mean this, that was practically the same as pushing people onto the path of no return!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in this region was dumbfounded as they looked at the calm youth who had coldness in his eyes. At the same time, they couldn’t help feeling the palpitation in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Palace initially wanted to dig a hole and bury the Great Havenlaw Domain in it. They even thought of several plans, but they did not expect Mu Chen to be so insane and confront them with no way out, pulling the Netherworld Palace into the hole as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his actions, the Netherworld Palace was the one being tricked now. If they did not even have the nerve to go along with Mu Chen, then it would be unavoidable for them to be a laughing stock, buried in the hole that they’d dug and cause a great amount of damage to their reputation. In the Northern Region, peak forces paid great attention to their reputation. That’s because that was something for them to recruit people. The moment their reputation had gone bad, then it would be hard for experts to willingly join them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen, are you insane?!” Lin Ming gritted his teeth. Although he was confident that he wasn’t any weaker than Mu Chen, 400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets was practically all they had. If anything went wrong, then it would probably enrage the Netherworld Palace’s Palace Master to the point that he’d turn him into ashes with a slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen narrowed his eyes as he spoke in a voice that held ridicule in his tone, “Why? Isn’t it your Netherworld Palace that likes to play? Now that I’m suggesting for us to play a bigger game, you guys became cowards?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s face was pale as his gaze violently flickered. His gaze, which was staring at Mu Chen, looked like he wanted to devour Mu Chen whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this region, the Divine Pavilion, Myriad Saint Peak and the other peak forces were astonished as they watched this development. Especially after seeing Mu Chen’s calm gaze, their hearts couldn’t help jolting. Although Mu Chen was young, his decisiveness wasn’t any weaker from that of a cunning old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Mu Chen’s insanity at this moment, even the other peak forces couldn’t help being a little fearful. Vaguely, they were slightly rejoicing at the fact that it wasn’t directed at them. Otherwise, 400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets would be enough to make any of them tremble in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t dare to take up the challenge, then release the Glacier King and get lost.” Mu Chen looked at Lin Ming and the higher hierarchy of the Netherworld Palace, whose faces were pale, and continued in a cold sneer, “The Netherworld Palace is just bunch of incapable fools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he shifted his gaze towards Lin Ming again. “You must be fated if you’re delusional enough to be wanting to soar into the sky. Otherwise, you’re just seeking humiliation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s eyes were practically covered in veins as he fixed his gaze at Mu Chen, before a vicious smile rose on the corner of his lips. “Mu Chen, looks like you’re truly courting death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since that’s the case, then I will fulfil your wish today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming abruptly took a step forth and his cold tone became filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the higher hierarchy of the Netherworld Palace saw that Lin Ming actually agreed to Mu Chen’s challenge, their faces couldn’t help changing. Although Lin Ming did not have a single loss so far, the concern of this matter was too great. If anything went wrong, then none of them could take up this responsibility!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Evil King and the Netherworld Prince exchanged a glance. They were both enraged by Mu Chen. Furthermore, they were clear that their Netherworld Palace had been forced on a path with no retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This matter was started by them, but facing the Great Havenlaw Domain’s counterattack, if they were to cower and this matter was to spread out, then their Netherworld Palace would become a laughing stock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that point in time, their Netherworld Palace’s Palace Master would be enraged as well. If the Palace Master was to look into this matter, not a single one of them could escape from it. Therefore, after much pondering, their only way available to them was to accept the challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the Great Havenlaw Domain was also taking a great risk as well. If Mu Chen lost the challenge, then the Great Havenlaw Domain would be completely ruined by him and they’d return from this Hunting War empty-handed, which would risk facing destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the great risk in this challenge, the harvest was also extremely tempting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, their only concern right now was that who, between Mu Chen and Lin Ming, had a higher chance of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although Mu Chen has defeated Xiao Tian in the Death Ruin, Xiao Tian isn’t a Battle Formation Master, so there’s nothing to compare…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for Zhantai Liuli, she wasn’t a Battle Formation Master back then as well, so Mu Chen could gain the upper hand from their battle. The current Lin Ming is someone that not even Zhantai Liuli was confident to beat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, Lin Ming’s inheritance was left behind by that infamous powerhouse from the ancient times…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince and the Heavenly Evil King exchanged a glance as they transmitted their voices. In the end, both of their eyes turned vicious because with so many factors, the chances of Lin Ming winning was higher than Mu Chen’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen thinks that because of the events at the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, he can belittle everyone. Then, today, let him understand that there is always someone better!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After making the decision in their hearts, the Heavenly Evil King and Netherworld Prince did not speak any further. The remaining experts of the Netherworld Palace also gradually calmed down after seeing that the two of them did not sound out any objections. If they really lost the battle, there’s still the two of them that could take up the blame…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, they also had the same idea as the two of them in their hearts. If Lin Ming could defeat Mu Chen, then it would be a great blow to the Great Havenlaw Domain. At that time, it would undoubtedly be a great merit. If the Netherworld Palace’s Palace Master was happy, then he would also reward them with all sorts of rare Divine Arts, Artifacts, Sovereign Spiritual Liquids and Elixirs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So then, let’s give it a gamble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts of the Netherworld Palace abruptly clenched their teeth and had no longer hesitated. At the same time, they also stopped some that attempted to sound their objections. Now that the matter today had progressed this far, it was impossible for them to obstruct anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Lin Ming, who stood before the Netherworld Palace, had also clearly felt the calming objections. Immediately, the blood veins in his eyes grew denser as he viciously looked at Mu Chen and eerily said, “Wait for when I defeat you. I’ll see how the Great Havenlaw Domain will deal with a trash like you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that time, you will die from being self-opinionation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’ll depend if you have the chance to witness it yourself.” Mu Chen lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s gaze was cold as he viciously smiled, before stomping his foot. Both of his hands joined together as a bark abruptly resounded, “Netherworld Troop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

It was no wonder why Lin Ming’s infamous name had spread so greatly recently. Based on this Battle Will, even a Sixth Grade Sovereign would have a hard time defeating him.</span></p>

He had taken the initiative to make a move and the ocean of Battle Will whistled behind him with a yell.

The blade was filled with runes and the surging Battle Will that came from it had torn through space.</span></p>
