 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant Huo Mei’er acted, Mu Chen had also pounced towards the escaping Fire Dragon Scorpion as a majestic Spiritual Energy fluctuation rippled out from his body. He wasn’t as strong as Huo Mei’er. Even when the Fire Dragon Scorpion was heavily injured and greatly weakened, it was still a tough fellow to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s speed was extremely swift. In addition to the fact that the Fire Dragon Scorpion had been gravely injured, it only took several breaths’ of time for him to catch up to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Realising that Mu Chen was chasing after it, the Fire Dragon Scorpion unleashed an enraged roar as ferocity surged once again in its eyes. It had probably recalled that Mu Chen was the culprit that had lured him here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, anger was still anger, in the end. The Fire Dragon Scorpion was well-aware of its current state, so it could only unleash a warning and did not launch any attacks at Mu Chen as it swiftly escaped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen followed closely behind like a pest as his gaze flickered and made an embracing gesture. The Great Meru Demonic Pillar appeared, along with a massive shadow, and mercilessly headed for the Fire Dragon Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A massive magma pillar of light spewed out from the ferocious-looking mouth of the Fire Dragon Scorpion, clashing with the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, and a terrifying violent fluctuation wreaked havoc as it spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Meru Demonic Pillar was sent flying away. Even Mu Chen was sent a thousand feet out with an uncontrollable smear of astonishment on his face. Only by personally experiencing it did he realise how terrifying the Fire Dragon Scorpion was. Not to mention that it was gravely injured at the moment, if it was in its top form, Mu Chen would probably be heavily injured after a single contact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ferocious light flashed in the Fire Dragon Scorpion’s eyes as it looked at Mu Chen, before continuing its escape. Clearly, it did not want to stay in this dangerous place because of an ant-like existence like Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the escaping Fire Dragon Scorpion, Mu Chen clenched his teeth and briefly hesitated, before a ferocious light surged in his eyes as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He heavily stomped his feet, then his figure flew out. This time, he was charging towards the head of the Fire Dragon Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Mu Chen’s multiple obstructions, the Fire Dragon Scorpion finally could not hold back its ferocious nature and unleashed an enraged roar. Magma flowed in its mouth as it tried to bite Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the huge mouth of magma, which was enveloping over, Mu Chen’s eyes flickered as he stomped his feet. Not only did he not retreat, he even charged straight into the mouth of the Fire Dragon Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python unleashed a shrieking howl in another location. A scarlet beam of light flashed like a fire blade that could slice through anything. It flashed across the remaining neck of the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fresh magma blood soared into the sky and the shrieking howl had stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er’s alluring figure appeared in the sky as she flicked her hand, shattering the python head that was flying up and a scarlet light that was roughly a foot in size came down and hovered before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Spiritual Fire Marrow of the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python. In the light that looked like flowing scarlet magma, a pure fire Spiritual Energy was contained within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er made a summoning gesture as she stored the Spiritual Fire Marrow. Thereafter, her face slightly changed and immediately turned her head in time to see the scene of Mu Chen being devoured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this scene, even with Huo Mei’er’s composure, she couldn’t help having a slight change in her expression with a smear of anxiety. Although she had a complicated relationship with Nine Nether, there wasn’t any grudges between them, just pure competitive spirit and a similarity between them. If Mu Chen died here because of her, then with Nine Nether’s character, she would definitely not let this go so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why she was so cold before was just that she wanted to see how capable the Commander that Nine Nether had brought back was. She never expected Mu Chen would be stupid enough to be eaten!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fool!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er clenched her teeth as her figure moved, swiftly making her way towards the Fire Dragon Scorpion. In her hands, a torrential Spiritual Energy fluctuation gathered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when Huo Mei’er was about to act, the massive figure of the Fire Dragon Scorpion violently trembled, before issuing painful howls from its throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er was briefly stunned, before her gaze focused on the mouth of the Fire Dragon Scorpion. A dazzling golden light was bursting out as an extremely violent fluctuation of Spiritual Energy exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lumps of magma that were similar blood were spewing from the ferocious mouth of the Fire Dragon Scorpion. It was so much so that even its strong scales had shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, there was a surge of violent energy exploding from within its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Fire Dragon Scorpion was in its tip-top form, it could naturally suppress the attack coming from inside. But right now, it was heavily injured, so it could only unleash violent roars as torrents of magma that were like fresh blood constantly poured out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er’s expression was stunned as she watched this scene. Shortly after, she understood what was going on and her brows were uncontrollably twitching as her expression turned grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a ruthless fellow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er had the strength of the Great Havenlaw Army’s Great Commander after all, so she could tell what Mu Chen’s intention was with a single glance. That fellow clearly understood that it wouldn’t be possible for him to kill the Fire Dragon Scorpion by being reckless. So even if he managed to force the Fire Dragon Scorpion to near-death, it might destroy it's Spiritual Fire Marrow and he would end up empty-handed if that happened. So, he made use of the fact that the Fire Dragon Scorpion had a huge size and burrowed into its body to unleash a fatal attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This method was the most effective method, judging from a certain angle, but it was also the most dangerous. The interior of the Fire Dragon Scorpion was like a furnace. If one were to charge in recklessly, they might be melted by the high temperature. If it was at its top form, then not even Huo Mei’er would dare to burrow into its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the crucial point was that the Fire Dragon Scorpion was gravely injured, barely having even 10% of its strength. So the interior of its body was no longer a forbidden zone. And Mu Chen had also grabbed ahold of this point to burrow into its body and was destroying it from the inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this method might seem simple, the decisiveness and ruthlessness required was something that not any ordinary person could grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also the reason why Huo Mei’er’s gaze had turned grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wasn’t shocked from Mu Chen's strength, but his decisiveness was stunning. She only now understood why Nine Nether would let such a young man take command of the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Mei’er’s gaze changed, a dazzling golden light suddenly flew out from the hole of the Fire Dragon Scorpion’s neck. As magma spewed, the Fire Dragon Scorpion unleashed a mournful cry, before it collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The head of the Fire Dragon Scorpion exploded as a golden light shot out, taking the form of a huge light figure. It was naturally the Great Solar Undying Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, there was redness mixed in the golden Great Solar Undying Body. It appeared to have just stepped out of the furnace, showing signs of melting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Solar Undying Body swiftly dimmed, before dissipating, and a slender figure was revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that figure came out, he couldn’t help vomiting a mouthful of blood. Mu Chen’s clothes had practically been turned to ash and his skin was red, showing signs of melting, and his flesh had revealed eerie white bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, even under the protection of the Great Solar Undying Body, Mu Chen still paid a huge price by entering the body of the Fire Dragon Scorpion. Fortunately, he managed to kill the Fire Dragon Scorpion before he had completely melted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen wiped the smear of blood on the corner or his lips and made a summoning gesture at the corpse of the Fire Dragon Scorpion. A scarlet light that wasn’t at all inferior to the one that Huo Mei’er had previously obtained floated before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the scarlet light, there was a crystalline object with magma slowly flowing within it, emanating a pure Spiritual Energy that instantly made My Chen greedily lick his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purity of the Spiritual Fire Marrow was several times more powerful than those that he had previously refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly clenched his fist. He should be able to start making his breakthrough to Third Grade Sovereign with this Spiritual Fire Marrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tsk, tsk, pretty gusty.” Claps resounded next to him as Huo Mei’er flew over in chuckles. She lightly turned her head and bewitchingly looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fortunately, I’m not dead.” Mu Chen grumbled. There wasn’t any blaming in his tone, since he knew that he did not have any good relation with Huo Mei’er, so she had no obligations in helping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, angry?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er smiled with her eyes narrowed and placed her tender hand on Mu Chen’s naked chest as she moved closer. “Looks like I have belittled you, Nine Nether has brought back a pretty decent one, this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er was alluring and bewitching, not to mention that she seemed to have a very casual character as well. The fragrance that blew over made Mu Chen’s face turn red. Just when he was about to avoid her, he saw the teasing light in the lady’s eyes. He flung his lips aside and stretched his arm out and tried to embrace her soft waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Creak! Creak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before Mu Chen could place his arms around her, Huo Mei’er gently turned her head and her fiery red long hair coiled around Mu Chen’s arm like snakes. She gently gave Mu Chen a touch in his chest, before she alluringly moved back with chuckles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, you’re too tender to take advantage of this Big Sister. Talk to me when you’re a Sixth Grade Sovereign!” Huo Mei’er retreated with chuckles, leaving behind her ringing laughter as she swiftly disappeared in this magma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sixth Grade Sovereign? Just you wait!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help clenching his teeth as he looked at the direction that Huo Mei’er departed. If that day arrives, then he definitely had to give that alluring lady a beating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was only a thought at this faraway wish. He clenched the Spiritual Fire Marrow. Right now, he had to break through to Third Grade Sovereign as soon as possible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, it would be embarrassing if his qualification for the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was seized by Mandala.</span></p>
