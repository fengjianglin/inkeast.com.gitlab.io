Judging from the looks of it, they looked as if they wanted to shoot through him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those three girls could be considered as peerless beauties and they were all talking about him. This kind of treatment was something that any man would be jealous of in their heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had also felt a chill in his heart as those countless arrow-like gazes shot over, before he helplessly glared at Cai Xiao, then cupped his fists towards Su Biyue and Hong Yu. “I appreciate the offer, but it’s too high up there. I’m afraid that someone might not be able to take it, so I will have to refuse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words contained faint ridicule, which everyone was well-aware about who he was talking about. In an instant, some gazes directed over to the indifferent Liu Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Mu Chen’s refusal, Su Biyue and Hong Yu smiled, but they did not insist. However, they couldn’t help taking another look at Cai Xiao. Beauties tended to be sensitive towards each other. From the latter, they felt a trace of faint danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sense of danger left the two girls a little astonished. With their strengths, those that could make them feel danger in the Northern Region could be counted on one hand. So where did this suffocating beauty come from?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the two girls lightly flashed before they turned around and returned to their own seats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had also turned around and returned back to his own seat. He lifted a teacup and couldn’t help glaring at Cai Xiao, whose face had a shallow smile. “Are you trying to kill me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao supported her chin with her hands as she lightly smiled. “Those two ladies are too beautiful and dangerous. I’m helping you here, in case lust dominates your thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re the most dangerous one here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen spoke snappily. He hadn’t been wrong with his words. Although Su Biyue and Hong Yu weren’t people easy to deal with, the one before him was more dangerous in many ways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What an ungrateful fellow.” Cai Xiao shook her head as she cast a glance at the upper floors of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion. “Looks like there are a few decent ones amongst the younger generation of the Northern Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen narrowed his eyes upon hearing her words and directed his gaze at the upper floors of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion as well. Aside from Su Biyue, Hong Yu and Liu Yan, he also sensed a few hidden Spiritual Energy fluctuations. One of the fluctuations gave off an ice-cold feeling, like a piece of ten-thousand-year-old ice that was hidden in the Nine Netherworld.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen sensed that chilling Spiritual Energy fluctuation, the latter seemed to have noticed him as well. The nether ice-cold intent pounced over like a corroding venomous snake. That sort of icy intent, the slightest contact would cause him to be bitten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, Mu Chen never expected that person to be so aggressive. He had only tried to probe, but attracted an attack instead. Immediately, he frowned his brows as he swiftly retracted his Spiritual Energy perception. But when his Spiritual Energy perception returned, it was followed with a bone-chilling coldness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flames surged in Mu Chen’s eyes as the Undying Flames surged, burning that cold aura before retracting his Spiritual Energy perception into his body under the protection of the Undying Flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What an overbearing chill.” Mu Chen looked at a dark corner in the upper floors and his voice was a little grave. When they were hiddenly crossing swords, he had already guessed the identity of the other party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He must be the 2nd rank on the Dragon-Phoenix Record, the Netherworld Prince of the Netherworld Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, the 1st rank, Fang Yi, has yet to show himself?” Mu Chen muttered inwardly as he did not sense another Spiritual Energy more powerful than the Netherworld Prince. There were only two reasons for that. Either Fang Yi had yet to arrive or that fellow had retracted all of his Spiritual Energy fluctuations into his body to the point that Mu Chen could not sense him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was the latter, then how terrifying would this Fang Yi be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze turned a little grave. Looks like none of the rankers on the Dragon-Phoenix Record could be underestimated. Furthermore, the rankings were fabricated, so it wasn’t too trustworthy. Who knows, those experts ranked after Liu Yan might be tougher opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere in the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion returned back to normal. But this time, those gazes that were directed at Mu Chen had the initial contempt replaced with a slight fear. They must have understood from the short confrontation between Mu Chen and Liu Yan that he wasn’t someone to be trifled with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those gazes made Mu Chen feel more relaxed. Although he had revealed a small portion of his strength when he fought with Liu Yan, it was worth the price if it could prevent unnecessary troubles coming at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Mu Chen was estimating how strong the experts participating in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven this time were, there was a clear ring of a bell that suddenly resounded in the pavilion. It an instant, it caused the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion to be silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless impatient gazes were directed at the upper floors of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion. There was an elderly figure that walked out, and along with his appearance, every single gaze became heated up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, looks like the Dragon-Phoenix Haven this time will be more lively…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That elderly figure looked at the youthful, yet possessing sharp demeanour, figures inside the pavilion as he smiled, “Everyone, this old one is the Pavilion Master of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion, Mu Qiu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We greet Pavilion Master Mu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the younger generations in the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion were all elites of the Northern Region, they still returned a polite greeting. Mu Qiu wasn’t an ordinary figure in the Northern Region. Although the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion could only be considered as a front-ranking force in the Northern Region, the existence of the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion was something that only a few in numbers could compare to in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion only guarded the Dragon-Phoenix Ancient City and did not spend any effort in expanding their territories, thus they did not have many enemies. Hence, there weren’t many that were willing to offend them so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Mister Mu, can you please give us some directions about the current situation of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.” Su Biyue of the Myriad Saint Mountains said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to rumours, the cultivation technique practised by the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion originated from the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Therefore, they could vaguely probe some changes in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. During every single opening of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, they would share the information that they have probed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hoho, that’s for sure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Qiu warmly smiled as he continued, “Everyone must be after the Blood Essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix when going into the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. But the situation inside the haven constantly changes, and the situation would be different from the previous one every time it opens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And this time, this old one has news that might not be too good to everyone. I am afraid that there are only five Dragon-Phoenix Pools in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Only five Dragon-Phoenix Pools?” A clamour broke out upon hearing his words and everyone’s faces were somewhat unsightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is a Dragon-Phoenix Pool?” Cai Xiao looked at Mu Chen as she asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Legend has it that in the ancient times, the bones of the True Dragon and Phoenix sprinkled all over the Dragon-Phoenix Haven when they fell. Because of that, some bones of the True Dragon and Phoenix would clash together, forming the bizarre Dragon-Phoenix Pool. All sorts of Spiritual Beasts exists in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, and every single one of them possesses a tiny bit of the True Dragon and Phoenix’s blood. By pouring their blood into the Dragon-Phoenix Pool and borrowing the power contained in the bones of True Dragon and Phoenix, one can refine the ‘Ersatz Dragon Physique’ or the ‘Ersatz Phoenix Physique’.” Mu Chen explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ersatz Dragon Physique and Ersatz Phoenix Physique?” Cai Xiao’s long eyelashes blinked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, because the essence of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven would be the deeper Dragon-Phoenix Stage. The qualification for ascending the stage would be possessing the Ersatz Dragon Physique or the Ersatz Phoenix Physique… That also means that if one wants to get the true treasure, they would have to be baptised by the Dragon-Phoenix Pool. That is also the one and only way.” Mu Chen nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is said that in the previous one, there were nine Dragon-Phoenix Pools. I can’t believe that it’s going to be even less this time, only five.” Mu Chen helplessly sighed. This was basically pouring oil onto the fire. Looks like the Dragon-Phoenix Haven’s competition this time would be even more brutal.</span></p>

He gently waved his dried-up hands as a light screen spread out before him. It seemed to be a fuzzy map with five vague light points on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are the locations of the five Dragon-Phoenix Pools that we have probed,” said Old Man Mu Qiu as everyone instantly focused their gazes over, flickering with spiritual light as they swiftly imprinted the map into their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also staring at the light screen and swiftly memorised it. Although the map was fuzzy, it was still better than going around blindly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao stared at the map thoughtfully and suddenly asked, “How do they probe the locations of the Dragon-Phoenix Pools?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he frowned his brows, “It’s said that the cultivation technique practised by the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion comes from the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Therefore, they can do initial probings through space.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That also means that it might not only be five Dragon-Phoenix Pools, right? If my guesses are correct, there is also a difference in strength in those Dragon-Phoenix Pools…” Cai Xiao lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned upon hearing her words and he seriously nodded his head. “What you say is correct. However, the danger lies all around in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven with countless powerful beasts that have inherited the Blood Essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix. They might not have a high intellect, but their strengths are extremely terrifying. Recklessly going around is very dangerous. So, generally, there won’t be anyone that will do further explorations.”</span></p>
