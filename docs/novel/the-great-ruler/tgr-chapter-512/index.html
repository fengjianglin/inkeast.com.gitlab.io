Shortly after, he wrinkled his brows as he looked at the Spiritual Treasure Mountain before him. The entire Spiritual Treasure Mountain was emitting dazzling light that seemed as if it was created from gems. Purified Spiritual Energy was spreading out along with a fragrance that covered the entire mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen did not sense anything out of the ordinary. The point being was that this place was too quiet. However, every single part of the Divine Wood Palace was this quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This kind of place is extremely important to every force. Therefore, some forces would lay countless hidden Spiritual Array traps here to prevent them from being stolen by other people. Although this Divine Wood Palace was destroyed for countless of years, some of the Spiritual Array traps that they have placed here might not have been destroyed. After all, as long as there is a sufficient amount of Spiritual Energy, these kinds of things could last forever. Furthermore, from the looks of it… this place doesn’t lack in any Spiritual Energy.” Wen Qingxuan said as her charming gaze fell onto the Spiritual Treasure Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s brows was knitted together. What Wen Qingxuan said did make sense. Therefore, it was better for them to be cautious here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Someone’s here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was pondering, Luo Li’s voice suddenly resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyes condensed. There was actually someone here already in such a short amount of time, it seemed that many teams that came into the Divine Wood Palace all made their preparations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen took a closer look at the two approaching groups, he could not help inhaling a mouthful of air. One of the two groups that came here was Wang Zhong’s group from the Saint Spiritual Academy. The other one made Mu Chen feel a headache and the origin of his headache was the fiery red-dressed girl that stood at the front of her group, wielding a huge scarlet-red crescent blade, Wu Yingying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the two groups that came were his enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhong and Wu Yingying’s group maintained their distance. Clearly, they were cautious with one another. However, when they saw that the first to reach here was Mu Chen’s group, they fell into daze as their expressions somewhat respectively changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhong still maintained a smile on his face. However, his gaze was a little cold as he constantly looked at Mu Chen and the Spiritual Treasure Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yingying, however, tightly clenched her teeth as she stared at Mu Chen with hatred. She still had the look of a ferocious leopardess. If it was not for the youth behind her, Deng Tong, holding her back, she would definitely not be able to endure it and charge forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen took a glance towards the two parties and looked into the distance again. Thereafter, he discovered that there was a large group of light streaks that was approaching towards this direction. Clearly, this was a huge group. Although these huge groups were fighting for their own, the amount was extremely significant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These teams were extremely smart. Upon entering the remnants of the Divine Wood Palace, they had followed after Wang Zhong and Wu Yingying, who had obtained a Divine Wood Quote from faraway. They were well-aware that in terms of news of the Divine Wood Palace, Wang Zhong and Wu Yingying had an advantage, since they definitely knew more than them. Therefore, they followed behind them. Even if they could not obtain the biggest benefit, they could still benefit something from it. However, their choice was correct. At least they had found this Spiritual Treasure Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyes flickered before his expression calmed down. He did not panic just because of Wang Zhong and Wu Yingying’s appearances and try to seize the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi. After Wen Qingxuan’s reminder earlier, he felt that it would not be so easy to seize the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Captain Mu Chen, your group has arrive quite fast.” Wang Zhong stood on the sky as they looked at Mu Chen’s group. He first made a smile towards Wen Qingxuan, before speaking with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Captain Wang Zhong, you’re not too slow yourself.” Mu Chen smiled in reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are extremely precious Spiritual Treasures in this Spiritual Treasure Mountain. So I naturally have to make my way here quick enough. Otherwise, it would be taken by someone else.” Wang Zhong smiled as he took a glance at the peak of the Spiritual Treasure Mountain that was emitting endless light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard his reply, he could not help narrowing his eyes. From the looks of it, Wang Zhong and Wu Yingying had also received the news of the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yingying stared at Mu Chen, before coldly snorting. Her jade-like hands wielded her crescent blade. She tilted her blade as an extremely sharp blade of light flickered. The young girl’s charming oval-like face was filled with chill as a raging figure filled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Captain Wu Yingying, since Captain Mu Chen and Wen Qingxuan are working together. Why don’t we work together for the moment as well, so that we avoid a situation where we are unable to touch the Spiritual Treasure Mountain?” Wang Zhong laughed as his eyes flashed from looking at the scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Wen Qingxuan were already working together. Although they were only two teams, their fighting strength was absolutely powerful. Although their three teams were not easy for anyone to deal with, there was, after all, some risk. If they could work together with Wu Yingying, then they would have the absolute advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, from Wu Yingying’s attitude towards Mu Chen earlier, it seemed that she had a huge grudge towards him, which Wang Zhong could make use of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s expression turned cold. Clearly, he had seen through Wang Zhong’s intention. If Wu Yingying cooperated with them, it would spell some troubles for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Wu Yingying heard Wang Zhong’s words, her brows twitched as her eyes were a little irregular. She seemed to have been moved by that idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although your team is strong, Brother Wu Ling of the Martial Spiritual Academy is not here. Based on your own strength, I’m afraid that you are not their opponent. So if we were to join hands, it would benefit both of us.” Seeing as Wu Yingying was a little moved by the idea, Wang Zhong immediately added on to strike the iron while it was hot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Wu Yingying, Deng Tong and his group exchanged glances as they had no comments. They had given the decision-making over to Wu Yingying. Clearly, among their group, it was Wu Yingying that had been making the decisions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yingying took a glance at the sincere Wang Zhong, before shifting her gaze towards Mu Chen. She realised that the latter did not have any expression on his face. This made her chuckle. Whenever Mu Chen was facing her, he was always smiling, which she found annoying. This was the first time that she had seen the helpless and expressionless look on Mu Chen’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, without any expression was actually a type of expressive mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re afraid that I will join hands with him?” Wu Yingying said as she stared at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen said lightly, “You’re overthinking things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yingying coldly snorted as she looked towards Wang Zhong, “I will definitely not let this fellow off, but I will deal with him myself. I do not need the help of anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhong, who still had a smile on his face, stiffened. He looked at Wu Yingying in amazement. After a brief moment later, he made a ugly smile with his face, “What a regret.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, on the other hand, looked at Wu Yingying in astonishment. Clearly, he had no idea why the latter would give up on a chance that could create problems for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tsk. Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan by the side pulsed her lips as she sighed. She approached Luo Li with a smile hung on the corner of her face and said with a deep meaning, “Why does this Wu Yingying seem like a wife acting in a fit of pique?”</span></p>
