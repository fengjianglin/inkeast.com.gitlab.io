 <p><strong>Chapter 311 - Pursuit of the Spirit King</strong></p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>The earth shuddered as the countless Spirit Pawns that formed the Spirit Pawn Army was restless at this moment. Streams of light shot out from the depths, without daring to stop for the slightest degree.</p>
 <p>These Spirit Pawns did not obstruct those that were rushing out. However, under the former’s struggle, they were able to feel the pressure that’s akin to a Spirit King was rapidly spreading from the depths.</p>
 <p>This pressure made them unable to move a single step.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As the pressure radiated out, a dazzling giant that’s over 300 metres high stepped out from the depths, quaking the earth and shook the mountains as it marched forth. The earth split apart under its feet as the ferocious cracks continuously extended out.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The eye-piercingly bright giant roared, causing incomparable berserking Spiritual Energy sound waves that shattered the unfortunate Spirit Pawns as they radiated out. However, the giant did not pay the slightest bit of attention to them as it locked onto the figure at the front and relentlessly pursued it without the thought to give up.</p>
 <p>“Damn it.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the Spirit King that did not at all care about other people as it chased after him, Mu Chen’s face changed.</p>
 <p>“Why is that big fellow chasing us?” Wang Tong and the rest had also discovered the situation and instantly became slightly flustered. As of now, the strength of this Spirit King had risen dramatically. Without even talking about them, even if Zhao Qingshan and Xu Huang were to attack together, they would still not be able to be its opponent.</p>
 <p>“Its coming for me.” Mu Chen replied while clenching his teeth as he continued, “I’ll lure it away by myself. You guys leave first and find a safe place.”</p>
 <p>“That’s too dangerous!” Wang Tong, An Ran and the rest hurriedly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“If it continues to chase us like that, it’ll eventually catch up to us.” Mu Chen replied as he shook his head. There wasn’t much panic showing within his black eyes. Taking a deep breath, he declared, “Let’s split up.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll accompany you!” Luo Li exclaimed while softly biting her lip. She was extremely firm and blunt. The Spirit King before them was extremely strong. If Mu Chen tried to deal with it alone, it might be very troublesome for him. Therefore, she had to come along with him.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen faintly hesitated, before nodding his head. He did not try to show off his ability. As of now. although the Spirit King could not be considered as having completely crossing over from its weak and newly born phase, there was no need to doubt its strength. If he tried to deal with it alone, it truly would be very thorny.</p>
 <p>After nodding his head, he did not say anything more. With a move of his body, a dragon roar resounded out as he immediately displayed the Dragon Soaring Art. His figure transformed into the shadow of a dragon, rapidly shooting towards another direction akin to lightning.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Luo Li’s beautiful body moved and immediately followed after him. Her speed appeared to be not much slower than Mu Chen, who was displaying the Dragon Soaring Art.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Following the change in Mu Chen’s direction, the Spirit King that was chasing them had also immediately sensed it. While roaring, it chased after Mu Chen once again.</p>
 <p>The ray of light in the front, the giant at the back. The earth trembled as they rapidly disappeared from everyone ‘s line-of-sight.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.” Wang Tong looked over at Mu Chen’s and Luo Li’s figures heading into the distance and clenched his teeth. Immediately turning his body, he brought An Ran and the rest towards the outside of the Spirit Pawn Army. As of now, if they were to follow Mu Chen’s side, not only would they not be of the slightest use, they would even drag him down.</p>
 <p>The other people had also understood. Although worry and unease filled their eyes, they still rapidly followed Wang Tong and left.</p>
 <p>Since the Spirit King was chasing after Mu Chen, the people who were fleeing in fright from other directions had also noticed this. Soon after, they gradually came to a stop as they looked at the direction that the Spirit King had headed towards with doubtful eyes.</p>
 <p>“What happened? Why did the Spirit King only head towards Mu Chen?” up in the air, Zhao Qingshan said with his brows wrinkled.</p>
 <p>“Previously, only Mu Chen had entered the underground cave. He had definitely obtained something there; therefore, making the Spirit King chase after him.” Mu Fengyang replied while clenching his teeth, his eyes brimming with the fires of anger. He was the one that thought of luring trouble to Mu Chen. However, who would have thought that Mu Chen was not only not sent out of the hunting grounds, he had even discovered the secret underground cave. Although the did not know exactly what Mu Chen did in the underground cave, since he was able to make the Spirit King relentlessly chase after him without giving up, how could the thing that he had obtained be common?</p>
 <p>Speaking from this point, didn’t he give Mu Chen a chance to obtain a treasure?</p>
 <p>Thinking about this scenario, Mu Fengyang was furious till his face turned green.</p>
 <p>“What should we do?” Mu Fengyang said as he looked towards Zhao Qingshan. They had lost over ten people, and they haven’t even dredged up a single hair. How could this make them give up?</p>
 <p>Zhao Qingshan’s eyes sparkled, as he was similarly not willing to leave without the slightest bit of harvest. Slightly muttering to himself, he clenched his teeth and replied, “Let’s wait a bit, before following those two. Let’s see if there will be a chance for us. If there is, we’ll attack. If there isn’t, we’ll rapidly retreat.”</p>
 <p>He was a decisive person, and was clear that the current Spirit King was too strong and not something they could deal with. The only thing they could do was wait for an opportunity. If they rashly attacked, they would only end up being sent out of the hunting grounds.</p>
 <p>Mu Fengyang nodded his head and looked towards the direction the Spirit King had gone. If the benefits of this place was obtained by Mu Chen, he’ll truly be depressed until he vomited blood.</p>
 <p>In the air, at another direction, Xu Huang had also stopped in his tracks. His gaze stared at the direction the Spirit King had gone, his eyes sparkling.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Within the layers of mountain, a strong gale resounded as two figures shot by. Without the slightest degree of stopping, they shot over to a distant place. Not long after they shot by, the earth started to move, the mountains started to shake, and the mountain range started to collapse. In the distance, a giant over 300 metres tall rapidly shot over, eye-piercing Spiritual Light caused it to look akin to a clump of scorching suns, making several people unable to directly stare at it.</p>
 <p>It furiously roared, causing some Spiritual Lights to shoot out, smashing apart mountains. While doing so, it crazily chased after the two figures in the front.</p>
 <p>Its figure was gigantic; however, its speed was as fast as lightning. Using its full strength to pursue them, it able to gradually close in on Mu Chen, who had displayed the Dragon Soaring Art.</p>
 <p>“Its speed is very fast. Furthermore, it has an endless supply of Spiritual Energy. If we continue running, we’ll end up being the first to be unable to maintain this speed.” Luo Li shot a look at the Spirit King, who was gradually getting closer. Her eyes were grave as she looked at Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s face sank. He naturally knew that what Luo Li said was not false. The Spirit King had locked onto him. Obviously, it would not give up until it snatched the broken fragment of the Spirit Crystal back from Mu Chen. However, once it snatched the fragment back, it would truly cross over from its newly born phase. At that time, perhaps even a true Heavenly Completion Stage expert would be unable to hold it back. If, by any chance, still wanted to kill him, there would be nothing more miserable than that.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s eyes faintly sparkled. As of now, the best way was to kill the Spirit King here. Although the Spirit King was very strong, he wasn’t forced to the point where he had no methods left.</p>
 <p>“This was originally prepared for He Yao. Since you, bastard, wants to chase me relentlessly without giving up, I’ll let you have a taste of it first!”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was also a decisive person, and quickly decided on his decision. A chilling intent flashed within his eyes. Tilting his head towards Luo Li, he said, “Can you hold that bastard back for a little while?”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Luo Li gently nodded her small head. Her jade-like hand slowly clenched tightly around the Luo Shen Sword on her waist. On its scabbard, there seemed to be a frosty air circulating around it.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen gave a smile. He wasn’t especially worried about Luo Li, as the latter’s methods were something that even he was unable to clearly understand. In addition, there was the “Luo Shen Sword” in her hands. That was truly a Divine Weapon. Although it was in a sealed state at the moment, the two simple words “Divine Weapon” was synonymous to “Strong” and “Powerful”. Mu Chen had never even seen the appearance of a Divine Weapon before. That was a thing that would even cause a Sovereign’s heartbeat to race.</p>
 <p>After the two had made a consensus, their figures rapidly shot out, before descending onto the peak of a distant mountain.</p>
 <p>Upon landing, Mu Chen immediately crossed his legs and sat down. His eyes were faintly closed, while his hands rapidly created seals. While his Spiritual Energy fluctuated, Spiritual Seals condensed and rapidly flew out one after another.</p>
 <p>“He wants to set up a Spiritual Array?” Luo Li said, while staring at Mu Chen. From the looks of it, he obviously wanted to set up a Spiritual Array to counter the Spirit King. However, the Spirit King before them was tyrannical. Even a Rank 4 Spiritual Array would be hard to cause any life-threatening injuries towards it. Unless, it was a Rank 5 Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>However, as of now, Mu Chen was considered a Rank 4 Spiritual Array Master. Deploying a Rank 4 Spiritual Array wasn’t that difficult for him. However, if it was a Rank 5 Spiritual Array, even if he had comprehended the Heart Array State, it might still not be that easy.</p>
 <p>The higher the rank of the Spiritual Array, the more complicated it was. When it reached a certain degree, the Heart Array State would not be sufficient to provide much of a advantage. After all, the Heart Array State was still a very elemental state in the eyes of those true Spiritual Array Masters of the Grandmaster and Ancestral Ranks.</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s vision looked towards Mu Chen’s handsome and outstanding face before giving a faint smile. If anyone was to compare their confidence in Mu Chen, there would be no one who had more than her. This confidence was accumulated during the year that they had lived together in the Spiritual Road. At that cruel place, this youth had never given up from the start till the end. He might have received oppression, and had failed before, but he had endured all of it. In addition, he had become increasingly tenacious. In this point, even the arrogant Luo Li had felt quiet admiration in her heart.</p>
 <p>If not for Ji Xuan taking fancy for her in the Spiritual Road, the usually calm Mu Chen would not have bothered to start such a slaughter, which had led to him being kicked out of the Spiritual Road.</p>
 <p>“Ji Xuan…”</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s jade-like hands slowly clenched tightly as the cold glint in her eyes condensed. Thinking about his talent, after entering the “Spiritual Saint Academy”, he would be the most outstanding person there. From the looks of it then, Mu Chen still had the chance to cross hands with him. At that time, it would be a real exchange.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A roar rang out while Luo Li’s mind was still elsewhere. The earth trembled, and the mountain range continuously shook. In the far distance, a brilliance akin to a scorching sun swept over.</p>
 <p>Luo Li looked towards the incoming Spirit King, before shooting a look at Mu Chen, who had closed his eyes and was preparing a Spiritual Array. Her jade-like hand suddenly gripped the longsword on her waist tightly. With a gentle tap of her slender jade-like feet, her beautiful figure shot forward in a flash, and appeared in mid-air</p>
 <p>“You should stop.”</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s clear and limpid eyes reflected the gigantic image as a clear and cold voice resounded within this stretch of the world, while carrying along a swift and fierce Sword Qi that was gradually condensing together.</p>
 <p>The Spirit King did not have any intelligence, and naturally could not understand her words. It looked at the puny figure blocking its path. While roaring, the gigantic palm had carried along a Spiritual Light that blotted the sky as it violent patted down on Luo Li in a fury.</p>
 <p>A chilling intent flashed past Luo Li’s exquisite face. Those clear and limpid eyes grew increasingly incisive. In the next instant, she took a step forward. With a tremble of her jade-like hand, the black longsword in her hand instantly unsheathed.</p>
 <p>Ring!</p>
 <p>A clear sound rang out, as the entire stretch of the world reverberated with the light roar of the sword being unsheathed. A sky-blue Sword Qi transcended the heavens and rushed to the skies as if it wanted to shatter the heavens and crush the earth.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>That Sword Qi violently shot towards to giant palm that furiously patted over, causing metallic sounds to ring out. In the distance, Zhao Qingshan, Xu Huang and the rest that had chased after them stared dumbfoundedly as the Spirit King was sent flying. A mountain peak was smashed apart as it flew backwards.</p>
 <p>All of them sucked in a breath of cold air as they stared in shock at the scene before them, where a young lady dressed in an ink-black dress stood in mid-air. In her hand was a longsword, rippling with faint fluctuations as it slowly radiated out.</p>
 <p>It was a scene that had startled everyone.</p>
