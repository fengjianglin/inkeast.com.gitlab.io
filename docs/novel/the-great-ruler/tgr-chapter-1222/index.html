 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Flame Emperor, Xiao Yan?!” When Battle Emperor’s astonished voice resounded, everyone was astounded as they looked at the man standing before Mu Chen in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s because everyone in the Great Thousand World knew of that name well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a legend, whether it was his extraordinary strength or his ability to establish the Endless Fire Territory in merely a few hundred years with a foundation that surpassed some ancient clans. The Endless Fire Territory became one of the supreme forces in the Great Thousand World that even ancient clans wouldn’t dare to underestimate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the West Heaven Battle Emperor was famous, everyone knew that there’s a gap between him and this Flame Emperor of the Endless Fire Territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was akin to a pinnacle powerhouse and a legend amongst the pinnacle powerhouses…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such an existence wasn’t something that could be seen often. But right now… Mu Chen summoned the legendary Flame Emperor…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, all the gazes directed at Mu Chen changed. Those gazes turned to fear that was even more intense than when they looked at Mandala.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingzi, who was previously rejoicing at Mandala and Mu Chen’s situation, suddenly had a comical expression. Not only him, but even the powerhouses of the Blood God Clan also wore pale expressions as they started to sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They trembled as they looked at Mu Chen in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingzi wiped the sweat on his forehead while feeling dizzy from the boiling emotions in his mind. He never expected that not even a Heavenly Sovereign couldn’t deal with Mu Chen. That monstrous fellow actually invited a legend of the Great Thousand World…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Mu Chen… what is his background?!” Xue Lingzi roared in his heart. If he knew that Mu Chen would invite the Flame Emperor over, he wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant, even if he was hundred-fold bolder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But speaking from a certain degree, it’s impossible for a Lesser Earth Sovereign to invite a Heavenly Sovereign, even if they emptied their fortune!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like how an ant couldn’t summon an elephant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Xue Lingzi and the rest were trembling with shock, the eyes of those from the Luo God Clan beamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They looked at Mu Chen with a convinced gazes. If they were feeling jealous of Mu Chen and Luo Li’s relationship previously, they were utterly convinced at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen was not only outstanding, he even had a powerful connection that could invite a Heavenly Sovereign. Perhaps only such a man was compatible with their Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Flame Emperor stood with his hands behind his back. There wasn’t any domineering aura emanating from his body, but everyone could feel that the pressure coming from the Battle Emperor was swiftly dissipating from his existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a few breaths’ time, everyone felt the terrifying pressure had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Flame Emperor appeared, he did not bother with the astonished gazes directed at him. He looked around the Luo God Clan with a reminiscing smile. “I never thought that I would come back to the Luo God City after so many years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Flame Emperor has come to the Luo God Clan in the past?” Mu Chen was briefly stunned before he asked in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I have an old relationship with the Luo God Clan.” Flame Emperor laughed before he looked at Luo Tianshen with a smile. “Senior Luo, it has been many years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Tianshen was stunned while looking at the Flame Emperor and sighed with complicated feelings. He bitterly smiled. “You’re no longer that lost kid from before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, when the Flame Emperor came to the Great Thousand World, he descended in the Luo God Clan. Back then, the Flame Emperor was still cultivating the Dou Qi that hadn’t been assimilated into Spiritual Energy. So he was extremely weak back then, not to mention that he wasn’t familiar with the Great Thousand World. Thus, he was lost in the Luo God City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, Luo Tianshen was already the Patriarch of the Luo God Clan. Due to pure coincidence, he encountered the Flame Emperor and even granted the latter help. But the Flame Emperor had to quickly leave since he had to search for his wives and friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Tianshen had heard some news about the Flame Emperor, knowing that the latter had established the Endless Fire Territory and leapt up to be amongst the Heavenly Sovereigns of the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had thoughts of seeking help from the Endless Fire Territory, but he refused that idea since he wasn’t sure that he could invite the Flame Emperor over based on that little favour back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the Flame Emperor was an almighty existence in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reaching that height, perhaps the Flame Emperor had long forgotten the Luo God Clan. Furthermore, the most important factor was that Luo Tianshen had casually granted help to the Flame Emperor. So it was the wildest thing to imagine that he could invite a Heavenly Sovereign with that small favour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Heavenly Emperor was an existence far from his reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Flame Emperor heard Luo Tianshen’s words, he instantly appeared before the latter and held onto Luo Tianshen’s hand with both of his hands. “Senior Luo, what are you saying? Are you making me, Xiao Yan, seem ungrateful? Back then, if it wasn’t you that helped me assimilate my Dou Qi into Spiritual Energy, who knows how long I would have had to take to accomplish that. If that’s the case, I would have probably suffered from a life of regrets by the time I found my wives and friends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Luo Tianshen heard Xiao Yan’s voice, it seemed that his wives and friends were in a perilous situation. If the latter did not reach them in time, the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never thought that his help to the Flame Emperor would be so great. Instantly, Luo Tianshen was stunned and a gratified smile appeared on his face. He briefly hesitated before he sighed and patted the Flame Emperor’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Luo is injured?” The Flame Emperor noticed Luo Tianshen’s wittering face and instantly felt an abnormality in the latter’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Tianshen smiled. “It’s just some Demonic Blood Poison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was caused by Xue Lingzi when they fought back then, and it was also the reason behind his body getting weak. If this continued, then he would definitely fall because of that poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that poison was exceptionally domineering, not to mention that it had accumulated in his body for a long time. So even a Perfected Earth Sovereign would have a hard time removing the poison for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Flame Emperor smiled. “Not an issue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gently patted Luo Tianshen’s arm and a strand of flames burrowed into the latter’s body. In the next moment, Luo Tianshen’s face turned red with drops of smelly blood oozing from his pores and evaporated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a few breaths’ time, Luo Tianshen’s face had turned red. His Spiritual Energy suddenly cleared up and the corner of his lips couldn’t help twitching. He never thought that the Blood Demonic Poison that had plagued him for a long time would be so easily removed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Flame Emperor dispelled the poison for Luo Tianshen, Xue Lingzi started to furiously sweat as his face turned pale. He never thought that not only could Mu Chen invite the Flame Emperor, the existence in legend even had a relationship with Luo Tianshen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden development made his limbs start to tremble. If he knew that the Luo God Clan had a relationship with the Flame Emperor, how could he dare to bully the Luo God Clan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Luo, something happened to the Luo God Clan?” After dispelling the poison for Luo Tianshen, the Flame Emperor looked at this situation and asked with a smile and his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Tianshen briefly hesitated before explaining everything in detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never thought that Mu Chen actually invited you here…” Luo Tianshen bitterly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Flame Emperor nodded his head as he turned to Mu Chen and smiled. “Fortunately, Mu Chen invited me over. Otherwise, I, Xiao Yan, would be an ungrateful person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen scratched his head. He was in a desperate situation, and so, he resorted to seeking help from the Flame Emperor. However, he never thought that he would receive a thank you from the Flame Emperor due to this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leave this matter to me.” Flame Emperor smiled towards Luo Tianshen before raising his head and looked at the West Heaven Battle Emperor that was emanating a dreadful pressure in the sky with a smile. “I have long heard of the West Heaven Battle Emperor’s fame. I never thought that I would get to meet you here today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The West Heaven Battle Emperor solemnly looked at the Flame Emperor, before slowly saying, “I have also heard of the Flame Emperor’s fame.”</span></p>
