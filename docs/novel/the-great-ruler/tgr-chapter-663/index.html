 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space fluctuated behind Mu Chen as a figure gradually showed up, followed by Lin Jing’s exclamation of joy becoming clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen also couldn’t help himself from turning over with shock as he saw a white-dressed lady. She was elegant, serene with absolute beauty. Faintly, there were similarities between her and Lin Jing. Her hair was tied together and her evidently cold temperament could stun others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Mu Chen more astonished was that this white-dressed lady before his eyes was the mother of Lin Jing. From appearance, they didn’t seem like mother and daughter, they were more like sisters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the one that quietly chopped the hand of the grey-clothed elderly man off? Based on her words from before… the little princess of the Martial Realm, was she talking about Lin Jing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Martial Realm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s heart jolted as he looked at Lin Jing, who was in his embrace with shock. He never expected her to have such an unusual background. Martial Realm was one of the significant forces that dominated one region in the Great Thousand World, with the founder of the Martial Realm, Martial Ancestor being one of the most powerful existences!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Sky Profound Palace was formidable, it wasn’t much compared to the Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now, did Mu Chen come to an understanding about why Lin Jing would carry those powerful Defensive Spiritual Jades all around her, she was the little princess of the Martial Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jing stared at the white-dressed lady with wide eyes as she pounced over in joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-dressed lady stretched her finger and flicked Lin Jing’s forehead as she spoke in displeasure, “You actually dare to sneak out, what guts you have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her features were clear and cold, but when she looked at the girl before her, they were filled with pampering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s so boring at home.” Lin Jing held on her head as she spoke in a pitiful manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your father has already said that he will definitely not let you go so easily when you return back this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, you have to save me!” Lin Jing wore a pitiful expression as she grabbed onto the sleeve of the white-dressed lady, “Wasn’t I coming out to gain experience? Furthermore, you nearly lost me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speaking of this, the white-dressed lady narrowed her eyes. In the next instant, cold surged in her pupils as she raised her head, looked at the grey-clothed elderly man before her and said with indifference, “You’re pretty daring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?!” The grey-clothed elderly man recovered from his shock. He did not bother about his separated hands as he exclaimed with a smear of dense shock on his aged face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re someone of the Martial Realm?!” He suddenly recalled the words from before as he said in a hoarse voice with shock in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, don’t spare him, he was trying to kill me earlier. If it wasn’t for Mu Chen, your daughter would definitely be with missing arms and broken legs!” Lin Jing spoke out with indignation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-dressed lady lowered her head as she looked at Mu Chen, who was seated on the ground in a terrible state with a blooded back that exposed his bones. Her voice turned gentle as she smiled, “Little Brother, thank you for that. Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being addressed in this manner by such a lady with such a young appearance made Mu Chen feel a little awkward as he scratched his head and smiled, “I’m fine. I have rough skin and tough meat, this is just a little injury.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-dressed lady glanced at the injury on his back and realised that purple Spiritual Energy was flowing. Among the purple Spiritual Energy, there seemed to be peculiar purple flames wriggling. His injuries were swiftly recovering in the places that the fire passed by, displaying astonishing recovery ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smear of astonishment flashed across the white-dressed lady’s face as she rested her heart. She shifted her gaze towards the grey-clothed elderly man, whose face was continually changing, as she spoke in a cold and calm voice, “Being so ruthless to two kids, did you think that my Martial Realm is so easy to bully?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey-clothed elderly man’s body trembled as his gaze changed. In the next instant, his figure mysteriously flew out, drawing a streak of an afterimage. He appeared beside Liu Ming, who was heavily injured as he grabbed him and attempted to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far away, when the Heart Fairy Fox and the middle-aged man witnessed this scene, they felt shock in their hearts and the dense shock was revealed in their eyes. Just who was that lady in white? She just showed herself and caused the Demonic Human Elder, whose strength was of the Eighth Grade Sovereign Realm, to flee?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, don’t let him escape!” Seeing the old fellow attempting to escape, Lin Jing quickly called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-dressed lady nodded her head as she extended her slender handout and gave a light lift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground rumbled far away as a colossal mountain was lifted from the ground. The mountain was multi-coloured, dazzling with light. If one were to sense it more attentively, they would realise that this mountain was not from simple rocks, it was formed from purely Spiritual Energy. The fluctuation of that Spiritual Energy was indescribably powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge mountain lifted up and appeared up on the horizon with a flash. After that, it heavily slammed down towards a direction, freezing the space of that region and revealed two silhouettes, the Demonic Human Elder and Liu Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demonic Human Elder raised his head in fear as he watched the colossal mountain descending from the horizon and exclaimed, “Heaven and Earth Phase?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance away, the Heart Fairy Fox duo also had their expressions changed as their eyes were filled with shock. It was actually the Heaven and Earth Phase, solely possessed by those of the Earth Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady in white before them was actually an Earth Sovereign?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heaven and Earth Phase represented the ability to create a mountain and river with a wave of their hand, changing the terrains. It was extremely profound. If it was to destroy the terrain, Mu Chen could easily achieve it with his current strength. But if he were tasked to create land out of nothing, it would be difficult for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy mountain pressed down, entirely sealing that space. Even the grey-clothed elderly man couldn’t budge and could only watch the mountain whistling over and pressing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pffft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy seemed to have gone limp in the old man, his bones looked like they had shattered. Fresh blood was spurting from his mouth as it was suppressed along with the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the mountain made of Spiritual Energy landed on the ground, the mountain that was of tens of thousands of meters became the tallest peak in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Spiritual Energy was being suppressed, the old man couldn’t budge in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Witnessing this scene, Mu Chen couldn’t help inhaling a mouthful of cold air. This was the first time that he had seen a genuine Earth Sovereign attacking. The power that they could display with a wave of their hand was genuinely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far away, the black-clothed old man, who was being held up by Nine Nether, sensed the movements over in this direction and was frightened out of his wits. There wasn’t any hesitation as he scurried off, no longer carrying the bearing of a Sovereign expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when he was about to escape, he felt a dreadful energy descending from the sky. After that, he felt as if he had suffered a heavy impact and fell to the ground, creating a massive crater in the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The colossal Nine Netherworld Bird was swiftly shrinking in size, returning into a slender silhouette. Nine Nether flew over and landed beside Mu Chen, she was a little amazed as she looked at the mysterious lady in white that had appeared without her knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s Lin Jing’s mother.” Mu Chen gets up with great difficulty as he explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether then understood and quickly helped Mu Chen as she nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, how are we going to deal with those fellows?” Lin Jing chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They will be suppressed in this location for five years.” The lady in white spoke casually as she waved her hand, sending the black-clothed old man beneath the Spiritual Energy mountain to be suppressed. The mountain started to slowly sink as it disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was amazed as he watched the Spiritual Energy mountain sink down. The land was still flat, no one could have imagined that there were three unfortunate fellows suppressed beneath the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Trapped for five years, the grey-clothed old man might be able to survive with his cultivation of the Eighth Grade Sovereign Realm, but his strength would significantly decline at that time. As for Liu Ming, it was a question if he was even able to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen clearly wouldn’t pity them. If it wasn’t for Lin Jing’s mother appearing earlier, their outcome might not be any better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, you came at the right time!” Lin Jing held onto the lady-in-white’s arm as she smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you think that with that little capability of yours, you can sneak out of the Martial Realm?” The lady-in-white was looking at Lin Jing with ridicule as she continued, “If it weren’t for me following you the whole time, you would have been dragged home by your father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Lin Jing instantly sunk down. The escape plan that she had initially thought to be perfect had ended up being so worthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was inwardly wiping his sweat. Fortunately, he didn’t have any ill intentions for Lin Jing. Otherwise, he might have been killed by this mother of hers that was hidden in the dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Thousand World was truly dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inwardly sighed, he initially had a low opinion of Liu Ming. But he never imagined that this fellow would have such a fearsome Elder protecting him, causing him to nearly fail miserably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Little Brother…” the lady in white looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior can address me as Mu Chen…” Mu Chen scratched his head as he felt the manner of the address being awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady-in-white smiled, her smile was charming. She had been following Lin Jing, so she naturally knew how Mu Chen treated Lin Jing. Thus, she had a favourable opinion of him as well, revealing a rare smile on her face as she said in a gentle voice, “Then I’ll call you Xiao Chen. Pass me that Mustard Seed Bracelet from earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any hesitation when Mu Chen retrieved it and handed it over to the lady-in-white. With the latter’s identity, he did not worry that she would take fancy to those items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady-in-white was somewhat satisfied with Mu Chen’s straightforward actions. She took it and rays of light surged on her palm, entering into the Mustard Seed Bracelet for a brief moment before retracting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s an imprint left behind by an Earth Sovereign expert in this Mustard Seed Bracelet. If you had just taken it this way, you would probably be sensed by him. However, now that I have removed it, there’s nothing to worry about anymore.” The lady-in-white spoke as she handed the Mustard Seed Bracelet back to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen wiped his forehead of sweat. Although he wasn’t rash enough to look in the Mustard Seed Bracelet, he never thought that there would be an imprint left behind by an Earth Sovereign expert. It should probably be left by the Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thank Senior for this.” Mu Chen gratefully thanked her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady-in-white smiled as she shook her head and pamperly rubbed Lin Jing’s head, “You have saved Xiao Jing. If you don’t mind, you can call me Aunt Ling.”</span></p>
