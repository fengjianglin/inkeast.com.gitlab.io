The reason why it was famous was naturally that of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven in the Dragon-Phoenix Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Legend had it that in the ancient times, there was a True Dragon and True Phoenix that unleashed a great shocking battle. That battle caused tens of thousands of meters to be levelled to the ground, even the sky was shattered in that fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the powerful Dragon and Phoenix Clans, the True Dragon and True Phoenix were the strongest existences, powerful existences that possessed strengths that rivalled Heavenly Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That shocking battle ended with the fall of those two terrifying creatures, and their graveyard turned into the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. It’s said that the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was dyed in the blood of the True Dragon and Phoenix, causing it to be extremely abnormal. Many treasures that could not be found outside were everywhere in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so much so that if one could get the blood essences of the True Dragon or Phoenix, they could refine the True Dragon Physique and True Phoenix Physique upon refining them. If they succeeded, the toughness of their physiques would nearly be comparable to the Dragon and Phoenix Clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crucial point was that the blood essence of a True Dragon and Phoenix would also bestow powerful vitality. It was common knowledge that the terrifying part of Divine Beasts was that they possessed a vitality that humans could never compare to. If humans could also obtain a vitality similar to them, it would undoubtedly be greatly beneficial in the path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from that, there were also rumours that the Dragon-Phoenix Haven had the inheritance left behind by the True Dragon and Phoenix hidden within. If they could obtain it, it would practically be ascending the heavens in a single step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, after all these years, whenever the Dragon-Phoenix Haven opened, no one had heard of anyone obtaining the inheritance left behind by the True Dragon and Phoenix. Thus, it didn’t rule out that the rumour was fabricated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, even so, whenever the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was about to open, not only were the geniuses of the Northern Region’s younger generations stirred, even the peak forces out of the Northern Region would drool and send their representatives over as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, as time passed, the Dragon-Phoenix Haven became the gold-bearing standard used to examine the younger generations of the Northern Region. Thus, the so-called “Dragon-Phoenix Record” was born.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, no matter what, the opening of Dragon-Phoenix Haven every single time would be the main focus of attention in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen left the Great Havenlaw Domain, he had directly rushed towards the Dragon-Phoenix Mountain Range. But due to the fact that it was situated at the northern part of the Northern Region, with a great distance between it and the Great Havenlaw Domain, he had no idea how many powerful forces’ territories he had to pass through along the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, generally speaking, this journey was rather smooth, in addition to Mu Chen travelling at top speed, he was already gradually approaching the northern area in just two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he gradually got closer, Mu Chen started to sense more and more Spiritual Energy fluctuations making their way towards the same direction. Clearly, they were all making their way towards the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The owners of those Spiritual Energy fluctuations were rather young, with decent strength. However, they did not make Mu Chen too astonished because those that he encountered so far were just almost on par with Xu Qing and Zhou Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not take the initiative to approach those people and had chosen to avoid them instead, choosing deep mountain paths for his journey. Although his speed would be interfered by the Spiritual Beasts residing in those mountains, it was better than having any disputes. It was also quiet and peaceful. Naturally, the main point was that he needed peace in order to continue his study on the Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Night covered the land, with the occasional roars of Spiritual Beasts deep in the mountain, spreading out in the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sparkles of a fire rose in the dense forest as a slender figure quietly sat down with his eyes closed. On his palm, there was a slowly spinning purple flower that was emitting a dark purple light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the dark purple light seemed to be an ancient text that entered his body along his palm. Vaguely, it seemed to outline certain profound runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was naturally Mu Chen who was travelling by himself. During these two days, he had travelled deep into the mountains. Comprehending by himself had also gained him some harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The encirclement of purple light lasted for an hour before it gradually dissipated, then Mu Chen slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the purple flower in his hand and with a flip of his palm, he stored it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s indeed profound… Even if I can comprehend the profundities in the divine runes of the Primordial Mandala Flower in the Immortal Page, I have only managed to touch the very superficial points of it.” Mu Chen inwardly sighed. This Mandala Heavens Annihilation Light was indeed worthy of being a Perfect Rank Divine Art. The difficulty of cultivating it even made him feel a headache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly spat out a mouthful of air as he suppressed the thoughts in his heart and was intending to go into a cultivation state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was about to cultivate, his expression suddenly changed and he extinguished the flames before him with a wave of his hand. Furthermore, his figure had flown out in the darkness like a civet, vigorously shuttling in the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Patches of forest flashed before his eyes and, a long while later, Mu Chen quietly landed on a huge lush tree. He then separated the leaves and looked up ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he directed his gaze over, his expression couldn’t help freezing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the forest was a clear lake with the round moon hanging high in the sky, pouring down its moonlight, which cast a veil of silver on the lake. But what left Mu Chen stunned wasn’t the scenery of this lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the lake, there was a snow-white naked body gracefully taking a bath. Her hair, which seemed like a waterfall, was spread out on the surface of the water. Because of the angle, Mu Chen could only see half of her face. It was that half that involuntarily made Mu Chen, who was used to seeing beauties, take a breath back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had arched brows, a pointed nose, rosy lips, as well as eyes that seemed like two pieces of obsidian under her slender eyelashes. There was also a layer of gloss on her snow-white skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help shifting his eyes down. He saw her snow-white neck that was as graceful as a swan, and an exquisite collarbone, which was slim and alluring. Further down was blocked by the clear lake but vaguely, he could see the ample curves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of beauty, this lady could be in the Top 3 of ladies that Mu Chen had seen so far. According to his thoughts, even Hong Yu of the Demon Gate, whose beauty was unparalleled in the Northern Region would not surpass her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Splashes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen was looking at the lady, the lake water behind her suddenly splashed. A smear of seven colours flashed past, and in the next instant, the lake water exploded as a seven-coloured huge snake charged out and pounced towards the lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Mu Chen’s face instantly, slightly changed as he nearly charged out by reflex. But in the next moment, his figure abruptly stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he saw the lady in the lake lightly chuckle. Her chuckles were like pearls dropping onto a silver plate, it was clear and crisp. She waved her hand and the seven-coloured huge snake swiftly shrunk in size, into the size of a palm, and coiled around her delicate shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this seven-coloured snake was her pet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen secretly felt relieved. Just when he was about to quietly leave, a pair of obsidian pupils suddenly shot over from the lake.</span></p>

He flew out over a thousand feet in the blink of an eye. But suddenly, his body turned stiff as he landed on a huge tree. Looking up ahead, he saw a black-robed figure, reclining on a tree branch looking at him with an eye-narrowing smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a youth. He had a delicate and pretty face and the smile on his face was rather warm. But not knowing why, Mu Chen’s body suddenly tensed up upon seeing him. He felt an uncontainable danger from that mysterious black-clothed youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friend… if you run away like this, I will get beaten up.” The black-robed youth scratched his head as he gave Mu Chen a helpless smile, before taking a step forth.</span></p>

Instantly, the Spiritual Energy in his body stopped circulating.</span></p>

That fellow definitely wasn’t as young as he looked on the surface.</span></p>

When he appeared next, he was already at the edge of the lake, before he let go of Mu Chen.</span></p>

Just when he was about to speak, a lady dressed in a light-coloured dress was walking barefooted on the surface of the lake, before stopping in front of Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen thoroughly saw the lady before him. No, she should be a girl instead. She clearly had a young age, but she had a natural charm emitting from the centre of her brows. The tenderness of the girl combined with her charm made her extremely alluring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the girl walked over, the black-robed youth, who revealed a horrifying strength, immediately had a fawning smile on his face as he ran over with a long face. “Big Sister, I was just helping you chase the nearby Spiritual Beasts away when this kid got in. You can’t blame it on me for not guarding you well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was taken aback. Such a young-looking girl was actually the big sister of that youth with terrifying strength? But the Spiritual Energy fluctuations around this girl before him didn’t seem to be much stronger than his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl gave the black-robed youth a cold stare with her alluring eyes, before looking at Mu Chen. The seven-coloured snake crawled over her shoulder, while it stuck its tongue out at Mu Chen.</span></p>

Just when he was about to speak, the girl stretched her hand out and her clear and crisp voice resounded in the night, which petrified Mu Chen on the spot.</span></p>
