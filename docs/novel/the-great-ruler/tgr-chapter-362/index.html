 <p><strong>Chapter 362 - Ferocious Couple</strong></p>
 <p>The spiritual mist prevaded across this stretch of the world. However, on top of a mountain peak, the spiritual mist had dissipated within a radius of thousands of metres. Four figures were standing in the air within it, with boundless Spiritual Energy radiating from them, causing the spiritual mist that permeated this stretch of the world to be unable to get close to them.</p>
 <p>The faces of Mao Jiang and Chi Yu had become extremely dark at this moment. Originally, they assumed that they had gotten their hands on some easy targets. However, all of a sudden, the lambs had turned into vicious wolves, and it was them that was forced to a slightly miserable state.</p>
 <p>“If you’re starting to regret it, I’m afraid it's slightly too late.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen stared chillingly towards Mao Jiang as black lightning flashed around his body. Under his clothing, a lightning rune started to slowly surface, while an erratic, strong and powerful energy rose within his body like a furious dragon.</p>
 <p>“Regret? A Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase dares to say such words to us? When we were running amok in the Northern Heavens Continent, your hair hadn’t even grown out yet!” Mao Jiang roared as he laughed in fury.</p>
 <p>“Oh really?”</p>
 <p>The smile at the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth grew increasingly sinister and cold as black lightning surfaced within his eyes. Taking a step forward, he appeared before Mao Jiang like a spectre. A fist of wind howled out, covered by Spiritual Energy that was burning with black flames, while encased with bits of black lightning. In an incomparably rampaging fashion, it violently rumbled out.</p>
 <p>Mao Jiang’s gaze was sinister and dark as Spiritual Energy erupted from his body without a shred of restraint. Transforming into shadow pikes, they explosively shot out. He truly didn’t believe that he, with his strength at Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase, would actually be unable to suppress that Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase brat!</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>The two people confronted each other across the horizon. Spiritual Energy crazily wrecked havoc in their surroundings, causing even the surrounding space to faintly distort. The violent storm that swept out caused the Spiritual Energy to completely split apart and dissipate.</p>
 <p>While Mu Chen and Mao Jiang were confronting each other, Luo Li pointed with her sword tip. In the next instant, the river of Sword Aura gushed out. Carrying along the extremely sharp Sword Aura, it enveloped over the dark-faced Chi Yu.</p>
 <p>“Hmph.”</p>
 <p>Chi Yu’s gaze grew increasingly dark and cold as scarlet-red Spiritual Energy swept out of his body akin to flames. Forming a hand seal, the scarlet-red Spiritual Energy condensed together, transforming into countless scarlet-red daggers.</p>
 <p>These daggers sparkled with a chilling glint that caused people’s hearts to palpitate. In the next moment, bringing his hand down, they transformed into a light rain that blotted the skies, hiding the skies and covering the earth as they rumbled towards the river of Sword Aura.</p>
 <p>Scree! Scree!</p>
 <p>As they collided in the air, the countless scarlet-red light rain dissipated the moment they made contact with the river of Sword Aura. The swiftness and fierceness of the Sword Aura had far exceeded the expectations of Chi Yu.</p>
 <p>After completely shattering the scarlet-red light rain apart, the remnant river of Sword Aura swept across the Chi Yu.</p>
 <p>Chi Yu was forced to miserably retreat. Regardless of that, his waist and abdomen had been swept across by the river of sword Aura. A malevolent-looking bloody wound surfaced as blood dripped from it.</p>
 <p>“You bitch! You’re looking to die!”</p>
 <p>Chi Yu’s fury had reached its peak. With a clench of his hand, ten scarlet streaks of light shot from within him, before transforming into ten short swords that seemed as if they were condensed from lava.</p>
 <p>These ten short swords continuously dripped with lava, while extremely scorching-hot fluctuations radiated from them, appearing rather astonishing.</p>
 <p>Obviously, these ten short swords were all Spiritual Weapons. Furthermore, they were a complete set of Spiritual Weapons. Although, when alone, they were considered to be Middle-grade Spiritual Weapons, when converged together, their might was comparable to High-grade Spiritual Weapons.</p>
 <p>“Scarlet Dragon Entangling Death!”</p>
 <p>As Chi Yu flicked his ten fingers in succession, the ten short swords instantly transformed into ten scarlet pythons, howling as they shout out. Moving craftily, they shot across the horizon. Bringing about vicious trajectories, they bit down towards Luo Li.</p>
 <p>Facing the incoming bites from the scarlet pythons, Luo Li remained calm and collected. Sword Aura rippled from her body, before forming a Sword Aura defense around it, completely receiving all of the rampaging attacks against her.</p>
 <p>The two battlegrounds in the sky had erupted into intense fights at this moment.</p>
 <p>However, as time continued to elapse, Chi Yu and Mao Jiang’s gazes grew increasingly dark as they gradually felt the pressure building up on them. The youth and the young girl in front of them were releasing strength that caused even their hearts to palpitate.</p>
 <p>They were starting to feel unease erupting, bit by bit, within their hearts. If this continued, they might gradually end up in a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>They had to deal with these two people as fast as possible. If this dragged on, it might be extremely unfavorable for them.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, an ominous glint flashed within the eyes of Chi Yu and Mao Jiang.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The long pike in Mao Jiang’s hand violently collided against Mu Chen’s fist of wind, causing gales to sweep out. Taking advantage of this, Mao Jiang explosively retreated. While doing so, his eyes started become reeked in a blood-red colour.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Erratic Spiritual Energy erupted from him like a storm, undulating in this stretch of the world. As his hand seals started to rapidly change, the torrential Spiritual Energy condensed in the sky. Faintly, it appeared akin to a black stone pike that seemed to bridge the gap between heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>The stone pike was very simple and unadorned, while strange vein-like patterns covered its entire surface. In the next moment, boundless and ancient fluctuations radiated from it, causing it to appear as if it could pierce through the heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this spectacle unfolding in front of him, Mu Chen’s eyes faintly narrowed. This Mao Jing was obviously displaying an extremely formidable offensive Deity Tier Spiritual Art.</p>
 <p>“Die, brat!”</p>
 <p>A mouthful of blood essence spurted out from Mao Jiang’s mouth, before landing on the surface of the stone pike. Instantly, the colour of the stone pike became dark, while a baleful aura was faintly discernable as it started to pervade out.</p>
 <p>“Blood God’s Heavenly Fighting Pike!”</p>
 <p>An explosive roar rang out from Mao Jiang as the gigantic pike rushed towards the sky. Transforming into torrential rays of bloody light, they dived down from the sky. The ground below instantly collapsed, while a fissure even formed in the surrounding space.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Mu Chen looked towards the descending stone pike that contained a frightening power. In the next instant, his hand suddenly turned illusionary as a starry sky condensed behind him. Along with ancient roars, three gigantic beastial figures condensed from it.</p>
 <p>The three great divine seals of the Four Gods Constellation Scripture had once again been displayed by Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Following his increase in strength, the might of the three great divine seals was even more so than a month ago.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Three gigantic beastial figures roared as they flew across the sky. Transforming into three different coloured streaks of light, they intertwined as they explosively shot out. In the next instant, carrying along torrential amounts of Spiritual Energy, they furiously smashed against the gigantic stone pike pressing down from above!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>An incomparably erratic Spiritual Energy storm spread out, causing the mountain peaks below to shatter and collapse as it swept through them, leading to gigantic cracks spreading in all directions.</p>
 <p>Mao Jiang tightly stared at the origin of the erratic Spiritual Energy storm. After quite a while, the storm gradually came to a stop. However, Mu Chen’s figure had disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>“He’s been shattered into pieces?”</p>
 <p>As Mao Jiang swept his gaze around, happiness erupted within his eyes. This move of his was a killing one, and that Mu Chen had actually dared to meet it head-on. This goes to show how reckless he truly was.</p>
 <p>“It hasn’t end, yet. What are you so happy about?!”</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, just as happiness had appeared within his eyes, a ridiculing voice filled with cold laughter suddenly rang out in the air. The expression on Mao Jiang’s face instantly changed as he hastily looked up, only to see that Mu Chen’s figure had unknowingly appeared high up in the sky. At this moment, a gigantic black pagoda had appeared behind Mu Chen. It had nine levels on its body, while boundless energy radiated from it.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see who will be the one that suppresses the other!”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen sneered, while the nine-layered pagoda instantly erupted with thousands of brilliant rays of light. The surface of the pagoda, level by level, started to sparkle and, very quickly, brilliant rays of light had already permeated the fourth level.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Golden runes surfaced on the body of the pagoda, before four golden dragons roared as they separated from the pagoda, twisting and twining as they circled the pagoda. In the past, when Mu Chen activated the Nine-layered pagoda, he could only activate two of its levels. However, with the increase of his strength, now, he was already able to activate four levels.</p>
 <p>“Suppress for me!”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen patted down with his large hand. Instantly, carrying along the four golden dragons twisting and roaring around it, the Nine-layered pagoda brought along its gigantic shadow as it pressed down on Mao Jiang, whose expression had instantaneously changed.</p>
 <p>“Ten Thousand Pike Divine Art!”</p>
 <p>Mao Jiang explosively roared, only to have ten thousand black glowing pikes surface in the air. In the next instant, hiding the skies and covering the earth, they shot straight towards the black pagoda.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>However, the Nine-Layered pagoda didn't give a single care towards the incoming attacks. In an overbearing manner, it pressed down, while countless glowing pikes shattered, simply unable to create any obstruction to it.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Within a few breaths, the Nine-Layered pagoda had shattered all the glowing pikes that blotted the skies apart. Under the aghast and horror-filled gaze of Mao Jiang, it violently smashed against the boundless Spiritual Energy defenses around his body.</p>
 <p>Crack!</p>
 <p>Mao Jiang’s face instantly turned pale as a mouthful of blood crazily spurted out. His body rapidly descended, smashing through the mountain peak below, causing it to sink in.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>However, just as Mao Jiang was about to get buried by the countless rocks formed around him, he fled out of there in an extremely miserable state. At this moment, his body was covered in blood, his face deathly pale, while his eyes were overwhelmed with shock.</p>
 <p>The previous attack by Mu Chen had caused serious injuries to him. Furthermore, he was able to sense that when the black pagoda had pressed down on him, the Spiritual Energy within his body had turned sluggish, as if it had been sealed up.</p>
 <p>“This brat’s very strange!”</p>
 <p>An intense tremble shook Mao Jiang’s mind as he already had the intent to flee. At this moment, if he didn’t leave, he might truly be killed by Mu Chen at this place.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Just as this thought flashed within his mind, his figure had already shot out at lightning speed. As long as he could enter the area of the spiritual mist, it would be very easy for him to escape.</p>
 <p>In the air, upon spotting Mao Jiang, who was explosively shooting out, a sneer flashed within Mu Chen’s eyes as his hand seal changed.</p>
 <p>Mao Jiang was now only a hundred feet away from the spiritual mist. However, at the instant when he was able to rush into it, the spiritual mist in front of him suddenly started to intensely fluctuate. As the spiritual mist dissipated away, two gigantic Spiritual Arrays came into view.</p>
 <p>As the Spiritual Arrays revolved, Spiritual Energy swept out. Two streaks of light explosively shot out, violently impacting against Mao Jiang, who was totally caught unprepared.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>His body flew out, once again, with shock and horror completely filling his eyes. Those Spiritual Arrays, exactly when were they arranged within the spiritual mist?</p>
 <p>His body heavily shot into the mountain, while his aura was instantly depressed. Crazily spurting blood, his chest had already caved in as he looked incredulously at Mu Chen, who was slowly descending from the sky. With a wave of the latter’s sleeve, the Spiritual Arrays in the distance started to dissipate.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked with an apathetic gaze at Mao Jiang, who was now in a seriously-injured state. With a clench of his hand, a black pike dropped within. Breaking it into four pieces, with a flick of his finger, four black rays of light violently shot towards the Mao Jiang’s four limbs, viciously pinning him to the mountain, causing him to be unable to move or free himself.</p>
 <p>“Arghhhh!”</p>
 <p>Miserable shrieks rang out from Mao Jiang due to the intense pain coming from his four limbs, while thick dread and terror erupted from his eyes. The youth in front of him was too vicious and cruel in his actions.</p>
 <p>In the sky, after hearing the miserable shriek, a shiver went through Chi Yu’s heart, who was entangled with Luo Li. He hastily looked over, only to see Mao Jiang pinned to the mountain by Mu Chen. Instantly, horror and dread erupted from his eyes.</p>
 <p>How could that brat be so formidable?!</p>
 <p>“Hurry up and flee!”</p>
 <p>Chi Yu’s fighting spirit was instantly doused. He already knew that their hunt had failed. If he didn’t flee now, he would have the same ending as Mao Jiang.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>Making a prompt decision, his body abruptly retreated. At the same time, the the lava-like short swords transformed into scarlet pythons, once again, crazily sending their attacks towards Luo Li in an attempt to restrain her.</p>
 <p>A chilling glint appeared in Luo Li’s clear and limpid eyes as she stared at the retreating Chi Yu. As her jade-like hand slowly clenched the longsword within, her slender finger made a flick. Instantly, her sword scabbard flew out, causing chilling light to appear. Due to this, the temperature of this stretch of the world had also suddenly dropped down.</p>
 <p>Holding the longsword in her hand, slowed her sleep down, while gently slashing downwards.</p>
 <p>Scree! Scree!</p>
 <p>At the instant when her sword edge slashed down, the space in front of her was split apart. The ten scarlet pythons heading towards her instantly froze as a sword light flashed past their bodies, causing them the split into two halves.</p>
 <p>Crack!</p>
 <p>The ten lava-like short swords that were chopped apart dropped down from the sky, their Spiritual Energy totally dissipated. This set of High-grade Spiritual Artifacts were unexpectedly destroyed with a single slash from Luo Li.</p>
 <p>Spurt Pfft.</p>
 <p>With his Spiritual Weapons destroyed, Chi Yu had received the backlash from Luo Li’s attack. Causing him to spurt a mouthful of blood. The horror and shock within his eye instantly became thicker. However, just as he was about to increase his speed of retreat, the space behind him shattered. Two rays of sword light swept out, piercing into his shoulders.</p>
 <p>Just like that, his body, which was speeding away, instantly froze.</p>
 <p>Standing in the air, Luo Li extended her jade-like hands. The sword scabbard rushing towards the sky descended down, before her longsword slowly entered her scabbard, emitting a gentle cry.</p>
 <p>Ring!</p>
 <p>At the instant when her longsword entered her scabbard, a mouthful of blood spurted out from Chi Yu. At the same time, his arms slowly slid down from his shoulders, before dropping down; the area sliced by her was as smooth as a mirror.</p>
