 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Ming’s mocking and indifferent gaze shot over, Mu Chen maintained a calm expression and sent his gaze over. At this moment, Bai Ming and the rest were on a huge stone platform and, as expected, the Roc Clan and Nine-Coloured Peacock Clan had also arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from those peak teams, Mu Chen was a little surprised, since there were several other teams here as well. All those teams came from Divine Beast Clans with robust foundations. But the situation for those teams wasn’t looking too good. It was so much so that they even had casualties amongst them. Evidently, they had paid a price when they faced their Eighth Grade Beast Spirits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen swept his gaze out, the teams on the stone platform were also astonished when they looked at Mu Chen. That’s because they realised that there weren’t any casualties in Mu Chen’s team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That meant that Mu Chen’s team did not pay any price when they dealt with their Eighth Grade Beast Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only were those teams astonished, they even had a smear of pity flashing in their eyes. That’s because when Mu Chen used the Lightning-Devouring Beast’s Heart earlier, they could vaguely feel the horrifying fluctuation. Therefore, they had thought that Mu Chen had used it on the Eighth Grade Beast Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That item was initially Mu Chen’s greatest reliance, so Bai Ming’s team did not make a move against them. It was precisely because of the existence of the Lightning-Devouring Beast’s Heart. But after losing that intimidating item, how could he face such a ferocious opponent like Bai Ming?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when they saw that Mu Chen’s team did not have any casualties, they felt more pity in their hearts. Some teams even inwardly shook their heads. Mu Chen was truly overestimating himself, did he really think that Bai Ming was an easy opponent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Bai Ming had the intention to kill, Mu Chen’s entire team might even be buried here. Furthermore, even if the Nine Netherbird Clan knew about this matter, there wasn’t anything that they could do to Bai Ming and could only swallow it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The leader of the Roc Clan, the white-haired man, looked at Mu Chen with interest, since he wished to know if Mu Chen was truly foolish to not fear Bai Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kong Ling of the Nine-Coloured Peacock Clan did not look at Mu Chen during the entire process. When they were outside the God’s Cemetery, the reason why she made a move to obstruct Bai Ming was due to the fact that she did not want Mu Chen and Bai Ming to go all-out, disturbing their entry to the inner section. But since they’re already in the inner section and Mu Chen didn’t seem to know what’s good for him, she naturally wouldn’t be bothered about his life or death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had different emotions in their eyes, but Mu Chen’s expression did not change. He lead Nine Nether and the rest to land on the stone platform as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen, look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen descended onto the platform, Nine Nether suddenly called out with excitement from his rear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen immediately directed his gaze over with Nine Nether and he contracted his eyes. That’s because he saw a stone statue on a stone pagoda that was at the northern part of the altar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That statue had unfolded its wings, covering the sun. It seemed to be a phoenix and yet not at the same time, blazing with flames on its body. The flames seemed to be eternal and undying. Although it was only a stone statue, the ancient pressure emitting from it still caused the blood in his body to turn stagnant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could sense the True Phoenix Spirit on his body wriggling and, vaguely, there was a resounding phoenix cry, filled with familiarity and facing it on the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen deeply puffed out as joy flashed in his eyes. Although he hadn’t seen a Primordial Undying Bird before, he could already be certain with the reaction coming from the True Phoenix Spirit that the statue before him was the Primordial Undying Bird!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like he had not guessed incorrectly. There was an Undying Bird in the God’s Cemetery!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That would mean that there would be the inheritance blood essence of the Undying Bird here as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The excitement in his heart was soon suppressed by Mu Chen, since he could sense that there was a total of three stone statues, not only one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the other two was a massive bird that looked extremely gorgeous. As if it possessed astonishing spirituality that was filled with vitality as it flapped its wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is?” Mu Chen looked at the unfamiliar bird statue and felt somewhat doubtful. Evidently, he couldn’t recognise that state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Primordial Myriad Spiritual Bird, one of the Super Divine Beasts that fell a long time ago.” Nine Nether’s words contained revere as she sighed, “In the ancient times, the Great Thousand World greatly suffered from the invasion of the Fiend Clans. The majority of those powerful yet rare species of Divine Beasts had fallen due to the loss of their inheritance, hence falling to ordinary and becoming normal Spiritual Beast Clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. If that’s the case, then the Fiend Clans were truly the great enemy of the Great Thousand World. It was only a single invasion and it had already caused such great loss to the Great Thousand World. It was so much so that even those clans had gone extinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about the other one?” Mu Chen looked at the last stone statue. It was a huge beast that was roaring towards the sky, as if its figure could support the heavens itself. It was pitch-black with palms as massive as hills that could shatter the land in a myriad mile with a single slam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Primordial Desolate Beast, a top-tiered Divine Beast in ancient times with massive strength and the ability to go berserk. The moment it goes berserk, it's fighting strength would soar. The Barbel Ape Clan also possesses the ability to go berserk and it is said that the ability originates from the Primordial Desolate Beast.” Nine Nether explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like the ancient text wasn’t wrong. In the primordial times, the Divine Beast Origin possessed three Beast Sovereigns and it is said that when the Divine Beast Origin was destroyed, they launched a counterattack that dragged numerous Monarchs of the Fiend Clans along with them, sealing those Monarchs.” Nine Nether looked at the massive altar as she spoke with revere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three Beast Sovereigns…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. Judging from the appearance of those three stone statues, they must’ve been the three. But thereafter, he directed his gaze towards the land around the altar, which was dyed in blood and he lightly knitted his brows. He had suddenly recalled the land where the Treasure Beast fell. The black hole which sucked in the blood essences of the Treasure Beast…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wondered if there was a connection between them, but regardless of anything, it was worth paying attention to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like the teams that should be here have arrived.” While Mu Chen and Nine Nether conversed, Kong Ling of the Nine-Coloured Peacock Clan raised her eyes and faintly said, “Since everyone can reach here, you must have decent strength as well. The inner section is the land where the three Beast Sovereigns fell. It is indeed as you imagined, you can obtain their inheritance blood essences here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment she spoke, aside from those top-tiered teams, who knew about this matter much earlier, the other teams, with Nine Nether’s team included, had their eyes glowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kong Ling briefly paused as she continued, “There are only three inheritance blood essences. Which means that only three people can obtain them. As for the rest, they can only return empty-handed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those teams that were excited felt as if a bucket of water had poured onto their heads. With only three inheritance blood essences, it meant that two out of the five top-tiered teams would return empty-handed, not to mention their teams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen maintained a calm expression. Although he didn’t know the exact information, he could guess that it wouldn’t be easy to obtain an inheritance blood essence. Therefore, he wasn’t optimistic right from the beginning, so he naturally wasn’t too disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Kong Ling finished her words, the stone platform fell silent. Those teams that could make it into the inner section were all with extraordinary strength. Therefore, everyone knew that only the five top-tiered teams could compete for the three inheritance blood essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were unwilling, they were also helpless. Not to mention the formation that five top-tiered teams possessed, just the leaders of their teams alone were all Eighth Grade Sovereigns. Compared to the other experts, they were on an entire level above. Truthfully speaking, just one of them could annihilate one of their teams.</span></p>
