Thus, many people had their eyes set on it, and in just a minute, the price was already raised to around 1700 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jing sat in the chair depressed as she placed her hands on her cheek. Her teeth were clenched as he looked at those fellows intensely snatching it as she spoke with resentment, “If it wasn’t for me leaving in such a hurry, I’d have smashed those fellows to death with Sovereign Spiritual Liquids!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was resting his arm on the armrest as he looked around. He realised that those people that were interested in the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony didn’t seem to be from those significant forces, which could be seen from their bids. Those that were wealthy wouldn’t play around with so little price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This realisation made Mu Chen feel slightly relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The price continued to rise for a few minutes before it stopped at 2300 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing as the bid started to end, the white-robed elderly man waited awhile. He raised his hand and was about to announce the results. At this moment, the white-clothed girl had already turned her face over in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“2500.” Mu Chen finally said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some gazes were shot over, but those gazes were a little strange. Even Lin Jing was baffled as she turned her head around and looked at Mu Chen. She bit her lips and was mumbling about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man that raised the bid to 2300 earlier knitted his brows together. He hesitated for a brief moment and did not bid anymore in the end as the price had far exceeded his budget.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the situation, the white-clothed elder waved his hand, which was followed by a ringing bell that resonated in the auction house, representing that the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony had been successfully bid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The auction carried on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pupils of the white-clothed girl were spinning, her face was a little embarrassed at this moment as she fanned the fan in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not ask why Mu Chen would purchase the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony, since she didn’t want to have wishful thoughts and be embarrassed later on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen held an attitude to watch the show for a long while, seeing that she had actually endured asking, he couldn’t help smiling as he said, “That was indeed for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jing’s face flushed red as she said, “Thanks for that. I am also cultivating my Sovereign Celestial Body, but I need many types of Jade Chalcedony…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Nine Nether took another glance at Lin Jing and a strange light flashed in the depths of her eyes. She had caught onto the words of that girl, about needing many types of Jade Chalcedony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although several Sovereign Celestial Body cultivation techniques did require stuff like the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony, there weren’t many Sovereign Celestial Bodies that needed many types of Jade Chalcedony. Take the 63rd ranking of the 99 Ranks of Sovereign Celestial Bodies, the Heavenly Jade Celestial Body, for example. This was a Sovereign Celestial Body that required many types of Jade Chalcedonies as ingredients, and the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony was just one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lin Jing was genuinely making preparations to cultivate the Heavenly Jade Celestial Body, then her background would be frightening. Even for Seventh to Eighth Grade Sovereign experts, such a Sovereign Celestial Body rank was extremely attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, although the Heavenly Jade Celestial Body wasn’t a high-ranking powerful Celestial Body, it was perfect for those who had just stepped into the Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Sovereign Celestial Body was too powerful, it would naturally be tough to control it; whereas if it were too weak, I would be useless. Thus, her family members had typically carefully considered everything before letting her cultivate the Heavenly Jade Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not consider it as much as Nine Nether; after all, he wasn’t too familiar with Sovereign Celestial Bodies. On the spot, he asked from little curiosity, “Your family members did not prepare the ingredients for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl before him clearly had a decent background. Although the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony was rare, it shouldn’t be difficult for her to obtain it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to depend on myself. How meaningless would it be if I needed them to prepare everything for me?” Lin Jing dragged on her cheek as she spoke while shaking her long legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, I’ve said that I would not owe anyone favours.” Lin Jing seemed to have recalled something as she retrieved a jade pendant hug on a red string from her neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade was white in colour, and looked as if there was liquid flowing in it. In general, it had an extremely aged appearance, but vaguely, indescribable fluctuations were coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a Defensive Spiritual Jade. It will be activated when you’re in danger. As long as the opponent’s strength doesn’t exceed the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm, it will be able to block a fatal attack for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether were stunned, their expressions slightly changed. It could defend against a fatal attack from a Fifth Grade Sovereign, that simple and old pendant was actually so powerful?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it, it was prepared for you by your family. I will not seize the loved possession of others.” Mu Chen shook his head in the end as he smiled, “Furthermore, I’m afraid that the price of this Defensive Spiritual Jade far surpasses the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No way, if you don’t want this, I will not take that Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony.” However, Lin Jing was abnormally stubborn. She was looking at Mu Chen with a serious look, she was clearly not joking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That girl similarly had her own principles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Also, you don’t have to worry about me. I still have more Defensive Spiritual Jades. Otherwise, I wouldn’t dare to sneak out.” Lin Jing gave Mu Chen a sly smile as she raised her wrist at Mu Chen. On her wrist, there was a small and old Jade Pendant hung on her pearly-white wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was speechless as he sighed in the end. Kids from wealthy families truly were fortunate, they could even wear such precious Defensive Spiritual Jades on their bodies. This made him feel naked. if it weren’t for the Spiritual Condensing Bowl that he managed to obtain with luck, he wouldn’t even have any money to enter this place…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Here.” Lin Jing handed the Defensive Spiritual Jade over to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So in the end, it was me that benefitted from this.” Mu Chen bitterly smiled. He did not reject any further and extended his hand to take the Defensive Spiritual Jade as he sighed with complicated feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to sigh. Mu Chen, you’re indeed a friend!” Lin Jing smiled as she gave Mu Chen a thumbs-up. Her thumb was as round as a pearl, it was cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, Mu Chen bidding the Heavenly Flame Jade Chalcedony for her earlier raised some good feelings in Lin Jing’s heart. After all, not just anyone would spend over 2000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids for an item that they wouldn’t need after knowing them for such a short time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, she was intelligent and had sensed that Mu Chen wasn’t someone that could disregard 2000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids. This was the main reason why it was hard to be valued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she was young, her experience far surpassed Mu Chen’s imagination. She wasn’t someone lacking in insight.</span></p>
