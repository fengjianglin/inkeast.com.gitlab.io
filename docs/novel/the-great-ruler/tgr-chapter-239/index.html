 <p><strong>Chapter 239 - Fire Spirit Lotus</strong></p>
 <p>The light gathered on the surface of the clear lake. When the figure of light appeared with his white dragon spiraling around him, the atmosphere around the White Dragon Hillock finally exploded.</p>
 <p>Countless eyes turned red and their breaths turned heavy as they stared at the illusory light spirit. A look of intense delight welled up in their eyes.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Treasury appearing this time was actually the Sovereign Spirit Treasury!</p>
 <p>When they’d first arrived in the area, they’d only heard a few rumors about the Sovereign Spirit Treasury. No one was certain that the Spirit Treasury emerging this time would actually be the one left behind by the White Dragon Sovereign. They’d been trying their luck by coming here and their bets had finally paid off.</p>
 <p>Lips were licked. So, it was a Sovereign Spirit Treasury. If the news spread, some true major forces might even be moved to action. But luckily, the news hadn’t spread so rapidly this time. By the time a few of the major forces receive the news, the Sovereign Spirit Treasury would be cleaned out.</p>
 <p>“It really is the White Dragon Sovereign.” Bai Dong’s eyes also turned red as he watched the light spirit. His dark eyes stared out from among the white-robed figures. A trace of excitement flashed across his eyes.</p>
 <p>“That’s the White Dragon Sovereign?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen also watched with a curious expression. It was impossible to get a clear glimpse of the light spirit’s features, but the dragon still spiraled with a fleeting, yet intimidating, demeanor that rippled between heaven and earth. It was a sight that struck fear and awe into the hearts of any who saw it.</p>
 <p>“Onom.”</p>
 <p>The illusionary White Dragon Sovereign raised his hand and the white dragon roared. A burst of myriad color erupted like the burning sun and rose over the lake. The water instantly frothed and boiled.</p>
 <p>Shuu! Shhhuu!</p>
 <p>Five colors were shining brighter than any others and shot towards the five mountain pillars.</p>
 <p>Chiii!</p>
 <p>Each pillar of light touched one of the Milky Way waterfalls and split them open. The colors illuminated the cliff faces behind the waterfalls.</p>
 <p>Kachaa!</p>
 <p>The cliff faces tumbled down, one massive stone after another, revealing five huge seals to the eyes of the observers.</p>
 <p>“Thats…”</p>
 <p>Everyone stared at the seals in shock.</p>
 <p>“Onom.”</p>
 <p>The five ancient seals glowed with brilliant light and left their cliff faces like living creatures and gathered above the lake.</p>
 <p>“Roarr!”</p>
 <p>The moment the five seals gathered, the white dragon lifted its muzzle, roared towards the sky, and charged into the seals. There was a flash of light and the space began to distort, turning into a vortex of light a few dozen feet wide.</p>
 <p>Shuuuuu!</p>
 <p>Another beam of light rushed out from the vortex and into the sky, bearing the image of a huge white dragon. The roars of dragons echoed for hundreds of miles. It was truly a spectacular sight to anyone in the White Dragon Hillock.</p>
 <p>“The Sovereign Spirit Treasury has appeared!”</p>
 <p>Everyone’s heartbeats quickened. The Sovereign Spirit Treasury that’d been hidden for several hundred years had finally appeared!</p>
 <p>“Charge!”</p>
 <p>Someone shouted. Then countless figures rose up and rushed like locusts towards the vortex.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s dark pupils burned with excitement as well; he was very interested in the rumored Sovereign Spirit Treasury. He wanted to take the opportunity to make himself even stronger.</p>
 <p>Thanks to Li Xuantong, he knew little more about Luo Li and her Luo God Clan. More importantly, he knew that he needed to become even stronger. That was the only way he could help Luo Li, so that she wouldn’t have to bear the burden of saving millions upon millions of her clansmen. And to have her sink into despair while he helplessly watched.</p>
 <p>However, he was still too weak. Even Li Xuantong could easily beat him. He had to grow stronger.</p>
 <p>On the roof of that small building, the young boy had told the young girl that he would become a supreme expert.</p>
 <p>He still had a long way to go before he got there. But luckily, there was still time for him to grow.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked up and took in a deep breath of chilly air. Something reflected in his black pupils. His voice rumbled deep and low with resoluteness that couldn’t be heard. His road would be hard, but in this world, there was still something that he was willing to chase after, even if it required him to give everything he could.</p>
 <p>Su Xuan also nodded as she reminded, “Be cautious. A Sovereign Spirit Treasury is no less dangerous than a dragon’s pool or a tiger’s cave. It won’t be easy to obtain the treasures the Sovereign left behind.”</p>
 <p>She lightly inhaled a breath of air, then became the first to move out. Counting Mu Chen and the other three, the four streaks of light entered the earth-shaking mass of bodies that flowed towards the huge glowing portal.</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Chen entered the portal, he felt his surroundings ripple with chaos. His vision blacked out for a moment, then returned. At the same time, a surge of heat blew directly on his face.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen opened his eyes with an expression of astonishment. Before him was a vast lake of magma and he was standing on a platform in the middle of it all. Flashes of light continued at regular intervals as one figure after another materialised on the platform.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen swept his eyes around the island and suddenly realised that all of his party members were missing.</p>
 <p>“Were we separated by the portal’s space ripples?” Mu Chen frowned. This Sovereign Spirit Treasury was indeed worthy of its name. This was a man-made dimension. He was shocked by just thinking about how it could’ve been created. However, Mu Chen knew that one would have to be exceptionally powerful to open a space in a place such as the Great Thousand World.</p>
 <p>Even a Heavenly Completion Stage expert wouldn’t be able to accomplish that.</p>
 <p>The Great Thousand World was a place where a host of other planes intersected, and as a result, the stability of this place was far greater than average. Experts who were powerful enough to tear apart space in the Lower Planes wouldn’t make so much as a crack in the Great Thousand World. And if an expert from the Great Thousand World ever visited a Lower Plane, they’d easily cause a major disaster.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen shook his head. It looked like they’d been temporarily separated; however, they’d probably run across each other, sooner or later. They were strong enough, as long as they didn’t encounter any peculiar troubles. But, right now, he had to take care of himself, first.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked around. The stone platform he stood on wasn’t the only one in this gigantic lake of magma. The sounds of a commotion drifted from somewhere far away.</p>
 <p>“I should leave this place, first.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen took two steps forward and his line of sight was drawn to the other end of the magma lake. That place should be connected to the depths of the Spirit Treasury.</p>
 <p>“Hmm? What’s that?”</p>
 <p>Just when Mu Chen was about to skim off, a few cries of surprise sounded from his stone platform.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was alerted by those cries and his eyes snapped back to the source. A fiery-red lotus was blooming on the surface of magma. The center of the flower blazed with flames and within those flames were more thumb-size lotuses of fire.</p>
 <p>Ripples of astonishing Spiritual Energy fluctuated throughout the space. The air itself felt like it was on fire.</p>
 <p>“That’s…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked at the floating fiery-red lotus and, at first, drew a blank. Then, he recognised it and asked, “Is that the Fire Spirit Lotus?”</p>
 <p>The Fire Spirit Lotus was an extremely rare treasure. Its seeds were formed from the purest Flame Spiritual Energy that could be found between the heavens and earth. It possessed a god-level effect for refining the physique and also had great benefits towards cultivation.</p>
 <p>Even in the auction house, the price of such a treasure wouldn’t be low. But, right now, there were so many of them floating on the magma lake.</p>
 <p>“That’s the Fire Spirit Lotus?!!”</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen identified the burning lotus blossoms, a surge of surprised cries burst out from the experts around him. A heavy feeling of greed settled within countless pairs of eyes. Never could they have imagined such wealth just after entering the Spirit Treasury. The Sovereign Spirit Treasury was, indeed, worthy of its name.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen licked his lips as he swept his eyes over the vast lake of magma. His heart jumped at seeing so many Fire Spirit Lotuses.</p>
 <p>As far as he knew, it was rare to find Fire Spirit Lotuses growing in such large clumps. But, if they did, then there was a chance that another rare treasure would be born.</p>
 <p>The Fire Celestial Lotus.</p>
 <p>It was an evolved form of the Fire Spirit Lotus. It could greatly enhance the progress of those who cultivated fire attribute Spiritual Arts. Although Mu Chen didn’t cultivate that particular aspect, it’d be a great benefit to the Nine Netherflames that he’d merged with.</p>
 <p>“There are so many Fire Spirit Lotuses growing in this place, so there must be one that’s succeeded in its evolution!”</p>
 <p>A look of determination flashed through Mu Chen’s eyes. Just as he was prepared to leap, a loud laugh burst out from someone behind him. Then, a figure leaped before him, heading directly towards one of the Fire Spirit Lotuses.</p>
 <p>“Haha! So many Fire Spirit Lotuses! What luck!”</p>
 <p>The figure was heading directly towards the Fire Spirit Lotus. Mu Chen narrowed his eyes.</p>
 <p>Rustle</p>
 <p>The figure landed on top of the Fire Spirit Lotus and clutched at it while laughing. However, the moment he prepared to pluck it, the magma underneath him burst upwards and a scarlet shadow twisted itself around his legs. With a violent jerk, he was dragged into the magma.</p>
 <p>“Arghhhhh!”</p>
 <p>He cried mournfully. A green smoke rose from the spot he’d disappeared.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen, and any others who’d been ready to act, instantly recalculated with different expressions on their faces. So there was such vicious creatures lurking under the magma?</p>
