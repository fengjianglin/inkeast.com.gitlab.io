 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beyond the thundercloud stage, space rippled as countless streaks of light flew by like comets, the scene was extremely gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single one of those light streaks were drops of Lightning Essence, they were also the source of their greedy eyes. In ancient times, it was said that many Divine Beasts used the Lightning Essence to refine their physiques in cultivation. Making their bodies as tough as diamonds that couldn’t be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lightning Essence wasn’t common. In the current Great Thousand World, despite the fact that there were still many Lightning Essences available in those large-scaled auctions, the prices were extremely steep. The moment one appeared, the price would stir up, which made it hard for ordinary people to purchase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, they had appeared before their eyes and there was a countless amount of them. So how could they not feel the surge in their hearts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So this is the fortune for those that obtained the five quotas…” Mu Chen licked his lips. If he could successfully make it through this space and go through the baptism of countless Lightning Essences, it would simply be an unimaginable refinement for the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Body Refining Pagoda was truly filled with opportunities to refine the physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was merely half a day’s time since they entered the Body Refining Pagoda and the improvement he had to his physique was something that couldn’t be compared to even if he had cultivated for a year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s no wonder why the Divine Beast Origin would be filled with so many experts back then, occupying a third of the Divine Beast Continent…” Mu Chen sighed. With such an exceptional cultivation condition, it was no wonder why the number of experts in the Divine Beast Origin was extremely high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Mu Chen sighed, the lightning mats beneath them suddenly vibrated and slowly flew out, carrying them, and they entered the space that was filled with the countless comets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and the rest saw this, their hearts trembled and they adjusted their condition with blazing gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the five lightning mats brought the five of them into the space, streaks of light flew in every direction, which made the five’s eyes turn red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Shan was the quickest. He formed a claw with his hand and made a grabbing motion. A suction force suddenly exploded that fixed onto a streak of light and forcefully pulled it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The targeted streak of light had changed direction and it flew over like a comet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Shan grinned and opened his arms without using any Spiritual Energy, since he knew that it was impossible for Spiritual Energy to make contact with the Lightning Essence. In the world, there was only one thing that could hold it, a body of flesh and blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, if he wanted to absorb the lightning essence, then he would have to receive it with his own physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streak of light slammed against Han Shan’s chest, issuing a deep and low noise as a bloody hole appeared on Han Shan’s chest. Lightning could be seen flickering in the wound and traces of lightning liquid swiftly integrated with his body through the hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Shan’s face had instantly turned distorted. He was clearly bearing intense pain. As the Lightning Essence entered his body, it would slowly melt and refine his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Shan’s face remained distorted for a long time, before the expression gradually disappeared. When he opened his eyes, his body was covered in sweat and the blazing greed in his eyes had dimmed down by quite a bit, and was replaced with fear. Clearly, the pain brought by the Lightning Essence refining the body wasn’t something an ordinary person could endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A genius like Han Shan naturally had an extraordinary will power as well. But even so, he only dared to continue pulling Lightning Essence after a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Mu Chen, Mo Feng and the other two had also tried to absorb the Lightning Essence. In the end, all of them had the same reaction as Han Shan, all of their faces were distorted with pain and their bodies were constantly trembling when the Lightning Essence entered their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the intense pain, Mo Feng and the rest all had fear on their faces, only Mu Chen was the exception. When he opened his eyes, his black pupils flashed with a strange light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lowered his head and look at his chest. The bloody hole was swiftly recovering at this moment and his skin was vaguely flickering with a silvery light in that region, it was the changes brought by the Lightning Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could clearly sense that the spot on his body that had absorbed the lightning essence was more solid and powerful than the other parts of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what left Mu Chen pondering wasn’t the effect. But when the Lightning Essence entered his body, he could clearly sense that the majority of the energy from the Lightning Essence had been absorbed by the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos beneath his skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at his arms, where the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos still remained. Vaguely, he could sense that the current True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos seemed extremely active, with a thirst spreading out. If Mu Chen had guessed correctly, they’re thirsty for the energy of the Lightning Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What an appetite…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen muttered in his heart. He had finally experienced how difficult it was to cultivate the Dragon-Phoenix Sutra. That’s because he had never slacked since he had started cultivating it. Even with so many resources poured into it, he had still not reached the second level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Mu Chen’s estimations, if he couldn’t get a breakthrough in the Body Refining Pagoda, he might need another year’s time, which was clearly unacceptable for Mu him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, what he lacked the most was time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, since there were so many resources before his eyes, he couldn’t watch them being wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought about it, Mu Chen no longer hesitated and his eyes flashed with resolution. With a will of his heart, Spiritual Energy surged and formed into a powerful suction force that pulled all the nearby streaks of light over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In such a short period of time, there were nearly ten streaks of light that flew over, all of them rumbled with drops of Lightning Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the surroundings, the other four were greatly shocked by Mu Chen’s move and they immediately pulled themselves away, fearing to be swept in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were extremely clear of the pain that was brought by absorbing the Lightning Essences. Therefore, it was best if they could take it slow. If they were to rush it, their bodies might be the first thing that couldn’t take it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, the Lightning Essences would be too powerful and their bodies would be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the streaks of light flew, they were like cannonballs as they bombarded against Mu Chen’s body. Immediately, bloody holes appeared on his body, instantly making him a blurry, bloody figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As fresh blood flowed, those silvery Lightning Essences fused into his body and the intense pain had instantly caused Mu Chen’s eyes to turn red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gnashing his teeth with beads of sweat flowing down his face, Mu Chen’s face was distorted and a painful deep roar resounded from his throat, which sounded like a wild beast.</span></p>

Immediately, a dragon roar and phoenix cry resounded from Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>

If the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos did not make their moves, then he could only let go of this opportunity.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen opened both of his eyes and a silver light flickered in his pupils, before his mutilated body swiftly recovered with a faint silvery light on his skin, which had grown stronger through the refinement.</span></p>

If they were in Mu Chen’s shoes, they would be suffering heavy consequences by now. So how did Mu Chen recover so swiftly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is that fellow’s physique more powerful than ours?!” Xu Kun felt that it was a little hard to believe. They’re Divine Beasts with powerful innate physiques. So how could a mere human like Mu Chen surpass their physiques?</span></p>

His head was lowered towards his arms. Not only did the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos become more vivid, the golden lustre also grew even more brilliant and the piercing dragon scales and phoenix wings were emitting traces of powerful might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That feeling was as if his tattoos was about to come to life.</span></p>

Therefore, if they wanted to obtain more from the baptism of the Lightning Essences, then they would have to complete it before the mats reached their destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other four knew about this, so their eyes had turned red when they saw Mu Chen frantically absorbing the Lightning Essences. Right now, they were like hungry ghosts with a feast laid before them. They were clearly famished to the point that their chests were sticking to their backs, but they had to eat slowly. Whereas for Mu Chen, he was sweeping the food no matter what was laid before him, eat first and speak second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the delicacies on the table were swiftly entering Mu Chen’s stomach.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The price for raising speed was naturally the painful shrieks and wails…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard those roars, the corner of his lips lifted, before he shut his eyes and spread his arms wide. Then the Spiritual Energy in his body surged with a suction force exploding forth. Instantly, the streaks in the surroundings seemed like they had encountered a magnet as they whistled over towards Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw Mu Chen increasing his suction force, the other four that were painfully howling instantly had their eyelids twitch and they couldn’t help cursing in low voices.</span></p>
