Affected by the killing intent, the temperature between the heavens and earth had abruptly dropped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the killing intent of two Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Nine Nether and the Blood Hawk King faced off, both with icy expressions. The grudges between those two went way back, and neither party found the other party pleasing to the eye. If it wasn’t for the fact that the both of them were Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain, they might have already been unable to hold back and fight for blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But judging from the current situation, the two of them didn’t seem to be able to suppress the killing intent in their hearts any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have always wanted to experience how formidable the Nine Nether Bird Clan is. I would love to give it a try today.” The Blood Hawk King darkly said as ferocity surged in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the scarlet-red light around him expanded into a violent tornado, covered with violent and vast Spiritual Energy fluctuations. It was like a series of blades as it wreaked havoc across the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then come and try.” Nine Nether replied with a cold smile. Purple flames abruptly surged around her and her hair fluttered in the purple flames as a terrifying temperature spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone saw the two of them, their faces couldn’t help slightly changing. If Nine Nether and the Blood Hawk King were to fight here, the effect definitely wouldn’t be something that a battle between the Domain Lords could be compared to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Commander position was still not the cornerstone of the Great Havenlaw Domain. Only those whose strength was similar to the Blood Hawk King and Nine Nether could be a central pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Enough!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when the two of them were facing off, a bark rang out as ripples similar to the gentle wind swept out. When it swept out, the violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations around Nine Nether and the Blood Hawk King were suppressed into their body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people directed their gazes over and saw Sky Vulture Emperor frowning his brows as he looked at the two people. He said in a solemn voice, “Have the both of you forgotten the rules of the Great Havenlaw Domain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Great Havenlaw Domain, the frictions between factions forbade the Kings from acting, only their subordinates were allowed to act. That way, they could continue the competitions while preserving the existence of Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Blood Hawk King saw that the Sky Vulture Emperor had taken action, he knew that he couldn’t do anything to Nine Nether today. He cast a glance at Cao Feng, who was practically crippled, and couldn’t swallow this anger down. His gaze was cold as he looked at Mu Chen. “Cao Feng was already defeated, but that Mu Chen was so ruthless. I feel that we should remove his qualifications.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen’s gaze turned cold as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dream on!” Nine Nether coldly laughed, “Blood Hawk King, are you perhaps a dotard? As long as no one admits defeat in this competition, the battle will still continue. Although Cao Feng was heavily injured, even if he was killed, he could only blame himself and not others!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then it’s impossible if you want my Blood Hawk Hall to swallow this!” Blood Hawk King opposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the dispute between those two, the Sky Vulture Emperor frowned his brows, while Spiritual Pupils Emperor faintly smiled next to him said, “I think that we should first remove Mu Chen to calm Blood Hawk King’s rage. In the future, we will find ways to compensate him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s face changed. His objective was the Greatlaw Goldpond, and now that he had finally reached here, how could he give it up? The so-called “compensation” was illusory, and he could not trust it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was a little furious in his heart, Mu Chen wasn’t reckless enough to express anything at this moment. Right now, his position in the Great Havenlaw Domain was still too low. There was no need to provoke trouble for Nine Nether just because he was angered for the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor frowned his brows. “If that’s the case, then who will participate in the Greatlaw Goldpond in the future?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, are lacking in those that want to enter the Greatlaw Goldpond?” The Spiritual Pupils Emperor smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the two dispute, Sleeping Emperor, who rarely spoke, faintly smiled. “Old rules, continue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor and the Spiritual Pupils Emperor were briefly stunned. For all these years, the Sleeping Emperor rarely joined in their disputes. It was rare for him to take the initiative to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, judging from the Sleeping Emperor’s words, he was evidently helping Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smear of darkness flashed in the depths of Spiritual Pupils Emperor’s eyes. Although he was also one of the three Emperors, he knew how unfathomable the Sleeping Emperor was. The crucial point was that the Sleeping Emperor was the most trusted aide of the Commander. Thus, it was best if he didn’t refute the words of the Sleeping Emperor, so he smiled on the spot. “Since Brother Meng has already said so, then we will continue as according to the rules.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Hawk King’s face grew pale and no longer dared to speak anymore. He gave Mu Chen an eerie snort as he waved his sleeve, turned around and descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether was also a little astonished as she cast a glance at the Sleeping Emperor. She gratefully nodded her head towards him, before shifting her gaze to Mu Chen. “Your performance is pretty good. But you will have to depend on yourself to see what opportunity awaits you in the Greatlaw Goldpond.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. Seeing his response, Nine Nether no longer spoke, turned around and descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Nine Nether’s leaving silhouette, Mu Chen turned his head over and respectfully cupped his fist towards the Sky Vulture Emperor and the Sleeping Emperor before descending towards the Greatlaw Goldstage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several gazes were firmly fixed on Mu Chen’s descending figure on the Greatlaw Goldstage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Qing and Zhou Yue’s gazes were filled with shock. The strength that Mu Chen had previously displayed must have made them feel somewhat fearful. Although they were stronger than Cao Feng, if they were to fight with the latter with their lives on the line, it could also cause quite a bit of trouble for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen could bear all of that. Just this point alone was sufficient to pull Mu Chen into the same rank as them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen landed on the Greatlaw Goldstage, there were still violent fluctuations of Spiritual Energy exploding from far away. After that, a miserable figure flew out, swiftly retreating while drawing a line on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen appeared behind that figure and placed his hand on the figure’s shoulder, helping him to dissolve the power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure turned his head over, it was Fang Lei. His face was pale and he bitterly smiled while looking at Mu Chen. Earlier, when Mu Chen fought with Cao Feng, he had also fought with Wu Tian. But evidently, he lost in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up ahead, light converged as Wu Tian appeared. His gaze was somewhat eerie as he looked at Mu Chen. But this time, there was a little fear in the depths of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, when he fought with Fang Lei, he had also paid attention to Cao Feng’s fight, and the extraordinary fighting strength that Mu Chen had displayed was sufficient to make him feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tian wasn’t an idiot. Otherwise, he wouldn’t become the highest regarded Commander by the Blood Hawk King. So, right now, he had redrawn all the contempt he had for Mu Chen and truly treated Mu Chen as an opponent of equal level to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have lost, Brother Mu Chen. I hope that you can reap some benefits from the Greatlaw Goldpond.” Fang Lei was also straightforward as he smiled towards Mu Chen and retreated from the Greatlaw Goldstage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was unhappy with Wu Tian, he knew that he had lost due to being incomparable to others. Thus, he did not recklessly seek help from Mu Chen.</span></p>

Although he also found Wu Tian unpleasing to the eyes, he knew that this wasn’t a good time to continue fighting. Previously, when he fought with Cao Feng, he had already exhausted a considerable amount of Spiritual Energy. Right now, he wasn’t in his best condition, so there wasn’t a need to risk it. After all, the four qualifications have already been determined right now.</span></p>

He originally wanted to take the chance to challenge Zhou Yue to move his ranking forward. But he never expected for Mu Chen to suddenly appear. Thus, he did not request a fight, in case it benefitted Mu Chen instead.</span></p>

They were a little stirred at this moment and knew that those four were the Four Great Domain Lords of the Great Havenlaw Domain. Aside from the new dark horse, Mu Chen, the remaining three were the old ones.</span></p>
