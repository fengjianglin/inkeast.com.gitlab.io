Those were the inheritance blood essences of Super Divine Beasts. If they could obtain any of those, they could evolve their bloodlines and smooth out their path in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so much so that they might even be able to step into the Earth Sovereign Realm.</span></p>

Facing those powerful competitors, even they could only watch as others harvested the fruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under those heated gazes, Mu Chen’s silhouette appeared at the end of the stone stairs. He landed before the stone statue. Looking over, the wings were unfolded, covering the skies, blazing with Undying Flames. So even if they had fallen after tens of thousands of years, there was still a faint vitality left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had a grave expression. Despite it being only a stone statue before him, he could still sense an indescribable pressure. The pressure had quickly descended onto his heart, causing him to feel like there was a boulder in his heart. If his mind wasn’t firm, he would be lying flat on the ground by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the might of a Super Divine Beast.</span></p>

He saw the faint flames on the Undying Bird’s statue suddenly blaze forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flames were extremely bizarre. They faintly looked like crystals. But as they burned, there was a boundless vitality spreading out that seemed undying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The highest grade of the Undying Flames!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, his Spiritual Energy also contained the power of the Undying Flames. Therefore, the familiarity came from that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Undying Flames before him were the highest grade of Undying Flames that were several times stronger than Nine Nether’s purple Undying Flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the crystalised flames appeared, Mu Chen suddenly felt that the statue had trembled. He was a little fearful to see that the eyes of the Undying Bird’s stone statue had suddenly opened at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its eyes were filled with primal chaos, without any pupils. But when it opened its eyes, the boundless Undying Flames swept out like a pillar of fire, enveloping Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arghhhh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment when the crystalised Undying Flames descended onto his body, Mu Chen’s face had instantly distorted and an indescribable burning pain was spreading throughout his body. The pain even nearly caused him to faint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But fortunately, thanks to his firm willpower, his mind wasn’t devoured by the pain. Thus, he immediately circulated the Dragon-Phoenix Physique. Instantly, the roar of a dragon and cry of a phoenix resounded from his body, trembling his blood and flesh and resisting the burning of the Undying Flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden lustre surged on the surface of his skin and the True Dragon and Phoenix Spirits started to move, constantly absorbing the Undying Flames, trying to help Mu Chen resist the damage from the burns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even despite their defences, the surface of Mu Chen’s skin was swiftly being burnt to the point that his flesh was starting to protrude, almost as if he was about to be incinerated by the domineering Undying Flames when looked from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden scene had caused the experts on the altar to change their expressions with shock in their eyes. Evidently, they could also sense how terrifying the Undying Flames were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this situation wasn’t only for Mu Chen. There were similar scenes that have appeared with the Myriad Spiritual Bird and the Desolate Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The statue of the Myriad Spiritual Bird was emitting a myriad-foot long lustre, along with a vague clear cry, which enveloped Zong Qingfeng, immediately pressuring him to the point that he had knelt down to the ground with crackling sounds being emitted from his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stone statue of the Desolate Beast was even more domineering. It had quickly stretched out its foot and stomped towards Lu Hou…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone saw this scene, they immediately understood that this was the final test left behind by the Three Beast Sovereigns. If they could pass the test, then they would be able to obtain the inheritance blood essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But out of the three tests, Zong Qingfeng and Lu Hou seemed to be having it easier than Mu Chen. After all, they were somewhat related to the Myriad Spiritual Bird and Desolate Beast, so the test for them wouldn’t be too difficult. But for Mu Chen, he was extremely unfortunate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crystalised flames were extremely domineering, ruthlessly burning Mu Chen to the point that his skin was torn apart. That scene didn’t seem like a test; on the contrary, it looked like it was burning someone that was from a different species.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, he’s courting death. A human actually dares to dip a finger in our Divine Beast Clan?” When Bai Bin saw this scene, he felt greatly relieved, ridicule flashing in his eyes. Previously, he was suppressed by Mu Chen to a pitiful state but right now, he could finally get his anger vented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nine Nether saw that Mu Chen was in extreme pain due to the Undying Flames, her face had changed, since she knew that the test actually wanted him to prove himself. The Primordial Undying Bird also didn’t want its inheritance blood essence to be obtained by someone that wasn’t related to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Nine Nether, what should we do?” Mo Ling asked urgently. The Undying Flames that enveloped Mu Chen were getting so strong that they seemed like they wanted to burn Mu Chen into ashes before it stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s face changed and, in the next moment, she gnashed her teeth, then cut her wrist open with her fingers. Instantly, fresh blood gushed out like a pillar of blood from the wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a crook of her finger, the fresh blood flew out and descended from above, onto Mu Chen’s burning body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her bloodline came from the Undying Bird, so her blood should be able to help Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as she had expected, when her blood descended, although Mu Chen was drenched in blood, the crystalised flames on his body started to weaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the intense burning pain had also gradually faded and Mu Chen’s distorted face slowly recovered. His eyes flashed when he saw the weakened Undying Flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those Undying Flames were of the highest grade, both domineering and pure with boundless vitality. If he could refine and absorb them, then integrate it into his own Spiritual Energy, it could allow his own Spiritual Energy to grow and multiply without end. Even the quality would be raised to a new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since it had caused such great pain for him, it must naturally give him something in return. If he let it dissipate like this, then it would be too wasteful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As thoughts circulated, Mu Chen no longer hesitated and a suction force burst out from his body, forcefully absorbing strands of the crystalised flames into his body and integrated it into his Sovereign Sea.</span></p>

With a will of his thoughts, he had circulated his Spiritual Energy to form a current that swept the crystallised flames into his Sovereign Sea, gradually refining them through the burn.</span></p>

As the flames disappeared, the surface of Mu Chen’s body glowed with a golden light and his burnt skin and flesh were swiftly healing under the Dragon-Phoenix Physique. Furthermore, the lustre was even greater and an explosive power was contained beneath his skin.</span></p>

If the latter had not used her blood to help him, he would probably be hovering between life and death from the burns by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That bitch!”</span></p>

He was in expectation to see Mu Chen burn to death. At that time, he would be able to make a move and seize the inheritance blood essence of the Undying Bird. He never expected Nine Nether to suddenly make a move and help Mu Chen resist the burning of the Undying Flames, shattering his thoughts completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But since things had already happened, there was nothing he could do, so he could only swallow the rage. It was so much so that he didn’t even dare to viciously look at Mu Chen, fearing that the latter might sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the last strand of Undying Flames faded from the surface of Mu Chen’s body, light blossomed from the stone statue of the Undying Bird once again. Mu Chen, who had suffered a great deal before, did not dare to slowly react. He quickly took a step back and faced it with a stern expression, fearing that he would be tortured by that damnable stone statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But fortunately, nothing happened at this moment. There was an additional splendour in the eyes of the Undying Bird’s stone statue. It was no longer hollow like before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It lowered its eyes and looked at Mu Chen, before opening its sharp peak and a boundless lustre gushed out. The lustre was extremely scarlet, which had condensed into a palm-sized crimson gem and there seemed to be a soaring Undying Bird within the gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw that crimson gem, his emotions rolled even with his composure, since he knew that this must’ve been the inheritance blood essence of the Undying Bird.</span></p>

He had finally obtained the inheritance blood essence!</span></p>
