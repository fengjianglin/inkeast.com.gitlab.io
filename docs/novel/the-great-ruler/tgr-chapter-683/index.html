 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the elated fighting intent in this region was dense to the limit, a bell had finally rung within this region and resonated for a long time without dissipating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light gathered up in the sky as space distorted with three light figures slowly revealing themselves. Judging from the looks of it, they were the three that had the highest position in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sky Vulture Emperor, Spiritual Pupils Emperor, as well as the deep and unfathomable Sleeping Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those three showed themselves, the innumerable figures below bowed as they saluted with respect. Even the Nine Kings had their heads slightly lowered. In this region, only those three Emperors stood with indifference, displaying their position that was beyond anyone’s reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sky Vulture Emperor waved his hand. Everyone felt a wave of gentle energy surging over that made everyone straighten their bodies once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I believe everyone is aware of the Greatlaw Goldpond’s rules, so I will not speak any further. No matter what means you guys resort to ascend the peak, no one would care. Here, only the results matters and not the methods.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There will only be four final ones that can enter the Greatlaw Goldpond, it will depend on your own capability on how you seize it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with Sky Vulture Emperor’s aging voice slowly ringing out, the atmosphere in this region suddenly felt chilling, the eyes of many experts gradually turned sharp. Those that participated in the competition for the Greatlaw Goldpond were outstanding geniuses amongst their forces. No matter what opponents they faced, they would definitely not feel fear so easily. Thus, the battle for the four quotas would definitely be a cruel competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time is almost up.” Spiritual Pupils Emperor had spiritual light flickering in his eyes as he spoke with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor exchanged a glance as they shifted their gazes towards the sleepy man next to them with a smile. “Brother Meng, let’s open the Goldpond Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were the three Emperors, the two of them had always been polite with the Sleeping Emperor that had not been interfering with the matters of the Great Havenlaw Domain. They knew that amongst the three of them, the latter was the one that was most trusted by the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Sleeping Emperor yawned without any concern for his image as he slowly nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzzz.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three streaks of light shot from the hands of the three Emperors directly into the Goldpond Peak. After that, everyone witnessed the space outside the Goldpond Peak gradually distorting as it gradually cleared up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Goldpond Peak cleared up, a shapeless and boundless Spiritual Energy instantly swept out, causing the entire heavens and earth to be mixed with the colour of gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A current of gold flowed down from the majestic mountain, making the Goldpond Peak seem like it was forged with gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is the Goldpond current, it is a might that is similar to an impact of a myriad of waves. Only those that are in the Sovereign Realm can barely withstand it. All those that ascend the mountain will have to suffer the impacts of the Goldpond current before they can claim the peak.” Qiu Shan explained to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head as his expression became a little grave. Clearly, he had felt how powerful the Goldpond current was. This Greatlaw Goldpond was indeed weird…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Goldpond Peak became radiant to the limits, the three Emperors up on the horizon waved their hands together. Space fluctuated as a clear and melodious bell rang out as it resonated across the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s eyes turned heated at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The competition of the Greatlaw Goldpond will begin… now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Sky Vulture Emperor’s indifferent voice rang throughout the horizon, streaks of powerful Spiritual Energy pillars soared into the sky. Many rays of light swiftly shot towards the Goldpond Peak at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the eight stone stages, the various Domain Lords under the eight Kings had all moved out as well. In an instant, screechings of wind rang throughout the heavens and earth, causing even the Spiritual Energy in this region to show signs of boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Mu, we will depend on you!” Qiu Zhan, Bei Mo and Lan Hai, the three strongest among the Nine Nether Palace, had cupped their fists at Mu Chen. For all of these years, their Nine Nether Palace was nearly forgotten by everyone. This time, they would have to depend on Mu Chen’s performance in the competition of the Goldpond to see if there was a good opening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head with a light smile and spoke no further. The tip of his foot tapped as he turned into a ray of light and streaked across the horizon. In the end, entering the majestic Goldpond Peak under the countless gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seated on the throne of the stone stage, Nine Nether had her gaze focused on Mu Chen’s silhouette as her hand gently tightened her grip on the armrest. She could only depend on Mu Chen’s performance next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Nine Nether, will Mu Chen be able to obtain the quota for the Goldpond?” Tang Rou had nervousness written on her face. They all knew that the competition of the Goldpond this time was extremely important for the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, he will not disappoint us.” There was a smear of a smile appearing on Nine Nether’s beautiful oval face, she naturally had a considerable amount of confidence for Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If he fails, you’ll see how I’ll deal with him.” Tang Bing stared at that figure with a little hatred in her tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Nine Nether couldn’t help laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, the three Emperors waved their hands. Space fluctuated as Spiritual Energies converged, forming numerous massive screens made of Spiritual Energy. Everyone that had entered the Goldpond peak was reflected on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seated on the nine stone stages, the various Kings had raised their heads, staring at the screen of spiritual energy with different expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen’s figure had entered the Goldpond Peak, there was a golden current flowing over him as he stood on the ground. Even mountains could be crushed to dust, judging from the surging speed, the momentum of it was very shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under that impact, anyone beneath the cultivation of Sovereign Realm would be crushed to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden current was reflected in Mu Chen’s pupils, but his expression was somewhat calm. He flicked his fingers and a Spiritual Energy that was burning with purple flames swept out. It was like a waterfall that tore apart the golden current.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant when the golden current was torn apart, Mu Chen’s silhouette had mysteriously charged in along the crack as he swiftly made his way to the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, there were continuously powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations exploding on this majestic mountain. Everyone that was on the mountain was exploding their strength as they tore apart the golden current and worked their way to the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that no matter how fast they were in ascending the peak, there was only four people that could obtain a quota in the end. Thus, everyone was basically each other’s opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they wanted to obtain the quota, they would have to decrease the numbers of competitors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely so that the beginning of the ascension of the peak was cruel. When some people were trying their best to tear apart the golden current and make their way towards the summit, there were sharp and vicious attacks coming from the dark that quietly swept over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent Spiritual Energies wreaked havoc on the majestic mountain as light figures flickered, and killing noises resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s foot heavily stepped on a rock, instantly reducing it to dust with his figure flying out like a light ray. However, just when he had flown out, there were sharp screeches of wind that rang out from his rear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attack that suddenly arrived did not make Mu Chen panic, he slapped out with the back of his hand as majestic Spiritual Energy turned into a huge palm that clashed against the attack coming from the rear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The violent Spiritual Energies wreaked havoc as a deep groaning voice came from his rear, and a figure was sent flying away and was swept into the golden current. That figure looked extremely battered as he swiftly retreated and no longer dared to provoke Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was not aggressive as he casually cast a glance over and swiftly charged out once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In barely ten minutes, he had already suffered nearly ten assaults. However, those assaults weren’t specially targeted at him, it was just coincidence. After all, there weren’t any allies amongst those that came here. If they could find a chance to decrease the number of competitors, who knows, their chance might increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head as he blinked his eyes, staring at the golden current. Vaguely, he could see ten figures up ahead that were like swimming dragons. Those could be considered the first group that ascended the Goldpond Peak. Those figures weren’t easy to deal with, since they possessed utmost strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not directly force his way into the first group, since he knew that being too eye-catching right now wasn’t a good thing. Furthermore, due to Tang Bing’s warning, he knew that the Blood Hawk King had arranged for people to deal with him. If he wasn’t careful, he might suffer a defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as thoughts flowed into Mu Chen’s mind, two figures abruptly crisscrossed. One of the people slapped a palm out, the palm had directly tore apart the golden current as it swiftly landed on the other party’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one that was hit spewed a mouthful of blood as his figure flew back. His opponent did not chase after him, he only cast his gaze and saw Mu Chen, who wasn’t far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two exchanged looks as their bodies slightly tensed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s expression was calm, the person before him had a rather ordinary appearance. His figure was rather tall and sturdy, as if it was an iron tower. However, although he had a robust figure, his eyes revealed his cautiousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of this person wasn’t ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slight astonishment flashed across Mu Chen’s heart as he had sensed a somewhat decent Spiritual Energy fluctuation coming from the person before him. Also, what made him even more astonished was that this person wasn’t amongst the subordinates of the Nine Kings, so he must be from a subsidiary force of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That robust man cast a glance at Mu Chen. Although the latter was slightly young, in regards to age, he felt dense danger coming from him. The youth before him might seem calm and gentle, but deep down in his bones, he was a concealing ferocious tiger that posed a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the robust man had only nodded his head at Mu Chen in a slightly friendly way as his figure flew towards another direction. The meaning behind his actions was clear, everyone minds their own business.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen watched as the robust man left and slightly stopped his steps. A chill gathered in his black pupils as he sensed four chilling fluctuations that were swiftly approaching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who were sent by the Blood Hawk King to deal with him had finally started to act.</span></p>
