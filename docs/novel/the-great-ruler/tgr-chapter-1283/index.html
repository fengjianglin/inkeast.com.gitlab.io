 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1283 - The Eight-Divisional Pagoda</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You two saw the sinful child?” Hearing the azure-clothed man’s words, Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha’s bodies trembled as they promptly nodded their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why was I not informed beforehand?” The azure-clothed man gently asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But facing his gentle tone, Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha’s faces were pale before they bitterly replied, “The two of us initially thought that we could capture him first before handing him over to the Young Master. It was our mistake in our lack of consideration, so please forgive us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The azure-robed man gently knocked his finger on his knee as he faintly swept his gaze at the two of them. When the two of them had their backs drenched in sweat, only then did he slowly say, “Although the two of you have taken actions without approval, I’ll let this matter go for the sake that the two of you have followed me for a long time. As for the Grand Elder, I will personally explain to him so that the two of you can be exempted from punishment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We express our gratefulness, Young Master!” Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha rejoiced upon hearing those words and swiftly expressed their thanks with gratefulness in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that the sinful child has also cultivated the Divine Pagoda?” The azure-clothed man slightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shihuang nodded his head. “Young Master, the sinful child is blessed with great talent. Despite being only a Greater Earth Sovereign, he managed to force me to a pathetic state. According to my probings, he must have formed the Divine Pagoda as well. Otherwise, how can he possess such powerful Spiritual Energy as a Greater Earth Sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The azure-clothed man smiled with his eyes narrowed. “Truly the son of Qing Yanjing. I never thought that even without the resources of the Ancient Buddha Clan, he could also come this far.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Xiesha replied with hatred, “Although that sinful child is somewhat capable, he’s akin to a firefly, when compared to the brilliant moon, Young Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is for sure. Young Master is a rare genius in my Ancient Buddha Clan. In the future, when you command the Ancient Buddha Clan, Mu Chen will be dim in comparison to the Young Master.” Gu Shihuang nodded his head hurriedly as he expressed his acknowledgment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Gu Shihuang briefly paused and hesitated. “But when we fought with the sinful child, I realised that he has two other clones with the same cultivation as his main body. They’re extremely tough to deal with, and I even nearly died in his hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two clones as powerful as his main body?” The azure-clothed man’s gaze flickered as he fell into pondering for a long time before his expression turned into astonishment. “Could it be… one of the 36 Peerless Divine Abilities, the Three Pures?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-robed Heavenly Sovereign’s face also briefly changed as he nodded by the side. “Ordinary clones made of Spiritual Energy can only possess 1/10 of the main body’s power. To completely possess it, it has to be the legendary Three Pures.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But the Three Pures has been missing for so many years. I never expected that the sinful child would have such a shocking fortune.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke, the eyes of the black-robed Heavenly Sovereign revealed greed. After all, such a Peerless Divine Ability was attractive to even a Heavenly Sovereign like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only Young Master is worthy of such a powerful Peerless Divine Ability, how can that sinful child possess it?!” Gu Shihuang harshly spoke, trying to provoke the azure-robed man into taking revenge for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the azure-robed man maintained a calm expression, since he wasn’t shaken. “The Three Pures are truly tempting, but I don't have the time to look for him right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-robed Heavenly Sovereign nodded his head as well. “The Young Master is right, and the Primordial Sacred Abyss is approaching, so the Young Master needs to perform beautifully in the Sacred Abyss. If Young Master can obtain the long lost Peerless Divine Ability of our clan, the Eight-Divisional Pagoda, you will surely be able to surpass the other competitors and become the next Patriarch of our clan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Eight-Divisional Pagoda?!” Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha’s hearts trembled as they exclaimed, “Could it be that legendary Eight-Divisional Pagoda that is also one of the 36 Peerless Divine Abilities?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, the azure-clothed man said, “What is there to be shocked about? The Eight-Divisional Pagoda is something that belongs to our clan, since an ancestor created it. It’s just that the ancestor had unfortunately died in the battle with the Sky Monarchs of the Fiend Clans and fell. Thus, the Eight-Divisional Pagoda is also lost. All this time, the clan has been trying to search for it, but they hadn’t been successful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ancient Sacred Abyss is an ancient battlefield between the Great Thousand World and the Fiend Clans. The environment is so harsh that even a Perfected Earth Sovereign might die without a trace in there if they were careless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-robed Heavenly Sovereign sighed, “It’s a pity that the rejection force from that region is too strong. It’s an intersection between the Great Thousand World and the Fiend Clans, so if a Heavenly Sovereign approaches, it will cause chaos. If they’re careless, they might even be sent into the territories of the Fiend Clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha heard those words, their bodies trembled. Even a Heavenly Sovereign would slowly die of exhaustion if they were thrown into the territories of the Fiend Clans, and if they attracted the attention of the other party’s monarchs, then they would surely be doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the clan, the other Young Masters are preparing to enter the Ancient Sacred Abyss. Naturally, their motive is also the Eight-Divisional Pagoda. If they obtain it, then even Young Master would instantly fall into the lower hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, the black-robed Heavenly Sovereign’s face turned solemn, since he knew that the consequences would be grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha had also nodded their heads. Compared to their Young Master, dealing with the sinful child could be temporarily placed aside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But since we’re placing our attention on the Ancient Sacred Abyss, we still must pay attention to the sinful child’s movements. I’m extremely interested in the legendary Three Pures.” The azure-clothed man lightly smiled as he continued, “If I can obtain the Eight-Divisional Pagoda and the Three Pures, even as a Perfected Earth Sovereign, I will have no fear, even when facing a genuine Heavenly Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two legendary Peerless Divine Abilities must undoubtedly be something that exceeded imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master is wise, and only Young Master is worthy of such treasures. As for that sinful child, it’s his fortune that Young Master could use him.” Gu Shihuang immediately said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The azure-clothed man smiled and said in a gentle tone, “Send some people to track that sinful child’s location. After this trip to the Ancient Sacred Abyss, I will personally make a trip to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If he is willing to hand over the Three Pures to me, I don’t mind helping him speak up in front of the Grand Elder…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But naturally… I must be able to grasp him in my hand. Who knows, he might even be a chip for dealing with Qing Yanjing. If I can pull her over to my camp, our strength should be sufficient.” The black-robed Heavenly Sovereign nodded his head as he continued, “Although Qing Yanjing has been imprisoned for years, there are still some supporters in the clan behind her, so her power cannot be underestimated. If we can cause them to lean towards us, it will be greatly beneficial for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The azure-robed man nodded his head, then looked into the depths of the clouds with a gentle smile. “It looks like that sinful child can be considered my star of fortune…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen looked at the cool lady in the dark prison and felt heavily relieved. From the looks of it, Ling Xi seemed pretty well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Xi had also raised her head and looked at the young man. After a brief moment, a dense and gratified smile rose on her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to back then, Mu Chen had completely grown up. His tenderness had disappeared, replaced with a firm heart that cannot be shaken. He still looked handsome, but had a slightly more mature charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Mu Chen, Ling Xi’s smile turned even gentler. The teen from back then… had turned into someone that could face the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He no longer needed her protection, nor needed her to be always worried about him. She figured it out when she saw how he fearlessly stomped into the Spiritual Jade Island. That young man had grown to the point that he would no longer be afraid of any storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aunt Jing… Mu Chen, he has finally grown up. You can be relieved now, and I believe that not long from now, no one in the Ancient Buddha Clan will use him to threaten you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Ling Xi.” Mu Chen looked at Ling Xi with a brilliant smile on his face before he waved his sleeve and slammed his palm against the prison, trying to break it apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the prison still sturdily stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Erm…” Mu Chen was stunned before he looked at the prison in shock. At that moment, only then did he realise that the prison was actually formed of a Spiritual Array, and judging from the level of it, it might be even more powerful than the one protecting the island. Mu Chen awkwardly scratched his head, since it seemed that his attempt in trying to act cool had failed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li couldn’t hold back her laughter while standing behind him, and even Ling Xi had pursed her lips together and smiled. After that, she formed seals with a single hand and a Spiritual Energy fluctuation emanated from underground before the prison started to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ling Xi, so you have gained control of this array!” Long Xiang couldn’t help being stunned when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Spiritual Array was something that Aunt Jing had set up herself, so I have naturally gained control of it after staying here for three years. So even if you guys didn’t come, Gu Shihuang couldn’t do a thing to me.” Ling xi gently smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard her words, Mu Chen’s group of three exchanged a glance and bitterly smiled, since they had done something meaningless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing their speechless expressions, Ling Xi smiled. “Naturally, Big Sister is still happy that Mu Chen has come and save me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her smile was so incredibly charming that it came from the depths of her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But… it looks like you are pretty lucky that you can make it here.” Ling Xi looked at Mu Chen’s puzzled gaze before her hand gently tapped on the smooth mirror-like black stone that shone like a star, and her next sentence caused Mu Chen’s eyes to widen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because… there’s a gift from Aunt Jing that was left for you here.”</span></p>
