The ear-piercing sound wave swept out like waves. Numerous deep cracks appeared on the floor with a dreadful pressure spreading out. Under that pressure, not to mention ordinary students, even several Deans had a drastic change in their expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the real body of the Primordial Skydragon Hawk?” Several Deans had a heavy expression as the exclaimed in astonishment, looking at the colossal being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is indeed the real body of it, not the so-called Soul Essence… but why was a Primordial Skydragon Hawk hidden in Ji Xuan’s body? With his strength, how could he do it?” A Dean spoke out in a doubtful tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Primordial Skydragon Hawk was ranked 8 on the Spiritual Beast Records. When such powerful Spiritual Beast entered its maturity state, it possessed strength that could even rival Sovereigns. But with Ji Xuan’s cultivation, he had just established his own Sovereign Sea so, strictly speaking, he had not ascended to the Sovereign Realm yet. Thus, it was impossible for him to suppress a Primordial Skydragon Hawk and use its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several Deans exchanged looks as their expressions turned a little doubtful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The strength of that Primordial Skydragon Hawk probably reached the level of Fourth Grade Sovereign… I’m afraid that there’s no longer any point to continue the battle.” A Dean spoke helplessly as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fourth Grade Sovereign, that sort of cultivation could become a Dean of an ordinary Spiritual Academy, even in the Five Great Sovereigns, they were all influential Elders. The strength far surpassed the imagination of other students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, Dean Tiansheng, isn’t it cheating for your academy to do this? The Primordial Skydragon Hawk isn’t something that belonged to Ji Xuan but was an external strength which isn’t in the rules of the tournament!” Up in midair, Dean Tai Cang’s face was a little dark as he witnessed the scene and spoke upon taking a cold glance at the Primordial Skydragon Hawk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Tiansheng smiled faintly, “Dean Taicang, this sentence of yours is wrong. The Primordial Skydragon Hawk isn’t related to our Saint Spiritual Academy, it was by Ji Xuan himself. Furthermore, he had a lodging relationship with this Primordial Skydragon Hawk, he had paid a huge price to accomplish this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lodging?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three other Deans were slightly startled, the so-called ‘lodging’ was a hazardous method as the Primordial Skydragon Hawk stays in a human body; however, it would continuously attempt to seize the consciousness of the host to replace it. Likewise, the host was also trying to refine it and make the strength of the beast his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was simply a gamble of life, the moment one side loses, they would have to pay an irreversible price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, generally speaking, not many people and mighty Spiritual Beasts would choose this method, and to the humans, who would want a time bomb in their body. As for the Spiritual Beasts, who would want to be in such a dangerous scenario?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, this relationship of lodging was sporadic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Primordial Skydragon Hawk had its eyes on Ji Xuan’s body; &nbsp;thus, it desires to seize it, and likewise, Ji Xuan also had his eyes on the power of the Primordial Skydragon Hawk. Thus, they formed a lodging relationship, so this strength wasn’t external for Ji Xuan, which isn’t against the rules.” Dean Tiansheng spoke with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Deans fell into silence. It was fine for the Primordial Skydragon Hawk, since Ji Xuan’s strength was weak. Thus, it had a certain chance of success to defeat Ji Xuan. However, Ji Xuan was a little decisive and ruthless, his schemes ran deep in his heart, so he must have little preparation. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t go for such a dangerous move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Tai Cang’s face was solemn and did not speak further. Although this strength that Ji Xuan had was a shortcut, it was something that he had obtained in exchange for his own life. He slightly raised his head and looked at the youth’s silhouette that was in midair and sighed in his heart. Mu Chen’s performance was already perfect, but who could have expected Ji Xuan to have such a trump card concealed up his sleeves?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow… so he had a real body of the Primordial Skydragon Hawk within him!” Wen Qingxuan clenched her teeth as she looked at the Primordial Skydragon Hawk and bitterly smiled, “Looks like we’ve belittled Ji Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li couldn’t help having her hands slightly clenched as she looked at Mu Chen’s silhouette. The youth’s face was calm as water, there wasn’t any joy or anger written on his face, but she knew that the latter had suffered a considerable amount of shock in his heart as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should leave first.” Luo Li spoke in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about you?” Wen Qingxuan replied, startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen will not give up, so I will accompany him till the end.” Luo Li showed a faint smile, her smile had unwavering firmness in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That Primordial Skydragon Hawk’s strength is comparable to Fourth Grade Sovereign, even if you join hands with Mu Chen, it is impossible to win.” Wen Qingxuan spoke anxiously, “Just give up, it’s only a competition. Furthermore, anyone could tell that Ji Xuan has cheated, that strength definitely isn’t something that he cultivated himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Regarding real strength, he has already lost to Mu Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li softly shook her head with a smile, “Do you feel that Mu Chen will back off?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan was speechless as she knew the grudges between those two. Although that fellow was gentle most of the time, there was an unusual stubbornness in his bones. So even when he knew that he could not defeat Ji Xuan right now, he would probably not admit defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a fool.” Wen Qingxuan sighed, but she had to admit that the fellow was pretty good when he was stubborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, let us go together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan gritted her teeth in the end and with the time she had earlier, she had recovered quite a bit of fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li was astonished as she looked at Wen Qingxuan, as there wasn’t a reason for the latter to fight this match with them that didn’t have any odds of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan’s face flushed red from Luo Li’s gaze as she hastily said, “That fellow helped me before, and I am not an ungrateful person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li smiled with another meaning behind her gaze. However, she did not speak and only lightly nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any noise in this region as numerous students had their mouths widened. Evidently, they were overwhelmed with shock by the Primordial Skydragon Hawk. Furthermore, that level of pressure had already surpassed their limits, aware that it wasn’t a standard that they could come in contact with, at least not now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy region was also quiet, and innumerable people had a paled expression, the joy they had on their faces vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the gazes of everyone, Ji Xuan casually cracked his neck in midair with brittle bone-breaking noise resounding. He raised his head with a cold expression and looked at Mu Chen with a smile, “Are you feeling despair?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any expression on Mu Chen’s face as he slowly clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Primordial Skydragon Hawk raised its wild eyes and started at Mu Chen with indifference. The strength of the latter wasn’t even placed in its heart and shifted its gaze onto Ji Xuan and spoke with a sound that only the latter could hear, “This is the fellow that forced you to summon me? Ji Xuan, do you know that the more of my strength you use, I’ll be able to erode your conscious further.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Xuan faintly smiled as he responded, “Then hope that before I surpass you, you will be able to seize my body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, before that, the both of us share our lives, if one of us die, so will the other. Thus, behave well and help me get rid of that fellow.”</span></p>

Furthermore, both of his hands turned sharp with dark purple nails that looked like daggers. Along with that, a dreadful gale of Spiritual Energy whistled around him that tore through the heavens and earth. Judging from the fluctuations of Spiritual Energy, it had already reached the actual Sovereign Realm level.</span></p>

Both of his eyes had shaped sharply like a hawk as he raised his head and smiled at Mu Chen. He flapped his wings, sweeping out with dark purple Spiritual Energy gales as they charged towards Mu Chen with unparalleled might.</span></p>

The Great Meru Demonic Pillar soared into the sky and furiously dived down.</span></p>

Mu Chen slammed his palm onto it, but the impact behind the force caused intense pain on both of his arms, the web on his palm tore apart with fresh blood flowing from it. If it wasn’t for the strength of his physical body, just this alone might kill him.</span></p>

As he finished speaking, a sharp whistling of wind suddenly rang out from his rear. However, he slapped it with the back of his hand without giving it a look. The space distorted along with purple Spiritual Energy sweeping out. It was like a vast purple serpent that swept over.</span></p>

But judging from the situation, they weren’t Ji Xuan’s opponents at this moment.</span></p>

He looked to be in a rather miserable state, but even when he was at the passive, he still had cold killing intent in his eyes without any trace of fear or retreat.</span></p>
