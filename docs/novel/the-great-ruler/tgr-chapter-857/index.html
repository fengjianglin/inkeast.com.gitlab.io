Due to the sky being covered by violent Spiritual Energy throughout the years, daytime and nighttime were hard to tell in the battlefield. But, regardless of the environment, the brutal Hunting War slowly exploded as time passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a few days’ time, more forces had entered this ancient battlefield, searching around for ruins like rats. The discovery of every ruin would be accompanied by other forces that were like sharks that had detected the stench of blood. Thus, the ruins had become a bloody meat grinding machine…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battles were unavoidable for the ownership of those ruins and in those bloody and brutal battles, many experts have fallen, with the entire region shrouded in cruel slaughters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But since the chessboard had already been opened, those who entered were chess pieces. And those that could come out of it alive had naturally experienced a true deathmatch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle between the Great Havenlaw Domain and Divine Pavilion had also swiftly spread out in the past few days. After all, Mu Chen had directly pursued the Skycroc Troop for a thousand miles and the commotion caused by it couldn’t be covered up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Havenlaw Doman and Divine Pavilion were peak forces in the Northern Region, thus their actions would greatly attract the attention of others. So, when this news had spread out, it had caused quite a bit of commotion. Especially when Mu Chen relied on his own power to fight Fang Yi on the same level and have it end with the both of them gravely injured, then commanding the Nine Nether Troop to suppress Fang Yi with the help of Battle Will. Furthermore, when the news of him obstructing the Skycroc Lord, Xu Ba, spread out, the commotion had turned into shock and disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, Mu Chen’s name had already made rounds in the Northern Region. But many people still had doubts about his ranking as the third on the Dragon-Phoenix Record. That’s because, in their views, the reason why Mu Chen became the greatest benefactor of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was greatly related to the help of the daughter of the Flame Emperor. So his achievements have caused many doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But all those doubts had been shattered at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few months ago, Mu Chen had only barely managed to stall the Netherworld Prince in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven with all his strength and was still in a disadvantageous position. It had only been a short three to four months and he could rely on his own power to fight with the Overlord of the Dragon-Phoenix Record, Fang Yi, to an outcome of both being heavily injured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The growth of his strength was something that left others dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, amongst the news that left innumerable experts astonished had included the fact that Mu Chen could actually command Battle Will. Furthermore, he had also managed to refine the Spirit of Battle Will. If he had those powers gathered before him, he could even suppress Fang Yi… and confront the Skycroc Lord Xu Ba, a veteran expert!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such strength was enough to make other forces view him with caution and no longer treated Mu Chen as a greenhorn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As cruel battles gradually unfolded in the Hunting War, Mu Chen’s name had also gradually spread out…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Except this time, no one was doubting him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince retracted his fist without any emotions, before descending from the sky. There was a figure that flashed beside him. He lowered his head and did not speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen…” The Netherworld Prince narrowed his eyes with a flash of astonishment. He never thought that the fellow that was forced into a pathetic state by him would have such improvements in just a few months’ time. He was able to fight with Fang Yi and have a conclusion where the both of them were heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince slowly retracted his hand, then turned around with his cold voice lightly spreading out in the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I originally wanted to defeat Fang Yi myself. But since you can fight with him to this level, then I’ll deal with you first, if we encounter one another… But this time, there’s no one to save you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

Standing above that troop was a figure that placed his hands behind his back with an ocean of Battle Will beneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was grinning as he looked forward. There was also a troop before him, but the Battle Will of that troop had practically been suppressed by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you, die.”</span></p>

He balled his fist and the ocean of Battle Will whistled, forming into a huge blood-red python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was actually a Spirit of Battle Will as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

It was like a huge axe that sliced through the troop before him. Instantly, there were endless shrieks that resounded with silhouettes falling from the sky with blood on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure smiled, before turning his head and looked at another silhouette with a smile. “Young Palace Master. The person you’re talking about is called Mu Chen, right? His name has been spreading like wildfire, right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind that silhouette, was a dark face. It was Liu Yan of the Sky Profound Palace. His face was filled with deep hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After having his body destroyed in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, his father had spent a huge amount of effort to reconstruct his physical body. Otherwise, he would have been completely crippled by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never expected that brat to be able to command Battle Will and even refine the Spirit of Battle Will.” Liu Yan eerily said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure smiled as he licked his scarlet lips and the blood veins on his eyes became even more visible. He lightly said, “Young Palace Master, why don’t we make a trade? I will let Mu Chen kneel before you like a dog as long as you can help me become the Grand Commander of the Sky Profound Palace…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan narrowed his eyes with a sinister light gushing from his eyes. He had only pondered for a brief moment, before he heavily nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay!”</span></p>

Her eyes were quietly looking at this mess with a multitude of black troops spreading out behind her. Even their breathing was synchronised, with their boundless Battle Will spreading out in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every gaze held revere as they looked at the young lady’s frail silhouette.</span></p>

It’s said that Mu Chen has also refined the Spirit of Battle Will, and Lord Fang said that if you are willing to deal with Mu Chen, he’s willing to obtain the Nine Heavens Soul Replenishing Herb for your sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the words ‘Nine Heavens Soul Replenishing Herb’, the eyes of the young lady that seemed like an abyss finally rippled.

The weak falling prey to the strong took place here without restraints.</span></p>

He had started to put the Spiritual Compass to full use after the effort he had spent to recruit the four Kings and the four powerful troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been striving to obtain the Fallen Origin Pellets at every single moment. This way, who knows, he might have enough to allow the Ruler of his forces to obtain the initiative to enter the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury. Therefore, Mu Chen definitely couldn’t let such a Divine Artifact, the Spiritual Compass be wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the full-force search of their huge force, and with the help of the Spiritual Compass, they had obtained an extremely shocking harvest in just four days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just four days, they had found over thirty ruins. Amongst them, there were about a dozen of those that weren’t at the Grade-3 Ruin level and ten at the Grade-3 Ruin level. They even managed to find a Grade-2 Ruin…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst those thirty-plus ruins, they had obtained nearly ten thousand Fallen Origin Pellets. Splitting up their harvest, each force had obtained at least 2000 Fallen Origin Pellets. Such a harvest even made someone of the Mountain Splitting King’s bearing to show ecstasy on his face. If they had gone around blindly searching, getting over 2000 Fallen Origin Pellets in four days was basically a dream.</span></p>

That’s because, when they found some ruins, it had also attracted the attention of other forces. But when those forces saw their horrifying formation, they all chose to give up. What a joke, a total of five Sixth Grade Sovereigns present here with five elite troops. Even a Seventh Grade Sovereign could only make a detour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, some ruins were filled with danger. Take the only Grade-2 Ruin that they had found, for example. There were actually ten fallen experts with bodies that had not completely rotted due to special reasons. And amongst them, there were four that were comparable to Sixth Grade Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Grade-2 Ruin had caused quite a bit of trouble for them. It was so much so that there were even casualties, and that was adding on the fact that Mu Chen had brought along Four Kings with him. If their Nine Nether Palace dared to enter that place alone, their casualties would probably have been even worse.</span></p>

It was a black multitude of people. It was Mu Chen and this group that had finished an exploration. They were resting here.</span></p>

Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked down. With the Nine Nether Troop included, five troops quietly sat with boundless Battle Will surging above them.</span></p>
