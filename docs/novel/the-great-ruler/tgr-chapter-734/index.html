Deep in his gaze, there was a joy that could not be concealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had really managed to fuse with the Nether Demon Heart Lightning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether also exclaimed in admiration at this scene as she gave Mu Chen a smile, “Congratulations, I never thought that you would really succeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the beginning, she only held the intention for him to give it a try. After all, she was clear that it would be a very difficult task for two different Spiritual Energies to coexist in the Sovereign Sea. But the results were clearly an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. Since knowing him, this youth before him seemed to have constantly achieved feats that would blow others away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was just luck.” Mu Chen smiled. His words weren’t fake. If it wasn’t for the Nine-layered Pagoda, he didn’t know how long it would take for him to successfully suppress the two violent Spiritual Energies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But right now, you have yet to truly fuse the two powers together.” Nine Nether’s eyes were clearly more keen than Mu Chen’s. With a single glance, she had already discovered that the two Spiritual Energies didn’t seem to be harmonious, since they had not reached the degree of perfect fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly shook his head. He naturally knew that if the two Spiritual Energies could perfectly fuse together, the power would surely reach a whole new level. But it was too difficult for his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No worries, it’s more than enough for you, right now.” Nine Nether smiled lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why Mu Chen wanted to fuse with the Nether Demon Heart Lightning was to execute the perfect Nine Dragons and Elephants Art. Now that he possessed two powers of two different attributes, he could bring out the lustre of this Quasi-Perfect Divine Art in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head upon hearing her words. What Nine Nether said wasn’t wrong. It was a great fortune for him to fuse with the Nether Demon Heart Lightning, there wasn’t a need for him to be too greedy. He believed that as his strength grew, there would be a day when he could easily fuse the two Spiritual Energies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But, right now, you do have the qualifications to cultivate it.” Nine Nether pointed her slender finger towards the broken stone tablet that was floating, envy shining in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had long heard of the great name of the Supreme Demon Heart Scripture. Now that she saw it, it was hard for her not to be tempted by it. But temptation was still temptation, in the end. She understood that she wasn’t compatible with it. Because she and Mu Chen weren’t the same. The Undying Flames were born from her bloodline. If she was to fuse with the Nether Demon Heart Lightning like what Mu Chen had done, the outcome would probably be her body exploding apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was just feeling envious, but she wasn’t drooling over&nbsp;it because she understood that if she could train in the Undying Flames to the limit, their might wouldn’t be any weaker than the Supreme Demon Heart Scripture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze also shifted to the broken stone tablet and a light flashed in his eyes. Clearly, he was greatly interested in it, but it wasn’t to the point that he would rush to comprehend it. He turned to Nine Nether and asked, “How long have I been in that state?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should have been half a month since we have come here.” Nine Nether said after counting the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We have vanished without a trace for half a month, there won’t be any problems during the Expedition War, right?” Mu Chen said after pondering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, don’t belittle our Great Havenlaw Domain. Although the Hundred Battles Domain is strong, it’s still a little weaker than our Great Havenlaw Domain. Furthermore, we have just conquered the Demonic Lightning Sect. It is a considerable achievement, so we are allowed to rest and reorganise ourselves,” smiled Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head upon hearing her words. He waved his hand and stored the Broken Tablet. “Let’s go. Let us leave and check on the training of the Nine Nether Troop first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half a month ago, he had passed the Lightning God’s Physique to the Nine Nether Troop. So he was curious how many people in the Nine Nether Troop had managed to cultivate it with the advantage of this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, his figure flew out, turning into a streak of light as he tore through the dense dark lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at his silhouette, Nine Nether smiled as well. Just when she was about to follow after, she turned her face over and glanced into the depths of the dark lightning ocean with a smear of doubt flashing in her eyes. Earlier, she vaguely felt some peculiar fluctuations coming from the depths of the lightning ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the fluctuations were too small. They were to the point that even Nine Nether had only briefly sensed them. When she attempted to sense them again, it was all quiet. She could only shake her head in doubt and swiftly follow behind Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the two of them left, the depths of the dark lightning ocean was, once again, shrouded in darkness. Except that in the depths of the darkness, there seemed to be something fluctuating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether pushed their speeds to the limits and the lightning ocean in the depths of the Demonic Lightning Abyss was torn apart half a day later with two light figures flying up. They turned into beams of light as they ascended the Demonic Lightning Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after they left the lightning ocean, there were violent thunderous rumbles resounding not far above them. On the walls of the abyss, the Demonic Earth Lightning that seemed like pythons continuously burst out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the area where the Demonic Earth Lightning was the most violent, there were a thousand figures quietly sitting down. They were like boulders that allowed the Demonic Earth Lightning to slam against their bodies. Although some of them had their skins charred black because of them, they clenched their teeth and did their utmost to endure the corrosion of the Demonic Earth Lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were the Nine Nether Troop that were currently training in the Lightning God’s Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether stood on the air as they looked at the spectacular scene before them. Gratification was shown in their eyes. With their current sight, they could naturally tell that nearly half of the Nine Nether Troop had successfully cultivated the Lightning God’s Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the so-called “cultivated it successfully” meant that they had achieved Mono Rune Lightning Physique in the Lighting God’s Physique. Furthermore, those like Qiu Shan and a few others that had reached the Sovereign Realm in their cultivation had the quickest improvements. There were already three lightning runes on their chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nine Nether and Mu Chen appeared, those whose strength were stronger, like Qiu Shan and a few others, had sensed their arrival and immediately opened their eyes. They immediately stood up and wanted to salute them, but were stopped by Nine Nether with a wave of her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How're your improvements?” Mu Chen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Report to the Commander, there are 513 that have achieved the Mono Rune Lightning Physique, and 98 who have reached the Diplo Rune Lightning Physique. But as for Triple Rune Lightning Physique, it’s only the three of us.” Qiu Shan immediately replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gently nodded his head. He was already satisfied with this speed. Right now, the strength of the Nine Nether Troop was stronger than Mu Chen when he had just started training in the Lighting God’s Physique. In addition to the help of the Demonic Earth Lightning, this speed was within Mu Chen’s expectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to this speed, it wouldn’t take a year for everyone in the Nine Nether Troop to achieve the Ennea Rune Lightning Physique in the Lighting God’s Physique. At that time, their fighting strength would definitely give others a surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Expedition War had yet to end, and Mu Chen could sense the intense battle at the end of it. So he needed everyone in the Nine Nether Troop to reach the level of at least Mono Rune Lightning Physique in their Lighting God’s Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can still rest for about half a month.” Nine Nether said, knowing what Mu Chen was thinking when she saw his pondering expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I will stay here for half a month.” Mu Chen decisively said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, I will go oversee the Demonic Lightning Sect in case there might be some chaos if we disappear for too long.” Nine Nether lightly smiled. The resources in the Demonic Lightning Sect was rich, so it would easily attract the attention of others. Just Tang Bing alone still couldn’t oversee this, and she couldn’t stay missing all the time.</span></p>

Seeing his response, Nine Nether no longer remained there. Her figure moved, turning into a streak of light and flew out of the Demonic Lightning Abyss.</span></p>

His face turned serious as he clenched his fist.

The lightning that was initially violent was actually trembling at this moment. They didn’t dare come into contact with Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy.</span></p>

Black lightning violently swept over from every single direction, nearly covering their sights and poured down in torrents towards them without the slightest leniency.</span></p>
