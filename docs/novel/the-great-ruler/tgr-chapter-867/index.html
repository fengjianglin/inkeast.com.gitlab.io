The entire region was like a death realm that made one’s blood run cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

The disorderly yells of battle made this Death Ruin extremely bustling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen had lead the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party into the Death Ruin, the pace of the party had been pushed to the limits, like a spear that couldn’t he stopped, as they swiftly made their way deep into the Death Ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But under their swift entry, they quickly saw the obstruction in this Death Ruin. It was thousands of zombie warriors. Those warriors were donned in rotten armour and their bodies had all been mummified and looked like skeletons. Only crimson lights still flickered in their caved-in eye sockets, emanating an ominous aura that was similar to the destruction of all things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was these zombie warriors that obstructed the invaders and boundless Spiritual Energy was emitting from their bodies as they fought an intense battle with the invaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These warriors that were emitting a rotten aura all over their bodies had lost their rationale, like walking corpses that did not know of pain and fearlessly charged forth. Furthermore, their attacks were extremely coordinated, moving as one. The Spiritual Energy mixed with the rotten aura had fused together, bursting forth with an extremely powerful destructive power. There were many powerful forces that had fallen by their hands, since they were caught unprepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These zombie warriors…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the highly coordinated zombie warriors and his eyes narrowed. He exchanged a glance with Nine Nether and his gaze turned solemn. That’s because they realised that the aura on these zombie warriors was actually the same as the senior from the Ancient Haven Palace that they had previously encountered in their first ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These warriors have all suffered the invasion of evil aura and had their bodies decayed. This is why they look like this now.” Nine Nether said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Fiend Clan?” Hearing her explanation, the expressions of the Mountain Splitting King and the rest had become grave. Although the primordial war was a long time ago, they still knew how terrifying the Fiend Clans were despite the passing of the ages. Those foreign invaders were the common enemy of all life forms in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be cautious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen reminded before skimming forth. Behind him, the army had also received his orders and started to be on alert with boundless Battle Will rippling and their cautious gazes watching the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The massive army was like a storm that swept past. Perhaps it might’ve been because their party was too powerful, but those zombie warriors did not obstruct them and allowed them to pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen did not feel relieved when the zombie warriors let them pass and had inwardly tensed his heart. His gaze was also more alert as he watched the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his alertness had quickly proven that he was right. When they swept through the darkness, violent Battle Will undulations suddenly burst from a cave of darkness. In the next instant, a current had swept out that was filled with a rotten scent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That current was a powerful Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen squinted his eyes and his gaze had gathered towards the cave, where he saw a few thousand mummified figures rising as a boundless Battle Will rose. But that Battle Will did not give him a flaring feel. It was filled with eerie death fluctuations instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Mu, you don’t need to deal with these fellows. Leave it to my Spiritual Swordsmen.” The Spiritual Sword King looked at the obstructing zombie troop as he gave Mu Chen a laugh. He had waved his hand and the Spiritual Swordsmen unleashed a deep roar with boundless Battle Will spreading out, forming into a figure wielding a sword above the Spiritual Swordsmen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That light figure was formed with Battle Will. It was the Battle Will Spirit of the Spiritual Swordsmen that was formed under Mu Chen’s help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz! Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Torrential sounds of sword’s ringing rang out as the huge figure furiously slashed the huge sword in its hands down. Numerous hundred-feet sword beams swept out. They were filled with powerful Battle Wills in each of those sword beams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword beams were like smears of light that streaked across the horizon and instantly tore the black current of Battle Will that was whistling over apart. Thereafter, the figure had executed its Battle Will to the limits and the sword beams flew out in every direction, enveloping the zombie troop that was numbered in the thousands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The confrontation of the two parties had instantly caused the Battle Wills to sweep out, instantly piercing the heavens and earth with holes. But under this ferocious confrontation, it was the Battle Will Spirit that wielded the sword that was even more ferocious. As Battle Will undulated, the zombie troop was swiftly defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the zombie troop was reduced to dust, it was as if a free smile had appeared on their mummified faces. It wasn’t their remnant conscious but an instinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With those zombie warriors turning into ash, a majestic abnormal energy had rippled out, which made the eyes of Mu Chen and the rest light up. That’s because that energy was the Fallen Origin Aura that they needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Sword King laughed as he waved his sleeve and had completely sucked the massive Fallen Origin Aura over. He refined into a few thousand Fallen Origin Pellets in less than ten breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such an amount was already comparable to the harvest of a Grade-3 Ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Death Ruin is definitely a Grade-1 Ruin.” The eyes of the Mountain Splitting King and the rest had their eyes turned red as they cursed the Spiritual Sword King for being cunning in their hearts, since he had made his move so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Many thanks to King Mu for helping me form the Battle Will Spirit. Otherwise, my Spiritual Swordsmen would definitely have to pay some price to deal with them.” The Spiritual Sword King cupped his fists towards Mu Chen and politely smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Spiritual Swordsmen still had not formed the Battle Will Spirit when they fought with the zombie troop, they would definitely have had to pay some price, even if they could obtain the final victory. But with the help of the Battle Will Spirit, they had not suffered any losses. The increment in their fighting power was not just a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled towards the Mountain Splitting King and the rest. “This is just the beginning. If we go deeper, I’m afraid that it’s impossible even if you guys don’t want to help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King and the rest licked their lips when they heard Mu Chen’s words. They all looked excited without the slightest fear. The good beginning had clearly roused their hunting intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let us increase our speed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked far ahead and could sense the violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations everywhere in this Death Ruin. The other forces must have sensed the zombie troop possessing large amounts of Fallen Origin Aura as well. Compared to ordinary Grade-3 Ruins, the amount of Fallen Origin Aura here was rather larger. So right now, they had to quicken their hunting speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had directed his gaze towards the deepest part of the Death Ruin with a flash of graveness in in his eyes. Judging from the current situation, practically all of the experts here had suffered the invasion of evil aura. So he had no idea about the situation regarding the Battle Formation Master that they had been seeking. If that was the case as well, then at the end of this journey...they might have to face a Battle Formation Master that had been invaded with evil aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had no idea, in regards to the strength of that Battle Formation Master under this situation, the weakest Battle Formation Master was still a horrifying existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if they were to retreat at this point in time, they would definitely feel extremely unresigned. Therefore, even if this was a dragon’s pond or tiger’s cave, they still had to make an attempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The path of an expert required one to be fearless to begin with.</span></p>

He waved his hand and flew forth. Behind him, the army swept over with a trembling momentum that made many forces surprised.</span></p>

There were over a thousand pathetic-looking figures shooting over with blood flowing from their bodies. The Spiritual Energy undulations around them were also extremely chaotic and withered.</span></p>
