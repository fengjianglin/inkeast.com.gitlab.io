 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Lord rejects your offer!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Great Havenlaw Ruler’s ethereal voice rang out in the region, the region, which still had a little commotion, turned completely quiet at this moment. Countless experts had their eyes wide open with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Mu Chen and Nine Nether, who were preparing to make a run for it, were stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even someone as powerful as Liu Tiandao was briefly stunned before dimly looking at the Great Havenlaw Ruler, feeling as if he had heard incorrectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The many faces of the Hundred Battles Domain faction were stunned as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had expected that the Great Havenlaw Ruler would actually reject such an attractive offer from the Sky Profound Palace and choose to protect the Nine Nether King and an even smaller Commander…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The callous Great Havenlaw Ruler suddenly turned into a super philanthropist? Many people had weird expressions, why did they feel a huge irony?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the Great Havenlaw Ruler, the Sky Vulture Emperor, who had a stiff expression, couldn’t help feeling relieved as he looked at the former with gratitude filling his eyes. He had followed the Great Havenlaw Ruler for so many years, so he naturally knew that the former was callous. Earlier, he originally thought that, with his character, the Great Havenlaw Ruler would choose to give up on Nine Nether and Mu Chen. But who could have imagined… that the situation would turn out like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Pupils Emperor’s face slightly changed, but he did not speak a word. The Sleeping Emperor also looked at the Great Havenlaw Ruler with astonishment, before looking at Mu Chen and Nine Nether with thoughts flashing in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Havenlaw Ruler, do you know what you are saying?!” Liu Tiandao was, after all, a powerful Earth Sovereign expert. When he recovered from the shock, anger finally appeared in his indifferent expression as he coldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Lord knows what he is doing, I do not need you to teach me.” The Great Havenlaw Ruler’s voice was calm as he continued, “They are the men of my Great Havenlaw Domain, so this Lord will naturally protect them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, since when did the cold-hearted Great Havenlaw Ruler talk about ties? Are you insulting my intelligence?” Liu Tiandao laughed from the extreme anger. In this Greatlaw Continent, where the strong devours the weak, as long as there was sufficient benefit, anything could be betrayed. Not to mention a Fifth Grade Sovereign and a puny Second Grade Sovereign Commander. Therefore, Liu Tiandao found the Great Havenlaw Ruler’s choice funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve recently been feeling like becoming a good person. You don’t agree to it?” Great Havenlaw Ruler sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Veins popped on Liu Tiandao’s forehead as he deeply inhaled a mouthful of air and darkly said, “The two of them have robbed the treasure that my son had bought, and they even invited an Earth Sovereign to suppress him, causing him to lose his Spiritual Energy. If I, Liu Tiandao, does not get to pay this enmity, I’m afraid that I will not have the face to stay in the Northern Region in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, what rubbish. Liu Ming was the one that had his eyes on our treasures. Making use of the fact that there were Elders following him, he attempted to kill us. We only protected ourselves and he deserved it as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing such a firm tone from the Great Havenlaw Ruler, Mu Chen felt relieved and couldn't help sneering, “As for the expert that sealed him, it was the Mistress of the Martial Realm. If your Sky Profound Palace is courageous enough, then try finding trouble with the Martial Realm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen spoke out, the entire region was filled with shock. Even the Spiritual Energies around Liu Tiandao and the Great Havenlaw Ruler rippled. Clearly, the words “Mistress of the Martial Realm” had given them quite a huge shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Martial Realm, a true towering figure in the Great Thousand World. Although the Great Havenlaw Domain and Sky Profound Palace were peak forces in the Northern Region, they were nothing compared to the Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Liu Tiandao had a hundred guts, he would not dare to look for trouble with the Mistress of the Martial Realm, Ling Qingzhu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen mentioned the name of the Martial Realm because we was well-aware of this fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s eyes were ill as he looked at Mu Chen and eerily said, “You are the one speaking nonsense. What are you? You think you can invite the Mistress of the Martial Realm? What a joke!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he spoke this way, the corner of his lips couldn’t stop twitching, since he had personally witnessed the spiritual mountain that suppressed Liu Ming. It was a seal that even he couldn’t break. In the end, he had to invite a big shot in order to free Liu Ming. Clearly, it was more terrifying compared to ordinary Earth Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And, clearly, the Mistress of the Martial Realm had that capability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s gaze flickered as the eeriness gathered in his eyes. It didn’t matter if the Mistress of the Martial Realm was the one who acted, as long as he could deal with Mu Chen and Nine Nether, it was enough to vent the anger in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He refused to believe that with such low strength, Mu Chen could have connections with the terrifying Mistress of the Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the Great Havenlaw Ruler refuses to hand them over, then I can only personally do it myself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao took a step forth, instantly causing the sky to turn dark. He stretched his hand out and firmly clenched towards Mu Chen and Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space around the two of them exploded practically in an instant as multi-coloured Spiritual Energy that seemed substantial came out from the space, forming into a Spiritual Energy cage that bound around the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cage flickered with a lustre of metal. It was purely formed from Spiritual Energies, being tough and indestructible. The quality of it far exceeded the imaginations of Mu Chen and Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the mark of an Earth Sovereign expert, to be able to extract the pure Spiritual Energies of the heavens and earth to this degree. The undulation that emitted from his actions far exceeded the power of the Divine Art that Mu Chen executed and Nine Nether’s control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s faces changed as vast Spiritual Energy burst out from their bodies. But even under their all-out attacks, they could not make the Spiritual Energy cage to budge in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The means of an Earth Sovereign expert clearly far exceeded what they could confront.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, I’m afraid that you don’t have the capabilities to seize them before me!” The Great Havenlaw Ruler’s cold voice rang out as he flicked his finger. A beam of light made of extremely pure Spiritual Energy was shot towards the cage. Mu Chen and Nine Nether saw cracks appear on the cage, before it shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them retreated to the camp of the Great Havenlaw Domain with shock in their eyes. This was the strength of an Earth Sovereign? It was truly powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s face was ice-cold as he abruptly raised his hand. Thereafter, everyone could sense the Spiritual Energy in the region violently gathering in the sky above him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy that was gathered was sucked into Liu Tiandao’s mouth and the vast ocean of Spiritual Energy was gathered into his body, before being spat out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A silver river of Spiritual Energy was spat out from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Spiritual Energy force that had been substantially refined with countless grains of his own Spiritual Energy within it. With only a breath, Liu Tiandao had already purified the Spiritual Energy of the heavens and earth to such a degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just this alone was something that a Ninth Grade Sovereign could not accomplish. Not to mention that it was all done in a few breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver river flickered and distorted as it turned into a thousand foot long sword of stars. The sword was filled with ancient and cryptic sword runes. In an instant, a surge of Sword Aura that made everyone feel a numbing sensation on their scalps soared into the horizon. As the Sword Aura flew past, there was a long cracked mark on the void space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It has been a long time since we last fought, so let me witness how much you have improved after all these years!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao coldly smiled as his gaze turned cold and pointed down with both of his fingers, “Sword of the Heavenly Dao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge sword with stars gathered on it had directly pierced through space then appeared in the sky above the Great Havenlaw Ruler. There wasn’t any hesitation the moment it furiously slashed down. A thousand foot black gap appeared as the space was torn apart in the path of the sword light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying destructive ability made countless experts feel a numbing sensation on their scalps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seated on the throne, the Great Havenlaw Ruler watched as the sword of stars flashed down. He seemed to have opened his mouth and lightly spat a surge of blackness that soared into the sky. Rustling noises was heard as a large and weird black spike grew out, instantly turning into a spike forest in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the huge sword of stars got near the spike forest, instead of withering, spikes shot out and coiled around the sword. It made the sword seem like it had entered into a swamp as it slowed down and stopped in the spike forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Havenlaw Ruler made a flick with his finger and a piercing noise burst out from the black spikes. Those spikes turned into a huge dragon and as they coiled, they shattered the sword of light into sparkles of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strangeness in this method of fighting made others feel astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Failing in his attack, Liu Tiandao’s face grew slightly dark as he took a step forth and appeared before the Great Havenlaw Ruler. He threw two palms forth. The palms looked like they were calmly moving. But everyone could sense a fine trembling from the space itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the gently movements of Liu Tiandao’s palms, the energies held within were even more terrifying than the huge sword attack that he had unleashed earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any fear in the Great Havenlaw Ruler as he threw his palms, enveloped in light, up as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two palms heavily clashed together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any shocking noise that burst out from their clash, but everyone had widened their mouths as they looked towards the sky. A ten thousand foot radius around those two had turned into a huge black hole. Space was shattered from the energy that came from the two’s palms…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that their control of strength had reached great heights. So there wasn’t any booming noise, compared to the battles of Mu Chen and the rest. But the pressure that emanated from them was sufficient to make every single expert’s hair to stand on end. If that sort of attack was slightly leaked out, it would probably cause great patches of death and injuries…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two figures trembled in the black hole as they flew back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao took thirteen steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Great Havenlaw Ruler, he only took five steps back. However, because of the Spiritual Energy clash between the two, the Spiritual Energy light that enveloped him had been dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the light dissipated, a figure was revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single expert in this region had directed their gazes over as they widened their mouths with their eyes narrowed shortly after. Their gazes were filled with disbelief and shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also overwhelmed with shock as he opened his mouth. Because when the light dissipated, it was actually a petite figure that appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wore black clothes with her hair draped down. Although there wasn’t any expression on her pretty little face, there was an exquisite cuteness on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And that familiar appearance… it was naturally the mysterious Mandala that had been previously following Mu Chen around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was actually the Commander of the Great Havenlaw Domain!</span></p>
