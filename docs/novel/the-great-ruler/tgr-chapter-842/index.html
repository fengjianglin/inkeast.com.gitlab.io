 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s expression turned grave as she looked at Mu Chen, who had a slightly bad expression. Clearly, they had lost their calm from the sudden rescue signal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a total of nine troops amongst the Kings, and they could be considered as the backbone of the Great Havenlaw Domain. If one of them was annihilated, it would definitely be a great blow to the Great Havenlaw Domain’s strength in general. And the Hunting War was extremely brutal, so if they wanted to survive, they definitely had to save every last strand of their power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Mu Chen and Nine Nether were startled by the fact that a King had resorted to the rescue signal when not even a day had passed in the Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was very clear of the temperament of the other Kings, they were prideful, since they were all elites of the Great Havenlaw Domain. Even in the Northern Region, they could be a famous expert. Adding on to them having a powerful troop under them, it must’ve been a last resort to force a King to use the rescue signal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder which King is seeking help… Furthermore, who have they encountered? To be actually forced to this step.” Nine Nether gently clenched her fists as she slowly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shook his head. The bronze mirror could only indicate the rescue signal and not the person that called for it. It was impossible for other information to be transmitted over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right now, the top powerhouses of the various forces are searching for the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasuries, so I believe it must be the other peak forces that forced a King force of ours to such a degree.” Mu Chen calmly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore… it’s highly possible that they fell into a trap.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether narrowed her eyes and looked at Mu Chen. “What do you think we should do? If that’s the case, then we might throw ourselves in it if we head there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen briefly hesitated, before deeply inhaling, “No matter how dangerous it is, we still have to make the trip. We can’t stand by and watch a King force being annihilated. Mandala had also said it that it’s impossible for us to explore deep into the Fallen Battlefield alone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether nodded her head in agreement and somewhat admired Mu Chen’s actions. Although the various Kings were all under the Great Havenlaw Domain, there were competitions between them and there would be some conflicts. Take their Nine Nether Troop and the Blood Hawk Hall, for example, they didn’t have a harmonious relationship. Therefore, Nine Nether somewhat admired Mu Chen for being able to decide to help upon receiving the rescue signal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s not delay and get moving!” Mu Chen looked at Nine Nether, before shifting his gaze onto the fully-armed Nine Nether Troop. He did not speak much, then he waved his hand and flew into the sky first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, Nine Nether and the Nine Nether Troop followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time was tight and Mu Chen had basically sped as fast as he could with this troop towards the direction indicated on the bronze mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, they had encountered many forces, but they had all looked at the Nine Nether Troop that was whistling with killing aura with shock, no one dared to go up and obstruct them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they had travelled at their top speed, they had finally reached the region that the rescue signal came from after roughly an hour later. Not long after entering this region, they had also obtained some intelligence and their expressions turned extremely grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they had expected, the one that had made a move against the Great Havenlaw Domain was not only a peak force, it was the most resounding force in the entire Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Pavilion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a colossus that had experienced five Hunting Wars. In terms of foundation, it was probably the oldest force in the Northern Region and even their Great Havenlaw Domain could not be compared to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to the intelligence that we have just gathered, it should be the Blood Hawk Hall that has fallen for the trap.” Nine Nether looked at Mu Chen as she flung her lips aside, feeling a little helpless. However, it was also a little unexpected for her that the one activating the rescue signal would actually be the Blood Hawk Hall, whom they had many conflicts with. In the Great Havenlaw Domain, their forces could not be considered as friends, they even had slight enmity between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And the one that forced them into the desperate situation should be the Skycroc Troop, led by the Croc Mount's Lord of the Divine Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Croc Mount's Lord…” Mu Chen lightly frowned his brows. He was no longer that inexperienced and ignorant fellow, he had a good grasp of the other peak forces as well. In the Divine Pavilion, the ruler was the Divine Pavilion Master, with the North, South, East and West Pavilion Lords under him. They were comparable to the Three Emperors of their Great Havenlaw Domain. Beneath the four Pavilion Lords were the ten Mount Lords, named with ferocious flying beasts like this Croc Mount's Lord…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And that enemy of mine, enemies are indeed on a narrow road.” Mu Chen looked towards that direction and helplessly smiled. That’s because it was not only the Croc Mount's Lord of the Divine Pavilion that acted against the Blood Hawk Hall. There was also a familiar figure, Fang Yi of the Divine Pavilion. He had once been beaten to a miserable state by Cai Xiao and fled, but he could still firmly sit on the first ranking of the Dragon-Phoenix Record.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Cai Xiao had a good relation, with Cai Xiao’s departure and her identity as the daughter of the Flame Emperor, even if Fang Yi was ten times more courageous, he wouldn’t dare to go to the Endless Fire Territory to look for trouble with her. Therefore, he could only divert his anger towards Mu Chen. Thus, Mu Chen could practically imagine how furious Fang Yi would be when they meet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, a great battle would definitely be unavoidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this Overlord of the Dragon-Phoenix Record of the Northern Region for so many years, even Mu Chen wasn’t confident in defeating Fang Yi, despite breaking through to Fourth Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because he knew that Fang Yi wasn’t an easy opponent. Therefore, it was impossible for the latter to remain stagnant when he had improved. With the resources of the Divine Pavilion, the cultivation speed and cards Fang Yi had up his sleeves would definitely be stunning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Mu Chen wasn’t an unparalleled monster like Cai Xiao that specialised in torturing geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Blood Hawk Hall was forced into a valley a few hundred miles away and is completely surrounded. The Divine Pavilion has caused quite a big scene on this and attracted many forces over. After all, the battle of peak forces is rather attractive.” Nine Nether gently shrugged. In the Hunting War, the battle between peak forces was the most entertaining and cruel. And now, it was their Great Havenlaw Domain and the Divine Pavilion, god-knows how many people would be attracted by it. So if the breeze was to slightly spread the information about it, it would definitely attract innumerable amounts of attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since it was that bastard, Blood Hawk King, why don’t we skip on this?” Nine Nether was a little vexed as she looked at Mu Chen. From the side, Qiu Shan and the rest had also looked at Mu Chen as they awaited his decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rubbed his forehead and couldn’t help cursing. Clearly, he was slightly at a loss about this matter. After all, their Nine Nether Palace didn’t have a good relationship with the Blood Hawk Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was the other Kings, Mu Chen would definitely not hesitate. But since it was the Blood Hawk King, he felt a slight headache at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although I don’t like that fellow, we’re members of the Great Havenlaw Domain. It’s definitely unfavourable for us to watch the Divine Pavilion annihilate them.” Mu Chen deeply inhaled a breath as he suppressed the prejudice he had for the Blood Hawk King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our grudges will be resolved with our own ability, not depending on others to deal with them. After saving them, if they still dare to be rude, I will put them in order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Shan and the rest looked at Mu Chen, who was slightly domineering, and couldn’t help having the fire burning in their eyes. They knew that under Mu Chen’s hands, the strength of their Nine Nether Troop had far surpassed the Blood Hawk Troop. Therefore, Mu Chen had the ability and qualifications to speak such words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at Nine Nether and no longer hesitated after seeing the latter gently nod her head. His foot left the ground and turned into a streak of light.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there was a huge group of people in the valley. They wore blood-coloured armour and their gazes were somewhat sharp. However, the boundless Battle Will that they had gathered was a little chaotic at this moment, since they had clearly been heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the centre of this troop, the Blood Hawk King, who wore blood-coloured armour, looked outside the valley with a solemn expression. He could vaguely see innumerable figures floating outside, with a powerful Battle Will sealing off this valley, not allowing them to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Lord, our Blood Hawk Troop has lost nearly a thousand…” Beside the Blood Hawk King, Wu Tian, who was covered in blood, softly said. His face, which was initially cold and sharp, was filled with guilt and sadness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Blood Hawk King’s body trembled. A thousand soldiers from the Blood Hawk Troop, that was practically a fifth of the entire troop. It was a number that had been nurtured with a large number of resources and energy. But, right now, they had died in barely half an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Skycroc Troop has us surrounded and has sealed off this place. My Lord, I will lead the Blood Hawk Troop to fight to the death and tear the blockade apart while my Lord swiftly leaves this place!” Wu Tian wiped the traces of blood on his face as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Hawk King’s eyes turned sharp as he barked, “You want this King to flee like a homeless dog? How is this King going to have a footing in the Great Havenlaw Domain in the future? If they are to attack us later, all of you will charge out with me. Since they think that our Blood Hawk Hall is a pushover, then I’ll let them be prepared to be bitten back by my Blood Hawk Hall!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King’s face was filled with ferocity, since the ferocious character that was deep down in his bones had been completely aroused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Lord need not worry, we have already sent out a rescue signal. As long as we can drag this out a little more, our reinforcement will definitely come!” Wu Tian hastily advised when he saw the Blood Hawk King having the intentions to engage in a life-and-death struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re out of time.” The Blood Hawk King shook his head and his sharp gaze looked towards the sky of the valley. The boundless Battle Will had already started to press towards the valley and the Skycroc Troop had clearly chosen to launch their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Hawk Troop in the valley had sensed the Battle Will spreading over and they tightened their grips on their halberds as they prepared themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Hawk King took in a deep breath and clenched his fist. A blood-coloured halberd appeared in a flash and a powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuation spread out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when the Blood Hawk King was prepared to fight to the death, his eyes suddenly narrowed as he saw a slightly chaotic fluctuation in the vast Battle Will of the Skycroc Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Lord, our reinforcement have arrived!” Wu Tian instantly rejoiced at this scene, since he could sense a similarly powerful Battle Will swiftly spreading over that wasn’t inferior to the Skycroc Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder, which King is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King’s sharp gaze stared at the distance and the expression on his face became complicated. He briefly hesitated, before speaking in a soft voice, “It’s the Nine Nether King and King Mu.”</span></p>
