 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Mu Chen had obtained this object, this was the first time that it had a response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This object was extremely mysterious and was obviously placed in the spatial crack by someone to hide it. If it wasn’t for the Spiritual Compass, Mu Chen definitely wouldn’t be able to find it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Mu Chen’s guesses, this object should be greatly related to the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury but it required a special way of using it. That’s because Mu Chen couldn’t control it even if he had poured his Spiritual Energy into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But fortunately, this thing had responded right now…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it because of those light lumps?” Mu Chen’s eyes lightly flickered as his gaze shot towards the five streaks of light at the centre of the lake. Many experts were trying to capture them at this moment, but no one had succeeded. It’s as if those five lumps of light had intelligence that knew how to dodge attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black triangular metal only had a response when Mu Chen had entered the centre of this lake. Therefore, Mu Chen was almost certain that it was caused by those lumps of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To prove his guess, Mu Chen had suddenly increased his speed and swiftly made his way towards those lumps of light. As he approached them, he realised that the black triangle metal had heated up even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s really the case…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze was bright, since he didn’t know if it was his misconception. When he started to approach those lumps of light, those lumps of light seemed to have slowed down a little. As if they had sensed something familiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This item is indeed useful!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had noticed that the lump of light was especially radiant. It was more than a fold dazzling compared to the rest. With a look, he could tell that it definitely wasn’t simple. Previously, when many experts tried to capture it, the lump of light had fled from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those lumps of light appeared to be able to shuttle through space with moves that made even Sixth Grade Sovereigns helpless against. However, those lumps of light clearly couldn’t escape from this lake. Otherwise, not even the Sleeping Emperor and the rest would catch up to them if they escaped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s target was extremely obvious. But when the other experts saw him making his way over to that lump of light, they couldn’t help smiling in ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because, earlier, they had seen how swift those lumps of light were. Nearly ten Sixth Grade Sovereigns attempted to obstruct it earlier, but were instead messed around by that lump of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although everyone was fearful of the strength that Mu Chen had displayed when he fought with the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi, brute strength was clearly useless at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the experts that were originally in front of Mu Chen had opened up a path, allowing Mu Chen to chase after that lump of light, since they had clearly intended to watch him suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen couldn’t be bothered about the thoughts of others. Without any obstructions, his silhouette had flickered and he was already within a hundred feet from that lump of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone saw that Mu Chen actually managed to be within a hundred feet of that lump of light, not only were they not anxious, they even slowed down their speed with interest and smiled with their eyes narrowed at this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had noticed those people trying to watch as he made a fool of himself. Immediately, the corner of his lips rose into an unnoticeable arc, since he had discovered that the black triangle metal had become even more heated. It was akin to magma…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his hand with the black metal facing the rippling lump of light that was about to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, Mu Chen could clearly sense that the black metal in his hand had violently trembled, akin to an unnoticeable buzzing noise that rippled out in the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the atmosphere buzzed, the lump of light that was a hundred feet away, which was about to escape, suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also at that instant when a light surged in Mu Chen’s eyes and a lustre blossomed on his black. A pair of phoenix wings unfolded and his speed had reached the limit in that instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only a flicker and he had already travelled a hundred feet. When Mu Chen appeared above that lump of light, his hand was like a bolt of lightning, entering the lump of light and grabbed the item in it before anyone could respond to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, when Mu Chen grabbed onto that lump of light, the entire lake was silent and those people that were initially intending to watch Mu Chen make a fool of himself had their expressions frozen. The dumbfounded looks on their faces was extremely funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He… he… he grabbed onto that lump of light?!” After a long while later, finally an exclamation resounded. Except that voice stuttered, which reflected the violent waves in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had never expected that the item that so many of them had tried to capture would be so easily obtained by Mu Chen…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is that possible…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was a little dumbfounded as they felt a pain in their hearts following after. That lump of light was the most radiant one, so the item in it definitely wouldn’t be simple. It might even be the Spiritual Divine Liquid that they were all after. But it was actually so easily obtained by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impact of this scene came even stronger than when Mu Chen had defeated the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless dumbfounded gazes, Mu Chen was also slightly stunned. This outcome had also exceeded his expectations. He only wanted to try capturing it, but he never expected that the lump of light wouldn’t move from his approach, allowing him to take it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, this was all because of the mysterious black metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being briefly stunned, joy swiftly reflected in Mu Chen’s eyes and he had immediately burst in retreat. At the same time, the experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain had also flown out, clearly intending to receive Mu Chen. At this moment, the latter would easily be targeted by all the other forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had reacted very quickly in addition to the intimidation that he had sent out when he defeated the Netherworld Prince and Fang Yi, despite the fact that all the experts wanted to make a move, but that brief moment of hesitation had allowed Mu Chen to escape from this chaotic region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when Mu Chen was about to feel relieved, a thunderous roar had resounded from the horizon, “Brat, hand that over!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the roar resounded, an unparalleled finger storm swept down that even tore space apart and was aimed towards Mu Chen’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden attack had given Mu Chen a fright. But fortunately, he was on guard at all moments and the phoenix wings on his back had flapped as he dodged that attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sharp attack had streamed across Mu Chen’s back and he felt a stinging pain. But Mu Chen couldn’t be bothered about that pain at this moment. He darkly raised his head. Up ahead was a red-robed elderly man that slowly descended. That person had a sharp gaze, akin to a viper that was fixed onto Mu Chen, along with powerful Spiritual Energy undulations around him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw that elder, his heart slightly sank. That’s because this person was the South Pavilion Lord of the Divine Pavilion’s Four Pavilion Lords. This person had not made a move, even the task of obstructing the three Emperors was left to the other three Pavilion Lords while he hid in the dark, waiting for opportunities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And right now, he had clearly placed his eye onto Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the rear, when Nine Nether and the rest saw that Mu Chen was targeted by the South Pavilion Lord, their faces drastically changed and they swiftly increased their speed. But the space before them had distorted and several silhouettes had appeared before them, the experts of the Divine Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe. I think you guys can just stay here!” The leader of that group, the Sky Dragon Lord, laughed as he waved his hand down. The experts behind him pounced forth like ferocious tigers as they obstructed the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party from rescuing Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The chaotic situation at the rear was noticed by Mu Chen. When he realised that Nine Nether and the rest were obstructed, his heart had slightly sunk…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, hand it over to me and I can spare your life. Otherwise, today is your doomsday!” The red-robed elder slowly said as he stared at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that it would definitely attract mockery onto himself if he were to make a move towards Mu Chen. But he couldn’t be bothered about that at this moment. If the Spiritual Divine Liquid fell into the hands of the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Divine Pavilion Master would definitely be enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Divine Pavilion is really shameless. One of the Pavilion Lords actually has the face to deal with someone of the younger generation like me?” Mu Chen’s face sunk as he coldly sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t try to delay time. If you don’t want to hand it over by yourself, then I can only take it from you myself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The South Pavilion Lord wasn’t affected by Mu Chen’s mockery. He eerily smiled before waving his hand. He had pounced towards Mu Chen with his robes fluttering in the wind. Boundless Spiritual Energy exploded with a pressure that even made Mu Chen feel difficulty to breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if the rock island had suppressed Spiritual Energy, the South Pavilion Lord could easily crush any Sixth Grade Sovereign with his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the South Pavilion Lord that was pouncing over like a hawk and his gaze had slowly turned ferocious. Since this old goat was trying to force his hand, then he could only bring out some of his trump cards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his thoughts circulated, an old stone chessboard had suddenly appeared in Mu Chen’s hand with a flash.</span></p>
