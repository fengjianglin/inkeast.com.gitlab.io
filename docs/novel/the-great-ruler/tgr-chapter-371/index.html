 <p><strong>Chapter 371 - Nine Heavy Mountain Array</strong></p>
 <p>Bang! Rumble!</p>
 <p>Nine gold-coloured divine mountains towered within this Spiritual Light world. Golden light gushed and flowed out of them, causing them to appear akin to the residences of gods, while radiating with Spiritual Energy pressure that caused people’s hearts to tremble.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s expression turned grave, since the Spiritual Array that Wu Jia had arranged might be no weaker than the double lotus formation of his Demonic Butchering Lotus Spiritual Array. This Wu Jia really had some ability.</p>
 <p>Far across the horizon, Wu Jia continued sending an indifferent gaze out towards Mu Chen. Within saying anymore words, he waved his sleeves, causing the nine gold-coloured divine mountains to instantly vibrate as a gold-coloured wave of air swept out from them.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A gold-coloured divine mountain rushed to the skies. Carrying along a shadow that hid the skies and covered the earth, with an indescribably overbearing attitude, it brought along its golden glow as it pressed straight down towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>The air under the gold-coloured divine mountain instantly exploded, while distortions appeared in the surrounding space.</p>
 <p>Facing such an attack, even people whose strength had reached Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase might not dare to show to slightest bit of contempt.</p>
 <p>As the gold-coloured divine mountain grew larger within Mu Chen’s eyes, he exhaled a long breath of air. In the next instant, his gaze turned sharp and fierce. Tightly clenching his hands into fists, he sent a fist rumbling out.</p>
 <p>Boundless Spiritual Energy transformed into a starry sky behind him as a white tiger condensed together, roaring towards the sky. Transforming into a streak of light, it accompanied Mu Chen’s fist, howling through the sky as they violently slammed against the descending divine mountain.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Incomparably erratic Spiritual Energy storms were instantly whipped up as they expanded out. Although the gold-coloured divine mountain was sent flying back, the white tiger was shattered apart by the its frightening power, transforming into glowing dots that blotted the sky.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, a sneer appeared at the corner of Wu Jia’s mouth. With a change of his hand seal, the divine mountains came howling out, radiating with astonishing pressure.</p>
 <p>A frosty expression filled Mu Chen’s eyes as three gigantic figures condensed once again in the starry sky behind him. However, this time, the imposing aura radiating from them had become much, much stronger. Shooting out, the three figures immediately proceeded to obstruct and resist the three incoming divine mountains.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>After blocking the divine mountains, Mu Chen shot out. Black lightning started to arc and dance around his body, while a black lightning mark started to surface on his chest.</p>
 <p>Mono Rune Lightning Physique!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s speed dramatically increased, shooting straight under a divine mountain. Spiritual Energy burning with black flames explosively shot out from his body in the form of a streak of light. Tightly clenching his hand, his veins squirmed and wriggled on the top of his fist. In the next instant, his fist with lightning arcing and dancing around it, rumbled out, slamming head-on against the bottom of the divine mountain.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>As his fist made contact, the sky within this stretch of the world seemed to intensely vibrate. Gigantic cracks started to suddenly extend rapidly from the point of impact of his fist. In a short span of a few breaths, they had completely covered the divine mountain!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Under this single punch by Mu Chen, this lofty mountain that towered in the sky had completely shattered into pieces.</p>
 <p>After shattering the divine mountain with a single punch, a shadow of a dragon surfaced on his body. In a flash, he retreated a couple hundred feet away, where a divine mountain had violently pressed down on the location he was previously at.</p>
 <p>“You’ve some ability.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Mu Chen destroying a divine mountain with a single punch, a cold glint flashed within Wu Jia’s eyes. <em>This fellow seems to have cultivated a rather strong body-refinement Deity Tier Spiritual Art. If not, he wouldn’t have been able to destroy my divine mountain with his Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase strength.</em></p>
 <p>“However, do you truly think that my Nine Heavy Mountain Array would be that simple?”</p>
 <p>With a sneer, Wu Jia changed his hand seal. In the next instant, Mu Chen saw the golden divine mountain, which he had shattered into glowing bits that blotted the sky, started to condense together once again. Within a short span of a few breaths, a majestic divine mountain reappeared in his sight.</p>
 <p>“My nine divine mountains will endlessly form. No matter how many of them you shatter, they’ll condense back again, all till you’ve exhausted your strength and emptied all of your Spiritual Energy!” Bringing along ridiculement and contempt, Wu Jia’s cold voice resounded within this world.</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Mu Chen shot out once again. Transforming into a bolt of black lightning, he violent smashed against a divine mountain.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Yet another divine mountain was forcibly destroyed by Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>However, the glowing dots that filled the sky quickly converged together, before transforming back into the divine mountain, completely void of damage.</p>
 <p>Seeing Mu Chen’s futile attempts, Wu Jia gave a soft smile, containing his ridiculement and contempt towards the former. This Mu Chen truly wasn’t going to give up. After being trapped within his Nine Heavy Mountain Array, regardless of how many methods the former possessed, regardless of how remarkable he was, Mu Chen would never be able to escape from here.</p>
 <p>After destroying three divine mountains in rapid succession and saw them recondense, Mu Chen stopped continuing to waste his energy in doing pointless actions. With a sneer, he replied, “Although you have some ability, this is, after all, only a Rank 5 Spiritual Array. Furthermore, do you truly think that you’re Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master?”</p>
 <p>The Nine Heavy Mountain Array truly was somewhat formidable. However, Mu Chen didn’t believe in what Wu Jia had said. A Spiritual Array of that degree was simply not something that Wu Jia, with his qualifications, could successfully arrange.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, if what he said was true, it would have exceeded the boundaries of a Rank 5 Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, he looked towards the nine divine mountains that had encircled him. Golden light gushed and radiated out, causing them to appear as if they were cast from gold.</p>
 <p>As his black pupils reflected the images of the divine mountains, his eyes sparkled with brilliance. After a moment, he muttered out in a soft voice, “Is it real, or is it fake?”</p>
 <p>Hearing those soft words, Wu Jia’s eyes furiously contracted, before sending a dark stare towards Mu Chen. At this moment, dense killing intent erupted from his heart as he thought, <em>This fellow truly isn’t easy.</em></p>
 <p>“Of the nine divine mountains, only one should be real, right? After breaking that, your Spiritual Array shouldn’t have any more points worth commending, right?” Locking his gaze onto the dark-faced Wu Jia, Mu Chen spoke out with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“That’ll have to depend on whether you have the ability to do so.”</p>
 <p>A faint shiver shook through Wu Jia’s heart, while his expression grew increasingly dark. Changing his hand seal, the nine divine mountains instantly revolved, causing golden light to blossom across the entire sky. The golden light concealed the nine divine mountains within, causing Mu Chen to be unable to see their tracks.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Under the golden light, divine mountains came pressuring down one after another, attempting to squash Mu Chen to death.</p>
 <p>Activating the Dragon Soaring Art, Mu Chen’s figure appeared akin to a dragon’s shadow, evading the divine mountains that were attempting to suppress him from above. For those attacks that weren’t dodgeable, a fist would fiercely rumble, causing anything that was in its path to smash and shatter apart.</p>
 <p>“I have to find the real divine mountain.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the bright and eye-blinding sea of golden light, this thought ran through Mu Chen’s mind. After faintly pondering about it, he started to slowly close his eyes.</p>
 <p>Looking at Mu Chen, who had closed his eyes all of a sudden, a feeling of unease sprouted from Wu Jia’s heart for some unknown reason.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Across the horizon far away from the Western Desolated Territory, two figures with the most tyrannical Spiritual Energy fluctuations, were currently exchanging furious blows with one another. Wave after wave of Spiritual Energy shock waves swept out akin to hundred foot large waves, causing the countless gazes from the entire city to be tightly lock onto them.</p>
 <p>This was the fighting ground between Shen Cangsheng and Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Bringing along overbearing intent, a golden stream shattered apart the horizon as it pierced out.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>As a dragon roar seemed to resound out, a demonic dragon howled as it appeared, its baleful aura pervading throughout the sky. Baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, it collided head-on against the golden stream.</p>
 <p>A violent shudder seemed to spread across the sky as Spiritual Energy storms immediately followed suit.</p>
 <p>The golden glowing figure was sent flying back as the golden long spear within Shen Cangsheng’s hand heavily smashed the space below him, stabilising his body. At this moment, a few wounds had already appeared on his body. Obviously, the intense battle with Mo Longzi had resulted in him getting some light injuries.</p>
 <p>In the front of him, greyish-black Spiritual Energy pervaded with a baleful aura expanded out. At this moment, the Spiritual Energy appeared akin to a gigantic demonic dragon, with Mo Longzi floating in the air above it.</p>
 <p>Looking apathetically at Shen Cangsheng, Mo Longzi slowly pulled out the black sword hoisted on his back. This sword was somewhat broad, while bloody patterns covered the entirety of its surface. With its dark and sinister colour, it appeared akin to being formed from countless amounts of blood.</p>
 <p>“This ends here.”</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi spoke out, his voice sounding exceptionally cold and detached. Shen Cangsheng’s tenacity and toughness had exceeded his expectations. Although he knew that the latter had already touched the Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase, if they had an opportunity to meet again, the latter would have already broken through. Furthermore, at that time, Mo Longzi would truly not have any assurance that he could grasp victory within his hands.</p>
 <p>Against the Overlord of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Heavenly Rankings, dread was similarly present within Mo Longzi’s heart. This kind of opponent would become a big cancerous tumor within his heart if he were to let him go.</p>
 <p>Humm! Humm!</p>
 <p>As Mo Longzi grasped the black heavy sword within his hands, a bloodthirsty humm seemed to ring out from the body of the sword. As this continued, one could seemingly hear a demonic dragon roaring across the heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>Within the large hall in the city, upon seeing the black heavy sword in Mo Longzi’s hands, the eyes of the green-robed male slightly contracted as he muttered, “That’s the Dragon Breaking Sword of the Demonic Dragon Palace…”</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng had similarly felt the extremely dangerous fluctuations radiating from it as his expression turned grave. Clenching the Golden Lotus War God Spear tightly within his hands, Spiritual Energy gushed out of his body without the slightest restraint.</p>
 <p>He knew that Mo Longzi had already planned to forsake everything to get rid of him.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The black heavy sword rushed towards the sky as black rays of brilliance blossomed from it. Appearing akin to a demonic dragon that had broken the fetters of mortality, it proceeded to plant itself in the middle of the sky.</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi’s hands suddenly came together to form a seal as Spiritual Energy swelled and burst forth from his body. Like a thousand foot wide waterfall, it hid the skies and covered the earth as it rushed towards to sky, before completely being absorbed by the black heavy sword.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>As the heavy black sword continued absorbing Mo Longzi’s Spiritual Energy, the greyish-black Spiritual Energy quickly condensed together, while layer after layer of dragon scales started surfacing on it. After a short span of a few breaths, the black heavy sword unexpectedly transformed into a genuine demonic dragon approximately a thousand feet long.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mo Longzi opened his gigantic blood-red eyes, with endless bloodthirsty intent pervaded within them. A baleful aura pervaded throughout the world, causing the surrounding temperature to drastically drop.</p>
 <p>The demonic dragon sat in the sky, its gigantic body appeared icy-cold, as if it was cast in metal. Power and vigor radiated from it, appearing as if it could shatter the world apart. A ferocious beast of this level was enough to cause fear and terror in people on first sight.</p>
 <p>That seemed like a genuine demonic dragon!</p>
 <p>Looking at the exceptionally ferocious beast sitting in the sky, Shen Cangsheng’s face turned slightly pale. Taking a deep breath, he tightly clenched his Golden Lotus War God Spear. At this moment, he absolutely could not retreat!</p>
 <p>If he did, the other three battles would get implicated as a result.</p>
 <p>“I’ll have to risk it for this fight!”</p>
 <p>Golden light burst forth and swept out from his body, pervading throughout the world.</p>
 <p>At this moment, under the gigantic Spiritual Array that had replaced the sky, a shiver suddenly shook through Mu Chen, who was trapped within the Nine Heavy Mountain Array. Within the depths of his spirit, a single eye seemed to slowly open at this moment.</p>
