 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, what do you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Wen Qingxuan’s clear and pleasant voice, Mu Chen sunk into a deep thought. Following the elapsing of time, the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament was currently starting to gear up, with various powerful groups gradually starting to surface. The strength of those groups would not be inferior to those coming from the five Great Academies. This was something that Mu Chen had experienced earlier, with the example being Zhen Qing, whose group wasn’t weaker than Xia Hou’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, it was clear that a situation like the appearance of Zhen Qing and his group wouldn’t be a one-off. There might be even more of such similar groups present in the dark. Although Mu Chen was confident about himself, he wasn’t blind. Just as what Wen Qingxuan had said, it was extremely hard to rely solely on the strength of his group to contend against an alliance formed by numerous groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were numerous large and small remnants concealed within the fragments of this Shattered Continent. There was no one that could guarantee that a not-too-assuming group would not chance up a great opportunity, and distinguish themselves with a drastic increase of their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s more, as of now, Mu Chen’s group was currently in a phase of strength that could be said as advancing by leaps and bounds. The absolute majority of the people that were able to participate were of Heavenly Completion Stage. After the Heavenly Completion Stage would be the three Sovereign Disasters. This was a unique phase where one wouldn’t need much accumulation of bitter cultivation to progress. That’s because the tribulations by themselves were a form of tempering. As long as one was able to pass through them, one’s strength would greatly advance and rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, with the aid from the numerous ancient remnants present in this Shattered Continent, an absolute majority of the people present here would obtain great progress within the short number of months they would spend here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this phase of great transformation, whoever was able to grasp the right opportunity would be able to obtain the greatest progression of strength from their entire group, allowing them to walk at the forefront of everyone present in this Shattered Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why Mu Chen had placed such importance on the ancient remnant of the Divine Wood Palace. Although there were numerous other ancient remnants hidden within the Shattered Continent, there should not be many that were able to rival what the Divine Wood Palace held in store. Therefore, as long as they were able to enter this ancient remnant, it would definitely be extremely beneficial for him and his group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was due to this Divine Wood Palace’s remnant being that perfect that there would naturally be countless groups flocking over towards it, with truly powerful groups among their ranks. At that time, the battles that would be waged would absolutely be unable to be matched by those in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, at that time, if they were able to collaborate with a group like Wen Qingxuan’s, it would be considered as the most perfect scenario for Mu Chen and his group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did you find us for this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen asked as he looked towards Wen Qingxuan. From the surface, with their strength, if they wanted to find a group to collaborate with, there would clearly be quite a few better groups to choose from. However, she had decided to find them in the end, something that caused slight doubt to rise within Mu Chen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because I believe in Luo Li,” replied Wen Qingxuan with a sweet smile as she looked towards Mu Chen. A bright and beautiful smile surfaced on her beautiful, snow-white face as she said in a teasing fashion, “Could it be that Captain Mu Chen had assumed that I’ve fallen for him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen gave an embarrassed laugh. He wouldn’t be tricked into her claim of having fallen for him. Furthermore, it was extremely hard for him to imagine that an extremely opinionated girl like her would change her mind for a male.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li has helped me before. Perhaps it might be accidental of her. However, I’m unable to not repay this favor. I’m clear about Luo Li’s strength. As for you…” Shooting a sizing gaze around Mu Chen’s body with her beautiful eyes, Wen Qingxuan slightly raised her red lips before saying, “From our exchange earlier, you really do possess some ability. Therefore, it can be considered that we didn’t suffer any losses coming here to collaborate with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m truly honored,” replied Mu Chen in an unhappy tone as he shook his head. This Wen Qingxuan truly is extremely hard to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t like collaborating with you men. Therefore, if you say that you’re honored, it’s indeed quite an honor to do so,” said Wen Qingxuan earnestly as she nodded her head, sounding exceedingly impressive as she did so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Mu Chen to become speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen appearing as if he had hit a wall, Luo Li could not help giving w soft laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay. I agree to collaborate,” replied Mu Chen as he nodded his head. Turning around, he pointed towards Xu Huang and the other two and said, “These are my group members, Xu Huang, Zhao Qingshan and Mu Fengyang. They’ve just broke through their Human Body Disaster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shooting a mere glance at the trio, Wen Qingxuan withdrew her gaze in an instant, before nodding her head in a de-emphasizing manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Noticing the attitude she had towards them, Xu Huang and the other two could not help bitterly laughing in their hearts, but did not dare to show one bit of discontentment on their faces. Although the girl before them was as beautiful as Luo Li, those pair of beautiful phoenix-like eyes always seemed to possess more than sufficient feelings of encroachment. If it were people or things that didn’t garner her interest, her silence and faint smile was more than enough to make many people feel ashamed of their inferiority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only at this moment did they understand exactly how easy it was to get near Luo Li, who always appeared quiet and would only reveal a gentle smile before Mu Chen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are Le’er and Pin’er. They’re identical twins. If they collaborate, even experts who had passed through their Spiritual Energy Disaster would not be able to escape from their hands,” said Wen Qingxuan as she point towards the two sweet and soul-stirring young girls that seemed to be cut out from the same mold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is Xiu Ling. Don’t look down on her. What she cultivates is a strength-based Deity Tier Spiritual Art. Furthermore, after cultivating a Body Refinement Deity Tier Spiritual Art, when she crossed hands with an expert who had passed his Spiritual Energy Disaster, she sent that fellow who tried to tease her was drilled straight into a mountain with a single punch… other than you and Luo Li, there’s no one in your group that is her match,” said Wen Qingxuan with a grin as she pointed to the golden-haired young girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden-haired young girl by the name of Xiu Ling nodded her head towards Mu Chen and Luo Li, before sending a faint and indifferent glance towards the embarassed-looking Xu Huang, Zhao Qingshan and Mu Fengyang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is An Ya. She’s a young wealthy woman, and god-knows how many Spiritual Items are carried by her. Wanting to defeat her isn’t something that's easy to accomplish,” said Wen Qingxuan as she pointed to the final quiet and refined-looking young girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Ya sent a somewhat embarrassed smile towards Mu Chen and his group, causing little dimples to appear on her lovable face, giving her an exceedingly pure look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In addition, they’re able to attempt their Spiritual Energy Disaster,” added Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this last point, Mu Chen could not help sighing in admiration, while nodding his head. That’s why Wen Qingxuan and her group was able to occupy and dominate the first place in the rankings. With such a lineup, the only words that could be used to describe them would be tyrannical. These girls appeared weak and frail, yet each and every one of them possessed strength comparable to those who have passed through their Spiritual Energy Disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Face against such a tyrannical group, if his group took action, Mu Chen felt that they wouldn't able to see the glimpse of victory; after all, their disparity in strength was rather clear. The only people in his group that could stand at the peak would be he and Luo Li. If their opponents were able to hold and obstruct the two of them, Xu Huang and the other two would quickly fall into a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, this was the main reason why Mu Chen had to give his all to contest the ancient remnant. As of now, they were representing the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, after all, and not fighting for themselves. Not only did he have to consider for himself, he also needed to take Xu Huang and the other two into consideration. If not, they would definitely be in quite a substantial disadvantage in the final match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about you?” asked Mu Chen with a smile towards Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the looks of it, Wen Qingxuan’s cultivation seemed to be of Spiritual Energy Disaster. However, Mu Chen could faintly discern some dangerous fluctuations coming from her. Clearly, she was concealing many things from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me?” A crafty smile appeared on Wen Qingxuan’s face as she replied, “ If you’re willing to share your secrets with me, I’ll consider doing so for mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What secrets do I have?” asked Mu Chen as he slightly narrowed his eyes.</span></p>

However, it seems to be in a state of deep sleep,” replied Wen Qingxuan with a faint smile as she cast her alluring and beautiful eyes towards Mu Chen.</span></p>

Nevermind. I’m also lying to you. Even if you tell me your secrets, I won’t be willing to tell you mine,” said Wen Qingxuan with a wave of her hand. Looking towards Luo Li, she said with a grin, “I’ll be willing if it’s Luo Li. Luo Li, do you want to know?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Luo Li only gave a faint smile, and shook her head before replying, “Everyone has their own secrets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did he tell his secrets to you?” asked Wen Qingxuan in a seemingly accidental fashion.</span></p>

Furthermore, I believe in him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen glared unhappily at Wen Qingxuan. For some reason, he could feel as if she was trying to incite disharmony between his relationship with Luo Li. However, their relationship was as stable as a cornerstone and not easily moved or shaken by such attempts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li, you truly are good at understanding people. I really like that.” Rays of splendor radiated from Wen Qingxuan’s phoenix-like eyes. Unable to control herself, she went near to Luo Li, before holding the latter’s slender hands in an intimate manner, while saying with an alluring laugh, “Why not toss away this bunch of smelly men and go together with us! We’ll definitely be able to become the champions of this Great Spiritual Academy Tournament!”</span></p>

However, the gaze Mu Chen sent towards Wen Qingxuan appeared somewhat weird and strange. Although Wen Qingxuan appeared like she was playing and teasing around, somehow, he felt that something was not quite right…</span></p>

However, while in at an angle that Luo Li was unable to see, she raised her eyebrows somewhat provocatively towards him before slightly opening her mouth.</span></p>
