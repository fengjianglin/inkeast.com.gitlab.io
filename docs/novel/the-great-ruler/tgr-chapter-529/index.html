The powerful pressure that was emitting from the Courtyard Spirit also withdrew.</span></p>

However, it did not land as it's empty eyes were focusing on Mu Chen. However, Mu Chen knew that it was looking at the ancient tree rune on his forehead.</span></p>

His body was still tense. The instant the Courtyard Spirit made any movements, he would immediately turn around and flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the situation that Mu Chen wished for not to happen did not take place. The Courtyard Spirit was suspended before him as it's empty eyes were flickering with light. Naturally, it no longer had any hostility towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the rear, Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan, who were about to move and help Mu Chen, also stopped their movements. They had naturally sensed that something wasn’t right as the Courtyard Spirit no longer attacked Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?” The two girls exchanged a glance and could see a hint of doubt in each other’s eyes.</span></p>

However, their tones were more to dark as they could vaguely feel that something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under those gazes, Mu Chen saw that the Courtyard Spirit no longer had any signs of attacking him and gradually relaxed his body. Thereafter, he saw the Courtyard Spirit slowly bow as its empty voice resounded, “Identity confirmed. The Successor has the qualifications to enter the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Successor? You’re talking about me?” Mu Chen asked as his heartbeat raced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You possess the Divine Tree Rune, that deems your identification as the Successor.” The Courtyard Spirit’s empty voice no longer had any enmity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So I’ll be able to enter the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard?” The corner of Mu Chen’s lips slightly twitched as he could not stop the surging excitement in his heart as he pointed towards the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Courtyard Spirit nodded its head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An uncontrollable excitement surged from Mu Chen’s pupils, which made him softly chuckle. The sudden change of events made him feel a little unreal. Originally, they should be forced to retreat. But, who could have imagined that he would suddenly become a Successor? Furthermore, possessing the qualification to enter the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s line-of-sight was directed towards Mo Yu and his group that was hiding within the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard in ridicule. The latter seemed to have sensed something as their faces turned pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan cautiously approached Mu Chen. The Courtyard Spirit did not react to their actions as it only quietly stood beside Mu Chen, seemingly like a loyal servant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, that white-haired Elder left me something which made this Courtyard Spirit address me as some Successor.” Mu Chen explained upon seeing the doubt in the eyes of the two girls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan was dumbfounded from his explanation. Thereafter, the latter gritted her teeth as she spoke, “Is this Divine Wood Palace founded by your house? Why does it seem that all the benefits goes to you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li was also nodded in agreement. Not long after Mu Chen entered the Divine Wood Palace, he had already obtained the most precious treasure of the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi. And now, he became some Successor. All these windfalls were something that could make others lament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen awkwardly rubbed his nose as he spoke, “This was something that I have obtained after risking my life. Earlier on, I was nearly killed by this Courtyard Spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since this Courtyard Spirit listens to you, can you get it to get those fellows out?” Wen Qingxuan pointed towards the Academy Alliance parties that hid themselves in the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard. Her expression was filled with enmity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he looked at Mo Yu’s group, who had a paled faces at this moment. “Seems like I’m the one that will be laughing till the end.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, what do you want?!” Mo Yu said in a stern voice. However, the paleness of his face was not as intimidating as his tone. He was panicking in his heart at this moment. Never, in his wildest imagination, could he expect that the Courtyard Spirit would suddenly listen to Mu Chen’s orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get out.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dream on!” Mo Yu furiously barked. Thereafter, he turned around and sent a palm out towards the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard. He wanted to obtain the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid quickly and leave this place with his men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puuuuufff!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yu’s figue flew backwards as a mouthful of blood spurt from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is this happening, didn’t we break the seal here?” Qin Feng and the rest exclaimed at the sight of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only the Successor can enter the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard. Anyone else that dares to intrude will be killed.” The Courtyard Spirit’s empty voice resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was startled at the scene of it. The things in the Divine Wood Palace were really uneasy to take. If he had not met that white-haired Elder from before, even if they had managed to somehow deal with Mo Yu and his group, it was also impossible for them to enter the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of this Courtyard Spirit was simply too powerful. To them, someone that possessed the strength of a Third Grade Spirit Disaster was extremely troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll give you guys two choices. Everyone get out or I’ll have the Courtyard Spirit do it.” Mu Chen chuckled as he looked at Mo Yu’s party and continued, “So, what is your choice?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of Mo Yu and his party changed. They wanted to reject with a sneer. However, they saw Mu Chen’s gaze gradually turn cold and instantly felt a chill in their hearts. Although there was some rules to this Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, if Mu Chen really wanted to act, he had quite a few means to force them to stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From their understanding towards Mu Chen, that fellow was not a lenient person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen, we’ll admit defeat here. How about this, we’ll split the things in the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard in half. Thereafter, you will be considered as a friend of our Academy Alliance. We would definitely help if there’s anything that you need of us.” Mo Yu said as his gaze flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he looked at them. He shook his head slowly yet firmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From his understanding towards a person like Mo Yu, he was someone that was greedy and ruthless. Even if they split the treasures equally now, Mo Yu would definitely bite him if he gets the chance to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have much time left to make the decision.” Mu Chen said in indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yu’s face turned extremely ugly as he glanced at Qin Feng and the group of people from the Academy Alliance. They were dispirited and did not have any intentions to carry on with the fight. He waved his hand in unwillingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing his gesture, all those that hid within the range of the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard charged out. They took a glance towards Mu Chen’s group of three in fear as they gathered at an area far from those three.</span></p>

Kill all of us here?” Mo Yu sneered. The Great Spiritual Academy Tournament had rules of its own. If they all died here, the Spiritual Academy that stood behind them would definitely not let this matter go. Generally speaking, there was some bottomline rules to the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, it forbade killing.</span></p>

He still remembered the words from the white-haired Elder. Every single one of the six Divine Wood Plaques contained a Lesser Divine Art. By combining the six Lesser Divine Arts, it would certainly turn into a powerful Divine Art, even within the records of the Divine Wood Palace.</span></p>

On the surface of his body, Spiritual Energy surged forth. Even Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan were looking at them with hostility.</span></p>

However, if that was the case, Mo Yu and his party would willingly risk it and go all-out. Naturally, the main thing was that Mu Chen realised that it was impossible to control it, even if he managed to obtain that Divine Wood Guard as the control rune on the Divine Wood Guard was extremely intact. It was incomparable to his broken goods.</span></p>
