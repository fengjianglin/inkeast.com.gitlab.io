 <p><strong>Chapter 327 - Using the Black Lightning</strong></p>
 <p>When Mu Chen closed his eyes again, everyone was instantly shocked. Even Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong violently contracted their eyes. From the looks of it, Mu Chen didn’t exhaust all of his abilities yet?</p>
 <p>He still had some hidden methods?</p>
 <p>At this time, Mu Chen, obviously, would not continue to arrange a Spiritual Array, as his speed was too slow. Furthermore, Gu Tianyan would not give him a second opportunity to do so. Therefore, he needed to utilise other methods.</p>
 <p>However, what methods would truly allow him, whose strength was at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase, to contend against Gu Tianyan?</p>
 <p>Nobody knew. Therefore, they could only lock their eyes tightly onto Mu Chen in the sky.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Gu Tianyan’s forehead had faintly wrinkled. Although he did not assume that Mu Chen was just putting up an act, after experiencing the Rank 5 Spiritual Arrays earlier, he would not see the latter as an ordinary Freshman again.</p>
 <p>However, as to exactly what method Mu Chen would use to contend against him, he appeared slightly curious. After all, common methods would definitely not be able to let a person of Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase to contend with an opponent of Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase.</p>
 <p>In the air, Mu Chen, whose eyes were tightly shut, did not make everyone wait for long. Lightning was faintly discernable around his body as it started to appear, while his skin started to turn a silvery colour, bit by bit.</p>
 <p>The peals of thunder quietly rang out.</p>
 <p>“Is that the Lightning God Physique?” upon seeing this, a trace of disappointment and doubt flashed past the eyes of Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong. They had also practiced the Lightning God Physique before. Although it was capable of increasing one’s combat prowess by quite a bit, it was far from being able to substitute the disparity of Mu Chen from Gu Tianyan.</p>
 <p>If Mu Chen tried to use this to contend against Gu Tianyan, the result was already clearly evident.</p>
 <p>In the sky, Mu Chen’s eyes slowly opened as lightning sparkled within them. Lightning arcs danced and jumped around his body as a destructive power was faintly discernible as it radiated out.</p>
 <p>“His strength has grown.”</p>
 <p>Gu Tianyan’s eyes faintly narrowed as disappoint flashed within them as he thought, <em>This is far from enough…</em></p>
 <p>The ones who felt this wasn't only them. Even the participating students in the surroundings of the Spiritual Light Mountain faintly wrinkled their foreheads as some worry surfaced within their eyes. Although Mu Chen’s aura had grown stronger, it was clearly far from being able to contend with Gu Tianyan.</p>
 <p>However, facing those gazes that blotted to sky, Mu Chen did not care to bother much about them, with his gaze only having Gu Tianyan present within. In the next instant, he took a step forward. With his body transforming into a bolt of lightning, he shot forward.</p>
 <p>Gu Tianyan did not have the slightest trace of movement as he looked at Mu Chen, who was hurtling over akin to a bolt of lightning. Gently shaking his head, he thought, <em>Is Mu Chen trying to shatter the broken jar? However, for him to just rush over like this…</em></p>
 <p>Giving a helpless smile, he did not continue to think about it. With a twist of his palm, scarlet-red Spiritual Energy rose out, akin to dancing flames, as boundless fluctuations started to radiate out.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s speed was exceedingly quick. Within a number of breaths, he had seemingly appeared before Gu Tianyan. Without the slightest trace of hesitation, he immediately sent a fist rumbling out.</p>
 <p>Spiritual Energy burning with black flames gushed out while bringing along strong fluctuations. This caused even the ground to crack under the force of his full-force attack.</p>
 <p>The violent fist of winds caused Gu Tianyan’s hair to shock and flutter. However, the latter only shook his head gently. Clenching his finger tightly, in the next instant, Gu Tianyan similarly sent a fist rumbling out.</p>
 <p>“Sigh.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the fists that were about to smash together in a moment, a low sigh rang out in the hearts of everyone watching. There were even some people who had turned their heads away. In such a head-on confrontation, Mu Chen simply didn’t have the slightest chance of victory.</p>
 <p>Wang Tong and the rest laughed bitterly, before shaking their heads and sighing.</p>
 <p>Su Linger’s lovable face turned pale at the moment. Only Luo Li, standing beside her, still had clear eyes, while tightly staring at Mu Chen, because she knew him too well…</p>
 <p>Regardless of how difficult the situation was, he would never do an action that was absolutely pointless.</p>
 <p>Under the unblinking gazes of countless people, Mu Chen’s and Gu Tianyan’s fists were about to collide. However, just at this instant, the other hand of Mu Chen quickly formed a mysterious symbol.</p>
 <p>Humm! Humm!</p>
 <p>Following the completion of that symbol, astonishing sounds of lightning furiously rang out from within his body. In the meridians of a part of his body, an uneven black lightning bead furiously exploded at this instant.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At the instant when the black lightning bead exploded, an indescribably terrifying force gushed out from within, akin to a flood. Black-coloured lightning liquid overflowed, circulating erratically along his meridians.</p>
 <p>Intense pain spread out from within Mu Chen’s body, causing his eyes to turn bloodshot as the capillaries in his eyes bulged out. Despite this, he firmly resisted the pain and hurriedly displayed the Lightning God Physique, frantically absorbing the terrifying power of lightning.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At this same instant, the fists of Mu Chen and Gu Tianyan violent collided into each other!</p>
 <p>Black-coloured lightning suddenly gushed out from every pore of Mu Chen’s body, while a faint bloody mist was even discernable.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>An astonishingly loud sound that shook the heavens and earth rang out and resonated across this stretch of the world. A violent tremor seemingly ran through the giant peak that seemed to prop the sky up, while everyone could see that the earth there had collapsed, as giant cracks endlessly extended from there like black pythons.</p>
 <p>Waves of shattered rock shot out from the origin of impact, hiding the skies and covering the earth as they shot out in all directions, before transforming into fragments that blotted the skies with a bang.</p>
 <p>Everyone opened their eyes wide as they stared at the place where shattered rocks continued to shoot out. The place was enveloped by the dazzling rays of erratic Spiritual Energy, causing people to be unable to exactly see what had happened within.</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, as well as Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan, locked their gazes there with graveness showing in their eyes.</p>
 <p>At the instant when their gazes had locked onto the origin of impact, the pupils of the four violently contracted as an erratic roar of thunder furiously resounded. In the next instant, a shadow had, unexpectedly, shot out from the place of dazzling radiance.</p>
 <p>The two feet of the figure dug into the ground, creating two foot holes in the hard stone surface, before dragging back, forming two eye-piercing marks, approximately a hundred metres long. Scorched marks were presented on the rocks along the sides of those marks.</p>
 <p>Exactly who was that?!</p>
 <p>Everyone’s gazes instantly converged over where the figure that was shot out staggered and stumbled, before stabilising his footing. As the radiance dissipated, bit by bit, it finally revealed a conspicuous head of scarlet-red hair</p>
 <p>That was Gu Tianyan!</p>
 <p>The pupils of countless people violently expanded, with some even forgetting to breath as thick shock and incredulous expressions crept onto their faces.</p>
 <p>“How is that possible…?”</p>
 <p>Regardless if the surroundings were the Spiritual Light Mountain or the northern public square, everyone was mumbling in disbelief. The person that was miserably flung out was, unexpectedly, Gu Tianyan?</p>
 <p>On the podium, the gazes of the Elders watching the fight started to turn dignified at this moment.</p>
 <p>“What’s happening…?”</p>
 <p>The four, Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan, looked in astonishment at the spectacle that made people feel incredulous. Even the four of them were slightly able to regain their clarity.</p>
 <p>Previously, the two Rank 5 Spiritual Arrays were unable to force Gu Tianyan to such a miserable state. However, could this kind of head-on confrontation that should not have the slightest chance of victory, lead to such a result?</p>
 <p>Under the shocked gazes that blotted the sky, Gu Tianyan slowly raised his head. At this moment, an obvious trace of blood dripped down from the corner of his mouth as he looked towards the direction of the giant peak with a similar shock in his eyes. From there, an erratic Spiritual Energy was still enveloping the place.</p>
 <p>“You’re truly formidable. I never imagined that you’re actually still hiding an ace that’s even more formidable that the two Rank 5 Spiritual Arrays…” Gu Tianyan’s hoarse and deep voice rang out as he wiped away the blood stains at the corner of his mouth, while no longer appearing to be as relaxed as before.</p>
 <p>Within the centre of the radiance where the erratic Spiritual Energy was still present, footsteps seemed to be ringing out as everyone’s gazes tightly locked onto that area.</p>
 <p>Thump! Thump!</p>
 <p>The sounds of footsteps become increasingly heavy, within the Spiritual Energy radiance, a figure became increasingly clear. In the next moment, he stepped out of the dazzling radiance, and appeared before all of the gazes.</p>
 <p>Hiss!</p>
 <p>When that figure appeared, everyone instantly sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>The Mu Chen that had appeared before them had a huge change from his previous appearance. Shattered lines had appeared on his body as black-coloured lightning liquid endlessly flowed from the pores of his body, before enveloping him within.</p>
 <p>Black-coloured lightning danced across his body, while the pair of black pupils were filled with an indescribable savageness that seemed to be the flavor of destruction.</p>
 <p>If the previous Mu Chen gave people a gentle and calm feeling, the current him was akin to the creature that had crawl out of the depths to destroy the heavens and earth, causing people’s hearts to palpitate.</p>
 <p>“What is that…?”</p>
 <p>Everyone looked in shock at the changed Mu Chen. The destructive energies radiating from him, was that truly something that could be displayed by a person at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase?</p>
 <p>“That’s the Lightning God Physique?” muttered Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong as their eyes were brimming with doubt. They were able to detect the familiar fluctuations from Mu Chen’s body. However, this familiar Lightning God Physique was much stronger than the Lightning God Physique they knew…</p>
 <p>Within the northern public square, countless people were still in shock, while the faces of the Elders at the podium turned grave and dignified.</p>
 <p>“This fluctuation…”</p>
 <p>The abstruse eyes of Dean Tai Cang faintly contracted, before saying in a soft voice, “This is the might of the Divine Black Lightning. Unexpectedly, there’s a strand of Divine Black Lightning in that brat’s body.”</p>
 <p>“He truly is messing around.” said a white-haired Elder on the side as he shook his head, before continuing, “Although I don’t know where he got that Divine Black Lightning from, its the stuff that even people of Sovereign Rank would not dare to casually touch. However, that kid actually dared to keep it within his body…”</p>
 <p>“Haha, that Physique Cultivating Deity Tier Spiritual Art sure looks familiar.”</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang gave a faint smile without saying anything else. However, the gaze that locked onto the figure of the youth in the light screen radiated with increasing interest.</p>
 <p><em>Looks like our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy has produced another brat with a monstrous talent.</em></p>
 <p>On the giant peak, under the attentive gazes of countless people, Mu Chen slowly raised his head. With black-coloured lightning liquid flowing around him, he tightly stared at Gu Tianyan. At this moment, a hoarse voice, along with the flavor of destruction, slowly rang out.</p>
 <p>“Let’s continue.”</p>
 <p>As the hoarse voice rang out, Mu Chen took a step forward, with the earth seemingly vibrating at this instant.</p>
