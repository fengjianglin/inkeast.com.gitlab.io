That area was a small-scaled transaction stage. Generally speaking, those who were able to come here to do trades all possessed decent amounts of power.</span></p>

The scroll was in a sword shape as it was filled with traces of time. At the same time, the peculiar ripple that was being emitted from the scroll was startling.</span></p>

The ripple that was being emitted from the bronze scroll was the reason why he halted his steps and turned around. After all, he had another identity, a Spiritual Array Master. Therefore, his interest was piqued by the Spiritual Array Diagram.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan took a glance at Mu Chen and fell into her thoughts.</span></p>

The scroll in my hand is indeed, a Spiritual Array Diagram.” At this moment, that youth raised the scroll in his hand as his robust voice resounded, “This Spiritual Array Diagram should be a Rank 5 Spiritual Array. However, this is a Combination Diagram.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Combination Diagram?”</span></p>

Many of those that were interested in it slightly focused their attention as they directed their gazes towards the scroll in the youth’s hand.</span></p>

Once one reaches the level of Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master, they would be unpredictable. One further step and they would become Spiritual Array Grandmaster. Generally speaking, Spiritual Array Grandmasters were existences that could compete with Sovereign Realm experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Henceforth, there were huge differences between the weaker and stronger Rank 5 Spiritual Array Masters. Few powerful Rank 5 Spiritual Array Masters could even cause fear for experts that had already went through their Spiritual Energy Disaster or even Spirit Disaster. At the same time, there were also some Rank 5 Spiritual Array Masters that could have trouble dealing with an expert that had already gone through their Human Body Disaster.</span></p>

The main difference would be depended on the insight one had towards Spiritual Arrays, the second Spiritual Array Diagram.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When some powerful Rank 5 Spiritual Array Diagram falls into the hands of a powerful Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master, the power unleashed would be extremely fearsome.</span></p>

Naturally, once such Diagrams were successfully laid out, the might would also be astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it is a Combination Diagram.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen muttered to himself as his black pupils lit up. As expected, his interest had already been lured by the Combination Diagram.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he had entered into the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, he had not revealed his Spiritual Array Master identity. It was not that he did not wish to use Spiritual Arrays, it was because there wasn’t any suitable Spiritual Array Diagram for him. After all, the opponents that he encountered at his level were all those that were already in the Three Sovereign Disasters. Although the Spiritual Arrays that he had cultivated in the past were not too weak, he was also not able to fully display their full potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Let's take the Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array as an example. With his current accomplishment in the Spiritual Array field, he had fully studied the Spiritual Array Diagram. That Spiritual Array Diagram could also be considered as a Combination Diagram. It's complete form should be four lotuses. However, with his current strength, he could only unleash it at two lotuses. The Three Lotus-Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array was too powerful and it would require him to be at the level of Spiritual Array Grandmaster in order to execute it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the current him required a Spiritual Array that he could fully unleash it's potential. Without a doubt, this Rank 5 Combination Diagram was perfect for the current Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, such a Combination Diagram was not easy to find. However, his luck had allowed him to encounter one before his eyes at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere around the transaction stage was heated up at this moment. One could tell that there was quite a group of people that were interested in it. From their reactions, one could tell that those groups had Spiritual Array Masters in their team. However, once they communicated with the Spiritual Array Masters in their team, quite a number of them had disappointment in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the Spiritual Array Masters in their teams had told them that the Rank 5 Combination Diagram was too complicated for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The name of this Spiritual Array Diagram is called Lesser Thousand Spiritual Spiritual Array. I suppose everyone knows the power of a Combination Diagram at this level. This was found by me in a ruin. I would suggest those Spiritual Array Masters that are not powerful enough to give up on it.” The youth smiled as he continued to hold onto the bronze scroll.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words caused much disdain. However, no one retorted him as they all knew that the might of such a Combination Spiritual Array could rival a Rank 6 Spiritual Array of Sovereign Realm experts. Although such a Spiritual Array was extremely complicated, the strength was excellent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m auctioning this Spiritual Array Diagram in this transaction stage. All I’m asking for is 2500 points.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he finished his speech, it attracted a second wave of uproar to the point that even Mu Chen had his brows slightly frowned. Such a price was not low at this point for them. After all, they only possessed 3700 points, whereas the price of it was 2500. It was impossible for ordinary teams to afford such a price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone started talking amongst themselves around the transaction stage, with many people shaking their heads inwardly and gave up on it. Although the Spiritual Array Diagram was powerful, the requirement was too demanding. Even if they had managed to obtain it, it was also hard for them to successfully execute it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen pondered for a brief moment before looking at his team. He really was tempted by it. However, the points belonged to the team, so he could not spend it alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have no objections,” Luo Li smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are the Captain, you make the decision.” Xu Huang and the other two said as they smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks.” Mu Chen nodded his head. He no longer hesitated and declared, “2600.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice broke the discussion of others as many startled gazes were directed at him. After they had taken a good look at Mu Chen, they started to discuss again.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From their Academy Emblem, it should be the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy? Could it be the team of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy that had managed to enter the Top 16?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should be them. Otherwise, how could they afford to many points?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the discussions, many people understood the identity of Mu Chen’s team and their gazes turned a little more heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth that was on the transaction stage threw an astonished gaze as he shouted out loud, “The team from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy bids 2600 points. Is there any higher bids?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no responses to his question. Many teams could only shrug their shoulders in helplessness. The price was already very high, not to mention that they did not have the capability to lay out such a complicated Spiritual Array. Therefore, there was no need to exchange such an item with the points that they had gathered with so much effort.</span></p>

Looks like his intention to earn a big sum had fallen. However, at least he had gotten a high price for it.</span></p>

On the second level of the building, there were some shadows standing in the darkness. Standing at the front, there were two people leaning against the pillar. They were smiling as they looked at Mu Chen and his group.</span></p>

He had a charming appearance with a smile hanging on his lips. Sharpness was being emitted from his pair of eyes. On the right, it was a robust man whose figure was comparable to a bear. His bare arms were filled with scars, emitting dense bloodlust.</span></p>

When their gazes met, there was a chill in their circulating between their gazes.</span></p>

They could not help twitching their brows. Those two fellows actually showed themselves. Furthermore, it seems they were aiming at the team from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy… Looks like there’s a show for them to watch. This team from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy wasn't your ordinary group. Likewise, those two weren’t ordinary as well. Recently, there were many powerful teams that fell by their hands.</span></p>

Clearly, the two of them were very powerful. However, he had never seen them before nor is there any Academy Emblem on them…</span></p>

It appears that the two of them are coming for you.” Wen Qingxuan’s jade-like fingers fiddled with her hair as she removed the doubt for Mu Chen.</span></p>
