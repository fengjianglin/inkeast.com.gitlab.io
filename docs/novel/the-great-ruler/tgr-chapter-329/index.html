 <p><strong>Chapter 329 - Victory</strong></p>
 <p>The skies turned dark and overcast, while every single gaze in the surroundings of the Spiritual Light Mountain was focused on the air above the giant peak. There were two frightening attacks that caused everyone to shudder and tremble. They howled, before violently colliding like two comets that streaked across the skies.</p>
 <p>In that instant, an intense shock wave rang and resounded across the entire hunting grounds.</p>
 <p>The dazzlingly intense light produced was akin to a scorching sun, sending its intense rays of light that shattered the darkness of the world. Under the eye-piercing light, the eyes of countless people could not help turning narrow.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>As the intense sun surfaced in the sky, the dragon, tiger and tortoise released all of the strongest energies contained within them without the slightest bit of restraint. This caused an approximate thousand metre wide Spiritual Energy storm to form, and faint traces of distortions could be faintly discernable in the surrounding space.</p>
 <p>Everyone tightly stared at the incomparably large Spiritual Energy storm. As the Spiritual Energy within it grew increasingly erratic, the storm started to distort, traces of it being unable to contain the energy within it any longer.</p>
 <p>Creak!</p>
 <p>As the distortions present within the Spiritual Energy storm reached its limit, before the crowd could react, it exploded, causing thousand metre wide Spiritual Energy ripples to sweep across the skies.</p>
 <p>That was a rather spectacular scene.</p>
 <p>Being at the front most position against the shock waves, Mu Chen and Gu Tianyan both bore the greatest brunt of it. Although the two of them had done their utmost to defend against them, they were still sent flying the instant they made contact with them.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>As the bodies of the two flew out, the neighbouring mountain peaks were all smashed through by them.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Finally, the two of them smashed straight into the inside of the two mountain peaks. Rocks rolled down, covering and burying the both of them up. While both of them had miserable outcomes, the people close to the giant peak were akin to small fishes stuck in churning waters as each of them was sent tumbling into a pitiful state. There were some that were even more unlucky, being sent twisting in the air while spurting out blood from their mouths.</p>
 <p>However, it was fortunate that this was, after all, just the aftermath of the collision, with not much destruction being caused. After a few minutes, the devastating Spiritual Energy storm started to slowly get weaker, bit by bit.</p>
 <p>Only when that happened did the surrounding crowd start to regain their senses, and turned their gazes towards the giant peak. Unable to bear it, their mouths started to twitch. As of now, the lowering giant peak was in a completely ruined state, with giant cracks extending from it, akin to a spider web, covering it entirely.</p>
 <p>The collision between the two had seemingly destroyed the entire towering giant peak.</p>
 <p>This caused quite a few people to feel shock and astonishment within their hearts. The destructive power of these two people was too terrifying…</p>
 <p>“What about the two of them…?”</p>
 <p>Someone thought about the two main characters, before hurriedly turning their gazes towards the two collapsed mountain peaks in the distance. Those students that participated in the hunt were, as of now, incomparably nervous and anxious. Mu Chen’s victory or defeat concerned all of them being able to acquire the Spiritual Light Empowerment. As of now, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had yet to make their move, as even they were waiting, waiting for Mu Chen to give some closure for them…</p>
 <p>As long as Mu Chen was able to finish his fight with a draw, all of the students there would basically achieve a definite victory in the combined results. However, if Mu Chen lost, they would need to win a fight amongst the last two. Furthermore, thinking about the need for them to defy the heavens to pull off a reversal, this would be an extremely difficult task to accomplish for even Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>After all, both Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan, who had yet to make a move, weren’t people that were easy to deal with.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the expressions on Shen Cangsheng’s and Li Xuantong’s faces turned increasingly grave and solemn. Locking their sights on the two collapsed mountain peaks, even with their strong emotional control, their hearts started to beat faster.</p>
 <p>Contrary to them, Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan remained more calm and collected. However, their tight and unwavering gazes reveal their concern for the result.</p>
 <p>The entire stretch of the world turned quiet again, while everyone awaited the result. However, the pressure coming from the surroundings was extremely fierce, causing people to be unable catch their breath.</p>
 <p>This atmosphere was similarly present in the northern square, since everyone was staring tightly at the gigantic light screen in the sky, while tightly clenching their hands. The previous fight had admittedly caused them to feel shock, as well as sighing in admiration. However, regardless of that, the result was the most important.</p>
 <p>Crash! Boom!</p>
 <p>Under the attentive gazes of countless people, rocks started to suddenly shift and roll down from one of the collapsed mountain peaks, causing everyone’s gazes to hurriedly turn over. Over there, a scarlet-red Spiritual Energy rushed to the skies, before a figure rushed out from within the collapsed mountain peak.</p>
 <p>“That’s Gu Tianyan!” someone exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The scarlet-red light slowly dissipated, revealing Gu Tianyan. As of now, his entire body was covered in blood, with his face appearing exceedingly pale. The Spiritual Energy surrounding his body appeared extremely weak and exhausted, without being as strong as his initial appearance.</p>
 <p>Obviously, the previously astonishing clash was not something light for Gu Tianyan.</p>
 <p>Upon noticing the reappearance of Gu Tianyan, the hearts of countless students could not help sinking. Although he had suffered serious injuries, he was still not at the stage where he was unable to continue the fight…</p>
 <p>As for Mu Chen…</p>
 <p>Looking at the other collapsed mountain peak that was showing no signs of activity, their palms were all filled with sweat.</p>
 <p>This kind of silence, continued for a short moment.</p>
 <p>Creak!</p>
 <p>At the other collapsed mountain peak, the rocks started to shift and roll down. Everyone’s eyes turned large when they noticed a weak black ray of Spiritual Energy rushing out from within the layer of rocks that were pushed apart.</p>
 <p>Within the black Spiritual Energy, a figure stumble and staggered as he shot through the air, before stopping a short distance away.</p>
 <p>It was Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>However, as of now, he was entirely covered in blood, with rather serious and terrible-looking wounds on his body. Compared to Gu Tianyan, he obviously appeared more miserable and pitiful.</p>
 <p>However, even though he had suffered such serious injuries, he still stood perfectly straight in the air. As of now, the youthful figure appeared exceedingly thin. As his tattered clothing fluttered in the wind, his miserable-looking appearance was unexpectedly unable to conceal the imposing aura that made people’s hearts palpitate.</p>
 <p>Due to his injuries, the eyes of the youth had appeared dark and dim. Staring fiercely at Gu Tianyan in the distance, they appeared akin to a ferocious gaze of a wolf or a tiger.</p>
 <p>Countless gazes blankly stared at the youth that still stood up on the sky, covered in fresh blood. The silence continued for a long moment, before it was broken by the earth-shattering cheers.</p>
 <p>Facing Gu Tianyan’s strongest attack, Mu Chen had managed to successfully endure it!</p>
 <p>He did not collapse!</p>
 <p>Countless students were emotional to the point that their faces were turning red as they waved their hands in the air. Their gazes looking at the thin figure in the sky were filled with admiration and worship. These kinds of gazes had already resembled those that were used when they looked at Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, and no one else.</p>
 <p>“Too awesome…”</p>
 <p>The faces of the three Wang Brothers had also turned red, and their expressions were filled with emotions. As of now, their eyes were filled with respect. Mu Chen’s performance in this fight had completely won them over.</p>
 <p>Naturally, they knew that the people being conquered would be many of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy students. From this day onwards, Mu Chen’s place within the academy might not be much weaker than Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>Even influential characters like Su Xuan and He Yao had already been tossed far, far away by Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Su Ling’er had also started to cheer, with her lovable face turning red, while emotionally grabbing onto Su Xuan’s wrist. Previously, she had almost suffocated, while watching the fight. If Mu Chen had lost in the final exchange, she would have simply lost her life.</p>
 <p>Su Xuan gently nodded her small head as she looked at Mu Chen’s figure with a gentle smile on her face. Who would have thought that a few months ago, this Freshman was still an unknown person within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy? However, now…</p>
 <p>Perhaps he would become the fastest improving Freshman in the history of the Northern Heaven Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Contrary to everyone, Luo Li did not show the same level of emotions as the others. Staring quietly at Mu Chen, a faint upwardly-curling arc appeared at the corners of her small red lips. She had always believed that the youth that she loved would be someone that became as dazzling as the stars.</p>
 <p>Regardless of before, or now, or even in the future…</p>
 <p>““Hu~.””</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong both exhaled a quiet breath of relief as they looked at Mu Chen’s figure. Unable to help it, they nodded their heads as they thought, <em>That fellow truly makes people have a whole new level of respect for him.</em></p>
 <p>In the sky, Gu Tianyan had also looked with complicated emotions at the battered and exhausted youth, whose eyes were still shining exceedingly bright. Hearing the deafening sounds of cheering coming from the surroundings, he could not help letting out a bitter laugh. When he was still a student, there were a lot of people then that had cheered for him in the same manner. However, as of now, the positions were reversed…</p>
 <p>“Senior Brother Gu, did you have a great fight? If you feel that it's not enough, I might be able to accompany you for a move or two more.” From a distance, Mu Chen slowly wiped away the bloodstains at the corners of his mouth as he spoke out, while a smile that was hard to raise appeared on his mouth.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, Gu Tianyan made a laugh, before slowly relaxing his body. Gesturing with his hand, he said, “It’s alright. If I continue to say anything more, I’m afraid I’ll invoke the anger of the crowd. Furthermore, I said earlier that if you’re able to receive that move of mine, you’ll be the victor of this fight.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Gu Tianyan’s gaze turned serious as he stared at Mu Chen. Cupping his hands, a low and deep voice slowly rang throughout the sky.</p>
 <p>“I’ve lost this fight.”</p>
 <p>His actions had shown that he had already placed Mu Chen on equal grounds to himself. As of now, to him, the latter was no longer just a Freshman of Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase.</p>
 <p>“Thanks for going easy, Senior Brother Gu.”</p>
 <p>Without being unreasonable, Mu Chen gently nodded his head. He had risked his life for this fight. But, it was all worth it.</p>
 <p>Following his words, the cheering voices in the surroundings instantly rose another notch as countless people became so emotional that their faces turned red.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen won!”</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen won!”</p>
 <p>As countless sounds of cheering resounded, even the students at the northern square, who had not participated in the hunt were feeling abnormally emotional. This fight was sufficient to make their hot blood boil.</p>
 <p>On the podium, a few elders had also faintly nodded their heads. Obviously, they felt extremely satisfied by the fight that had just occurred.</p>
 <p>“Dean, looks like our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy has another new monstrous talent. Congratulations…” said a white-haired old man sitting beside Dean Tai Cang.</p>
 <p>As of now, there was also a faint smile present on Dean Tai Cang’s face as he looked at the youth in the light screen, before slowly replying, “For the sake of that Ji Xuan, Saint Spiritually Academy had not hesitated to use those underhanded moves. However, I have to tell them that our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Mu Chen isn’t any weaker than him…”</p>
 <p>While deafening cheering sounds resounded around them, on the giant peaks, both Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had smiled and laughed. In the next moment, they turned around, looking at Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan, who had slightly complicated expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Senior, the next fights, should be our turn now…”</p>
