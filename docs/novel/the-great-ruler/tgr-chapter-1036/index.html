The lustre that they had emitted wasn’t powerful, but those around them paled in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the three lumps of light, there was an axe, a ruler and a mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The axe was bronze in colour, covered with mottled traces as if it had once split open the sky with boundless might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ruler was pitch-black without any other colours mixed in it. It looked like it could devour any light in the heavens and earth if it was waved down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mirror was an extremely antique-looking mirror with a rough surface, looking quite ordinary. It was even emitting a primal and ancient aura and a sense of mystery emitted from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single one of those items was evidently powerful. The fluctuations that they emitted had far exceeded the domains of Peerless Rank Divine Artifacts and had stepped into the realm of Quasi-Saint Artifacts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those were treasures that Mu Chen dreamt of possessing. If he could obtain even one, then his fighting strength would greatly increase. He could even slaughter Jin Qingtian quite easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts with blazing eyes and licked his lips. Greed surged in his heart once more. When facing the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts that he could easily obtain with a grasp of his hand, not even Earth Sovereigns might be able to calm their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze grew hotter as he took another step forth. Spiritual Energy had turned into a huge hand that tore through space and immediately made a grab for the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts. Since they’re just right before him, then he wouldn’t let a single one of them escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the massive hand of Spiritual Energy streaked through the horizon, it had easily entered the current of Divine Artifacts, and appeared before the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts, wanting to grab them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hand streaked across the sky, but just when Mu Chen was about to come in contact with the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts, his eyes suddenly flashed and he restored his clarity before biting his tongue and a mouthful of blood gushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The traces of blood hung on the corner of Mu Chen’s lips and even the hand of Spiritual Energy had froze without touching the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts that quietly floated before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth and his complexion was somewhat ugly. Earlier, when he wanted to grab the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts, his cautious and tough character that he had trained over the years had finally shown its effect, forcefully controlling the dense greed in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the greed disappeared, Mu Chen had restored his clarity and started to feel that something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because everything was way too smooth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he was going to seize the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts, there wasn’t the slightest obstruction. Although the Treasure Beast had already died, Mu Chen did not believe that such an existence did not leave any means behind to protect the treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumour had it that the Treasure Beasts were extremely stringy with their treasures. So if he thought that he could take the treasures without any worries, then he might suffer the consequences of his own actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, after entering this space, Mu Chen felt that it was extremely easy for greed to nurture in his heart. It wasn’t something that he had intended but was affected by some means that had been left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those means might’ve been left by the Treasure Beast and if he really did as he wished, and seize the treasures, then all his efforts might’ve been wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood in the sky as he pondered. After a brief moment, he took in a deep breath before sitting down and gradually shut his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not attempt to seize the treasures again. He had intended to calm his heart and discard the temptation of greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Mu Chen closed his eyes and sat down, his mind gradually calmed down. The greed that flashed between his brows had also slowly faded away. His heart was as calm as the surface of the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time quietly flowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Mu Chen opened his eyes and his black pupils were reflected with tranquillity. Like a deep pool without any fluctuation and the greed from before had also completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the current of Divine Artifacts once again with a calm mind. But this time, what he saw was different from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling current had slowly disappeared, as if it was all an illusion. Mu Chen quietly watched the current of Divine Artifacts disappear without feeling any pity until the current had completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the current disappeared, only the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts still remained in this space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at them without any action. There weren’t any ripples in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silence lasted for a long time before the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts finally moved. Light blossomed from them and the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts slowly moved closer to one another before they combine together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw this scene, a ripple finally appeared in his eyes. The three Quasi-Saint Artifacts from before weren’t illusions, they had truly existed. But because of his choice, it had caused the trick left behind by the Treasure Beast to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also extremely curious in his heart regarding these changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts combined together, light distorted before it gradually faded and an item appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t an axe, ruler or mirror. But a palm-sized black ball. Upon taking a closer look at it, one would realise that the ball was somewhat similar to a black eyeball…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black eyeball hovered in the air, vaguely emitting a sense of mystery that would make the heart of others turn cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the black eyeball appeared, it had slowly drifted over and stopped before Mu Chen. He briefly hesitated before stretching his hand out and grabbed ahold of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold sensation spread out from his palm before Mu Chen flicked his finger and a droplet of his blood essence landed on it. The blood essence swiftly dissolved into the black eyeball. Thereafter, he could feel the connection with this item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The treasures here were practically without an owner after the Treasure Beast had died. As long as he could obtain it, then he would be able to bind it to him through his blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he formed a connection with it, Mu Chen immediately felt some ancient information pouring towards his mind that seemed to be describing the origin of this item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen felt the information with his eyes closed before opening them a brief moment later. Curiosity filled in his eyes as he looked at the black eyeball. This item was called the Life-Extinguishing Pupil, which was said to be made with the eyeball of the Treasure Beast as the base material, with some powerful treasures added inside. Looking at another angle, it could be considered the lifeline treasure of the Treasure Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for the Treasure Beast dying prematurely, the Treasure Beast would have definitely refined it into a genuine Saint Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even so, the Life-Extinguishing Pupil was also the strongest Quasi-Saint Artifact that the Treasure Beast had refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s the case…”</span></p>

If he had previously tried to obtain the three Quasi-Saint Artifacts, then he would be left with nothing now.</span></p>

If one wanted to see the Life-Extinguishing Pupil, then they would have to forsake all greed.

Although the Life-Extinguishing Pupil was only a Quasi-Saint Artifact, the might far exceed ordinary Quasi-Saint Artifacts. If he had enough luck, he might even be able to evolve it into a genuine Saint Artifact.</span></p>

Thereafter, a black light gathered on his forehead as vertical pitch-black eye slowly opened. Blacklight

Mu Chen immediately discovered that the scene before him had greatly changed. He had quickly looked through space and saw the massive Treasure Lake.</span>

Evidently, it was left by the impact of the Treasure Beast when it fell. Sweeping his gaze out, his heart raced.</span></p>
