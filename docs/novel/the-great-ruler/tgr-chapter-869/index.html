Mu Chen solemnly looked in the direction of that disappeared figure and cupped his fists.</span></p>

It made him feel a little uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five Kings had flown over, then one of them lightly said with doubt in their eyes, “Four Spiritual Battle Formation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There must be a genuine battle formation up ahead.” Mu Chen nodded with a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the two words “Battle Formation”, the eyes of the Kings flashed with a smear of fear. That’s because they were clear that the battle formation set up by a Battle Formation Master would definitely be extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ordinary Spiritual Array Masters could borrow the power of the heavens and earth through arrays, whereas Battle Formation Masters had formed arrays with their endless troops. That sort of boundless Battle Will was something that even the heavens and earth feared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they had gathered nearly half of Great Havenlaw Domain’s forces, they would also feel extremely fearful of a battle formation set up by a Battle Formation Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They felt fearful, but they had no intentions of retreating. They had already made it this far, so if they were to retreat now, it would be an utter embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let us first refine the Fallen Origin Pellets.” Mu Chen retracted his gaze as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Kings heard Mu Chen’s words, their minds trembled before directing their attention at the boundless Fallen Origin Aura that was spreading out from what was left behind after cleansing that zombie troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far away, the other forces that were rushing here had seen the boundless Fallen Origin Aura as well, all of their eyes were red from greed. However, they were fearful of Mu Chen’s party’s luxurious formation and could only retract the greed in their hearts. After all, aside from the six Kings, there were also five troops eyeing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they could only watch as Mu Chen and the Kings move out to refine the Fallen Origin Aura into pellets, with an amount that reached nearly ten thousand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a harvest could be comparable to a Grade-2 Ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the last strand of Fallen Origin Aura was refined into Fallen Origin Pellets, only then did the Kings stop with satisfaction. This time, they had refined over nine thousand Fallen Origin Pellets. After they were distributed, each of them had obtained nearly two thousand, which was a significant harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Death Ruin is indeed a Grade-1 Ruin.” The Mountain Splitting King sighed. It was only a troop and they had refined nearly ten thousand Fallen Origin Pellets. If it was compared to Grade-3 Ruins, they would probably have to find 30 Grade-3 Ruins to match that harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, despite the ample harvest, it was also exceptionally dangerous. If it wasn’t for their luxurious formation, their outcome wouldn’t have been any better than the Martial Pole Sect’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Kings looked at Mu Chen with seeking intentions. Before the Fifth Commander disappeared earlier, he had mentioned a terrifying battle formation deep within this ruin. Especially the ‘liege’ mentioned by the Fifth Commander, which should be the Sky Formation Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps there might’ve been lots of treasures awaiting them, but the dangers harboured within were also extremely stunning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let us go take a look first. If it’s too powerful, then we’ll leave after harvesting some Fallen Origin Pellets.” Mu Chen sunk into silence for a brief moment, before speaking decisively. Although any information regarding a Battle Formation Master was extremely important to him, he couldn’t afford to let the Kings suffer a loss because of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the five Kings heard his words, they nodded their heads without any objections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen cast a glance towards the depths of the ruin. Those spectators that were watching their battle with the zombie troop had also dispersed and there weren’t any fools that tried to rob them. Without any hesitation, he waved his hands and turned into a streak of light that flew towards the depths of the ruin, with the alliance following closely behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their journey wasn’t calm. There were multiple zombie troops that endlessly poured out of the darkness and had heavily hindered their steps. However, as they didn’t have any better routes, they could only forcefully make their way in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After breaking the heavy layers of obstructions, they had also started to suffer casualties, despite their luxurious formation. If it weren’t for the Kings providing aid in time, they would have suffered even more serious casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even if the obstructions were powerful, they were slowly moving deeper and closer to the depths of the ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they got closer to the depths, they could see several miserable groups. They were all from elite forces in the Northern Region, without any lacking of Sixth Grade Sovereign experts overseeing the group. But even so, they were swallowed up by the tidal waves of zombie troops. Some who were quick with their feet managed to escape, while the rest were buried here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defeat of those forces had caused a slight tremble in the hearts of Mu Chen’s party. Although they had a stronger formation, it was possible for all of them to be buried here if they were careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their formation was nearly half of the Great Havenlaw Domain’s forces. If they were to be buried here, it would definitely be a serious blow to the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tidal waves of troops whistled through the darkness and the commotion even caused the sky to lightly tremble. Mu Chen sharply swept his gaze over this land that was before that troop, then a powerful Spiritual Energy undulated around him in preparation to fight at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, it was just a mere few hundred miles journey and they had suffered the obstruction of more than ten zombie troops. It was so much so that they had even encountered a troop that wasn’t any weaker than themselves. That battle had caused them casualties and even the Spiritual Sword King had suffered injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The danger in this Death Ruin had far exceeded their expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We should be deep in the Death Ruin now.” Mu Chen raised his head as he slowly said with a bright light in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Kings heard his words, they had instantly tensed their bodies. Nine Nether had swept her gaze around, before knitting her brows. “Why is it so quiet, without any silhouettes of zombie troops?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The den of a tiger forbids the entry of other wild animals.” Mu Chen suddenly squinted his eyes as he looked into the distance and softly said, “Be cautious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His figure had flown out with a surging Spiritual Energy protecting him his body. Behind him, the alliance had gone into a formation and followed him from behind with caution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The troop quietly flew towards a black mountain range that was void of vitality, which was before them. Mu Chen’s figure had suddenly stopped and he suddenly narrowed his eyes with a shock that appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, the faces of the Kings had also frozen. They couldn’t help inhaling a mouthful of chilled air a brief moment later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What the hell…?” The Kings couldn’t help exclaiming out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s lips twitched as he looked up ahead. Behind that mountain range was an endlessly dark plain, with a massive zombie troop that had spread out. Those silhouettes were like trees that stood towering on the ground without any movements, but there was a majestic, rotten Battle Will that swept out, causing the entire heavens and earth to tremble beneath it.</span></p>

Those period troops that they had encountered earlier paled in comparison to this.</span></p>

His troop only had 20,000, at best. But, right now, their opponent had an army of a few hundred thousand with a genuine Battle Formation Master amongst them. Not to mention them, even if the Three Emperors were present, they would be extremely fearful as well.</span></p>

The Kings were all inferior compared to him in the field of Battle Will. Therefore, he could tell how massive and powerful the Battle Will before them was with some vaguely abnormal undulations that made even Mu Chen feel that his scalp was numbing. If he had guessed correctly, there must be a genuine Battle Formation Master hidden amongst that army.</span></p>

They directed their gazes over and saw a huge army making their way over, before stopping outside the plain like them. When they settled down, Mu Chen could clearly hear their shocked commotions.</span></p>

Just as he had expected, the army of the Sky Profound Palace had also managed to break through the layers of obstruction and made it here.</span></p>

With these fellows here, then there’s a chance for them to break through this current situation.</span></p>
