Along with every step, her default silvery long hair was turning black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a few breath’s time, her radiant and cold hair had become as black as ink.</span></p>

If she was usually serene like a lotus in a deep valley with outstanding independent charm, the current her was emitting a cold chill. Her crystal-clear eyes were filled with chill, as if she was a queen that overlooked everyone like ants before her throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Ji Xuan and Xue Tianhe blinked their eyes as they looked at Luo Li’s current state with heavy gazes. Clearly, they had a strange, dangerous feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they did not speak as they knew that Luo Li naturally had her own trump cards. However, they also weren’t people that were easy to mess with; and, right now, with the both of them joining hands, it would definitely not be an easy task for Luo Li to face the two of them, even if she possessed a powerful trump card.</span></p>

She lightly placed both of her hands together and formed an ancient seal as her soft voice resounded.</span></p>

The Spiritual Energy existing between the heavens and earth was also going berserk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense fluctuations appeared behind Luo Li; and, after that, under countless startled gazes, a vast river appeared, and the end of the river couldn’t be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That river was extremely radiant. It was wriggling as if it was an ancient dragon, leaving others stunned by it. Although this river was just an illusion, the vastness that it gave off left countless others in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so much so that even the Deans of the various Spiritual Academies had slightly changed, startled expressions on their faces. The Five Great Deans blinked with graveness as they looked at the ancient river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy between the heavens and earth instantly turned violent.</span></p>

The fighter was slim and graceful as it hovered above the ancient river and her appearance was somewhat similar to Luo Li, but at the same time, it wasn’t. She lightly flapped her wings as an indescribable beauty was being emitted. Everyone in this world lost colour in comparison to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was like the embodiment of beauty.</span></p>

The former had his brows tightly locked together, while the latter seemed to have figured something out as a smear of astonishment flashed across his eyes, before he cried, “That’s the… Luo River's Spirit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo River's Spirit?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Great Thousand World, the Myriad Beast Records was divided into two rankings, and the Earth Ranking was a category of Spiritual Beasts; thus, it was sometimes known as the Spiritual Beast Records. Within the Spiritual Beast Records, there was a type of Spiritual Beast that was Ranked 5th, the Luo River's Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From a certain angle, the Luo River's Spirit was the most mysterious type of existence in the Spiritual Beast Records, since it wasn’t born through a bloodline, but a mysterious type of existence that used the Luo River as the mother’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the primordial times of the Great Thousand World, there was a mysterious river known as the Luo River. That river seemed to have existed from the primordial times, being extremely ancient and the power contained within it was endless and profound. However, it was destroyed in a dreadful tribulation from a foreign invasion. After that, it was extremely rare for the Luo River's Spirit to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Luo River's Spirit required a harsh condition to be born. Not only did it require the Luo River to act as a mother’s body, but it also required someone to be perfectly compatible with it to fuse with when it was still in the infant stage within the mother’s body. Otherwise, the instant a Luo River’s Spirit was born, it would disappear into nothingness and fade away into the Luo River.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fusion was extremely bizarre as well. Not only would it not cause any harm to the main body, it would complement both parties on the path of cultivation. Thus, it was known as something that cultivators would drool at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the primordial times, before the Luo River was destroyed, there was a group of experts that was extremely compatible with the Luo River’s Spirit, and this particular group was a powerful force that played a huge role in protecting the Great Thousand World from that tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now that the Luo River was destroyed, it was clearly impossible for that group to return to glory like it had in the past. Thus, the Luo River’s Spirit gradually became the most mysterious Spiritual Beast within the Spiritual Beast Records.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four upper rankings of the Spiritual Beast Records were the Four Great Spirits: the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird and the Black Tortoise. However, they were only symbolic as the bloodlines possessed by those four were impossible to be restricted to the Spiritual Beast Records. Not only did they possess high rankings within the Spiritual Beast Records, it was even more fearsome in the Myriad Beast Records’ Heavenly Rankings, which was also commonly known as the Divine Beast Records, in which their rankings were also at the top ranks. The sole reason why those four occupied the top four rankings of the Spiritual Beast Records was that they were required to get through their infant stages before becoming a genuine Divine Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, speaking from a certain angle, the first rankings of the Spiritual Beast Records could be considered the Luo River’s Spirit, which was at the fifth ranking…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the Luo River’s Spirit also possessed the ability to evolve. Although it wasn't bound by bloodlines, it was extremely dreadful when it evolved, the Luo River’s Spirit would become the Luo River’s God. The strength it possessed could only be rivalled by those Sovereign Divine Beasts that had been cultivating for countless years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was why the Luo River’s Spirit was extremely rare at this time, which was the reason why Xue Tianhe and Ji Xuan’s faces were so unsightly when they saw Luo Li summon that image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She’s actually the host of a Luo River’s Spirit, how is that possible…?” Ji Xuan muttered with his brows knitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although the Luo River has already been destroyed, there are still remnants of it, and within the Luo God Clan, there is a hidden Luo River. However, I never expected that that puny remnant of the Luo River could actually give birth to a Luo River’s Spirit, really… what good fortune!” Xue Tianhe’s face was ashen as he spoke with his teeth gritting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s the case.” Ji Xuan nodded his head from his explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, but there’s nothing to fear. That Luo River’s Spirit is still at its infant stage. It hasn't fully grown up yet!” Xue Tianhe spoke with a cold snort.</span></p>

His arms, which were hideous and scarlet-red in colour to begin with, were inserted into the head of the Demonic Blood Beast. After that, everyone witnessed his arms violently wriggling, as if a fresh blood-red being was constantly being injected into the Demonic Blood Beast.</span></p>

In an instant, torrential ominous aura engulfed the heavens and earth as a hundred foot bloody light gushed forth. It was like a roaring dragon that ran along the bizarre sound waves that shot towards Luo Li.</span></p>
