 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, a splendour of pleasant surprise dazzled in Nine Nether’s eyes. Shortly after, she felt a little disbelief as it was something that the Demonic Lightning Sect could not accomplish even after so many years, and Mu Chen only used four days to find the fluctuation of the Nether Demon Heart Lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It shouldn’t be wrong.” Mu Chen also nodded his head excitedly as he lowered his head to his own hands and said with a grave expression, “But the Nether Demon Heart Lightning is truly overbearing. Only the soundwave of the lightning alone made me lose myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nether Demon Heart Lightning is one of the more bizarre lightning in the world. Not only is it violent like the other lightning energies, but the offensive ability of it is also the sound of thunder, the Lightning Burst,” said Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lightning Burst?” Mu Chen narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nether Demon Heart Lightning can disregard a majority of the defences. It is born from the heart, so it will directly appear in a person’s heart. The Lightning Burst will cause a disorder to a person’s thoughts, allowing the heart demon to rise. It is so much so that the person will not be able to control their own Spiritual Energy, or even suffer the backlash from their own Spiritual Energy and die.” Nine Nether’s expression was also a little solemn. Clearly, she was fearful of the Nether Demon Heart Lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an attack that one could hardly defend against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s face was filled with astonishment. Wouldn’t that mean that no matter how powerful the physical body was, the Nether Demon Heart Lightning could disregard the defences of the physical body? No wonder such a bizarre energy could be ranked equal to the Undying Flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it here, his interest for the Nether Demon Heart Lightning grew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, I also want to take a look at the legendary Nether Demon Heart Lightning.” Nine Nether sweetly smiled. Her great interest for the Nether Demon Heart Lightning was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head and was stretched his hand out towards Nine Nether, who was prepared to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether directed her slender eyes over in doubt, but her face was filled with smiles. “What? Little Mu Chen, you want to take advantage of this Big Sister?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s lips twitched as he helplessly said, “The Demonic Earth Lightning in this region is very violent. If you rush in recklessly, you might suffer the attacks from them, and I can make use of the Lightning Controlling Art to avoid them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” Nine Nether’s rosy lips gently raised as she smiled. She stretched out her hand and place it on Mu Chen’s. “Then I will believe you this once. I don’t think you have the courage, anyways.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen held onto the warm and slim hand. Thereafter, he exerted a force on his arm and pulled the slender and tender girl into his embrace. His arm was embracing her waist as a fragrance blew over when his body came in contact with her warm body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bumping into Mu Chen’s embrace, Nine Nether was caught a little unprepared. But before she could struggle with reflex, Mu Chen’s voice resounded in her ears, “Don’t move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After speaking, Spiritual Energy surged from his body and enveloped the both of them. Mu Chen tapped his feet and they turned into a streak of light, swiftly flying towards the depths of the bottomless abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent Demonic Earth Lightning swiftly flew past the two of them. Feeling the warmth from their bodily contact, even someone with Nine Nether’s composure felt her cheeks getting hot as she glared at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing her bashful gaze, Mu Chen could only dryly laugh as he increased his speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streak of light flew in the pitch-black lightning ocean, the Demonic Earth Lightning in their path would split apart by themselves, showing a clear pathway. Using the Lightning Controlling Art, Mu Chen could come and go as he wished in this lightning ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even though their path was clear, half a day had already passed when Mu Chen reached the area that his intent had sensed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streak of light that flew in the dark lightning ocean with a speed that was as swift as lightning was starting to slow down. Spiritual light gradually faded away and revealed the figure of Mu Chen and Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether gently placed her hand on Mu Chen’s chest and pushed him a step away, immediately breaking free from his hold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can there be someone like you that abandons me after using me?” Mu Chen said, looking indignant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether rolled her eyes at him. She found it funny and annoying at the same time. She paid no attention to him and directed her gaze up ahead, and her face immediately turned a little grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had also stopped his playing mood and directed his gaze over as well. Up ahead was a pitch-black region, a void region that looked as if there wasn’t anything there and yet no Demonic Earth Lightning dared to go near.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pitch-black region looked as if it was the death hole, it was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nether Demon Heart Lightning that I have sensed is here.” Mu Chen said in a deep voice. Although it was quiet here, he had uncontrollably tensed his body up without knowing why. It was because his body had sensed the danger, so it went into a defensive mode by reflex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether gently nodded her head. Both of them exchanged a look and gently nodded their heads, before the two of them strode out at the same time. They walked out of the lightning ocean and stepped directly into the pitch-black empty void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any sound as the two of them cautiously moved forth. Roughly a few minutes later, Nine Nether abruptly narrowed her eyes. Before she could even say anything, a weird roar of thunder that sounded like ghostly howls suddenly resounded within her and Mu Chen’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of their bodies instantly turned stiff. Especially Mu Chen, he had veins crawling up on his face. His face that was initially handsome was looking especially savage right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That bizarre thunderous roar rang out from the depths of his heart. As the thunderous roar fluctuated, it had instantly made him lose control of the Spiritual Energy in his body. If it wasn’t for him having a firm foundation, he would have lost control long ago. But even so, he couldn’t move right now, as if he had lost control of his own body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was trying his best to defend against the thunderous roar deep in his heart, Nine Nether, who stood before him, had tensed up her body, before relaxing, bit by bit. Purple flames swiftly ignited and enveloped her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her hand that was blazing with purple flames held onto Mu Chen’s. The purple flames swept out and poured into his body as sounds of blazing flames started to cover the thunderous roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gradually recovered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether slightly turned her head, revealing her face with pointy and fair cheeks, “Use the Undying Flames to defend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. His Sovereign Sea rolled and as the Spiritual Energy surged, strands of Undying Flames seeped out. Although his Undying Flames weren’t as robust as Nine Nether’s, it was enough to defend his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them advanced further and with every step they took, there would be a thunderous roar that suddenly ringing from the depths of their hearts. However, they had already brought up their guards, and in addition to the power of the Undying Flames, their steps were slow, but they still managed to advance, step by step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen quietly counted in his heart. When the thunderous roar rang out for the one-thousandth time, he finally sensed that Nine Nether, who was walking at the front, had stopped, thus causing him to come to a stop as well. He raised his face, which was a little pale at this moment, and looked up ahead, which caused him to immediately narrow his eyes.</span></p>

There seemed to be a strange light that was vaguely appearing in the darkness, giving off a dull-grey lustre.</span></p>

There must definitely be something in there!</span></p>

Her body was already tensed up right now as the Undying Flames blazed. She stared at the dull-grey spot and her voice gradually turned cold. “The Nether Demon Heart Lightning is right before your eyes!”</span></p>

Purple flames rose in his eyes and, thereafter, a distortion seemed to appear in the dull-grey space. Vaguely, he saw a massive incorporeal python the size of roughly a thousand feet coiled in that location. Its gaze that was eerie without any expression was coldly staring at him.</span></p>

He never thought that the Nether Demon Heart Lightning would have turned into a snake form. Looks like it couldn’t be underestimated, even he didn’t know if he could subdue it with the help of Nine Nether.</span></p>

As grey light surged, there was a broken tablet that was faintly visible.</span></p>

Concentrating her gaze, she saw light circulating on the broken tablet, where some primitive words were gradually appearing.</span></p>

Back in the years when he roamed in the Great Thousand World, his name was well-known. When the Tribulation of the Great Thousand World came, god-knows how many experts of the fiend clans fell in his hands. But it was also in that Tribulation that he went missing. I never expected to see this Supreme Demon Heart Scripture here.” Nine Nether said with astonishment.</span></p>

She could see that the words of the ‘Supreme Demon Heart Scripture’ on it was not complete.</span></p>

His gaze gradually turned cold. He had exerted great effort to come here. So no matter what, he had to get the Nether Demon Heart Lightning today!</span></p>
