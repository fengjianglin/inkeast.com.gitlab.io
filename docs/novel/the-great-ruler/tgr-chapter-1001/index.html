 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>

Those voices were extremely mournful, which made this space seem a little eerie and would have one’s blood run cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at the front of those few streaks of light, Mu Chen was leading and was quietly sitting on the lightning mat. The suction force that exploded from his body was extremely powerful, so the streaks of light that he had pulled were also the most amongst the five of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos to protect himself, he did not have any worries like Han Shan, Mo Feng and the rest. Regardless of anything, he had to first enjoy the things here before speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poof! Poof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One streak of light after another charged over and shot into his body. As the Lightning Essences entered his body, he was swept by intense pain and his entire body was covered in blood. From the top to the bottom, there wasn’t an intact piece of flesh. He looked mutilated, and his looks couldn’t be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While his body was being mutilated, the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos on his arms were flickering with purple-golden lustres, as if they were rejoicing and greedily devouring the energy of the Lightning Essences that entered Mu Chen’s body. At the same time, they had also issued draconic roars and phoenix cries, which were enduring the intense pain in Mu Chen’s stead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even with their help, Mu Chen was still tortured by the intense pain to the point that he was dizzy and could only rely on his instincts and willpower to pull the streaks of light over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, his suction speed was getting faster to the point that as long as there were any streaks of light that passed by him, they would all be forcefully absorbed by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His insane absorption had caused Han Shan and the rest to feel their scalps going numb. Looking at the figure that was covered in blood by the Lightning Essences, they all felt fear in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That fellow was simply a madman!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with their Divine Beast Physiques, they did not dare to absorb this way. But as a human, Mu Chen had achieved it. Seeing his actions, Han Shan and the rest couldn’t help doubting themselves…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who’s the Divine Beast here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Shan and the rest glanced in the distance as they were getting closer to the light halo. At this moment, they had already travelled half the distance so, not long from now, they would enter the fourth level. At that time, the opportunity for them to baptise their bodies would also be lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if they knew that there weren’t many opportunities left, the four of them had inwardly shaken their heads and they gradually slowed down their absorption rate. That’s because they could sense that their bodies were on the verge of being unable to bear the intense pain brought by the baptism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were to force their way, they might damage their bodies instead, which the gains wouldn’t make up for the loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Mu Chen… that fellow should have used some special means. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be mad to that degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re simply benefitting that fellow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zong Teng’s face grew dark since he realised that Mu Chen, whom he had not placed much importance on, had been surpassing him time and time again after entering the Body Refining Pagoda, causing him to eat dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the fourth level, I must definitely find a way to get rid of him.” Killing intent surged in Zong Teng’s heart. Mu Chen had obtained too many benefits and if he allowed him to continue and Mu Chen managed to obtain any Quasi-Sacred Artifacts, then even he would have to hide from Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As killing intent surged in Zong Teng’s heart, the five lightning mats continued to travel. But this time, the speed of them pulling the streaks of light over had started to decrease, whereas Mu Chen grew even more insane. It’s as if he wished to obtain all the Lightning Essences here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the other four had turned red from looking, before they quickly shut their eyes. What the eyes don’t see, the heart doesn’t grieve over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time swiftly passed in this manner and after a long time, Han Shan and the rest had sensed something and opened their eyes. Before them, the light halo of the fourth level of the Body Refining Pagoda had become clear and the streaks of light were gradually reduced as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Turning their head over and seeing the streaks of light that were gradually being distanced from them, they couldn’t help sighing in pity. However, they weren’t ordinary people so they had quickly retracted the pity in their hearts and started to examine the improvements in their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The check had caused joy to appear on their faces and they could clearly sense the boundless energy in their bodies. Furthermore, through this refinement, their bodies had grown stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lightning Essence Baptism had brought them quite a considerable amount of benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were being happy from the improvements of their bodies, Mu Chen, who sat on the lightning mat before them, had also opened his eyes. When he opened his eyes, his body instantly radiated with a dazzling golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the golden light surged, his mutilated body had practically recovered in an instant and golden runes had vaguely formed on his skin. The runes were alike to dragon scales and phoenix wings, which looked extremely peculiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lowering his head to his arms, the purple-golden lustre of the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos had turned deeper. The True Dragon raised its claws and the claws looked sharper than before, shrouded with a purple light and it was emitting an indescribably sharp aura, which seemed like it could pierce through space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The True Phoenix wings appeared more gorgeous and as it unfolded its wings, it looked like it could fly a thousand miles and cover the heavens and earth…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially the eyes of the dragon and phoenix, compared to the tiny crack from before, their eyes had nearly opened halfway with imposing golden light beneath the eyelids, which would make one feel revere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos had grown stronger through this Lightning Essence Baptism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen noticed his changes, he couldn’t help rejoicing in his heart, before slowly clenching his fist. As his fingers closed, there seemed to be a terrifying surge of energy that could destroy mountains swiftly gathering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gently threw his fist out without any ripples. But in the path of his fist, space had appeared distorted. This was the power that he showed by purely relying on his own body. This was a fist that could shatter even a Sixth Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A satisfied smile was revealed on Mu Chen’s face. It looked like he had not been tormented for nought. The effects of Lightning Essence Baptism was even stronger than what he had experienced in the second level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if it wasn’t for him experiencing the torment on his body and will through the second level, perhaps even with the help of the True Dragon and Phoenix Tattoos right now, it would be tough for him to bear the intense pain at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After examining how strong he had gotten, Mu Chen stood up from the mat and looked at the four other mats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far from his left and right, the other four swiftly caught up. When they swept a glance at Mu Chen, although there wasn’t any expression on their faces, they felt slightly startled in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because they could feel that Mu Chen felt much more dangerous than before.</span></p>

It looked like Mu Chen’s strength would grow stronger every time he passed a level. When he saw Mu Chen before entering the Body Refining Pagoda, even if Mu Chen had some capability, it wasn’t anything worthy in his eyes.</span></p>

His eyes had also turned a little bit colder. Zong Teng had been making trouble for him time and time again. It looked like he also had to find a chance to make a move against Zong Teng.</span></p>

Compared to the opportunities in the Body Refining Pagoda, Zong Teng wasn’t considered much, which Mu Chen had clearly separated regarding this factor.</span></p>

He had gotten plenty of benefits from the third level, but he had no idea what sort of test awaited him in the fourth level.</span></p>
