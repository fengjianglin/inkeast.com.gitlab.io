 <p><strong>Chapter 336 - Complete Version of the Lightning God Physique</strong></p>
 <p>“You accept?”</p>
 <p>The bald old man appeared slightly surprised as he looked at Mu Chen. Previously, when he gave many lures and enticement, Mu Chen had always been hesitant and was struggling within his mind. He never thought that his final statements would actually make Mu Chen agree so straightforwardly.</p>
 <p>Giving only a faint smile, Mu Chen did not say anything more.</p>
 <p>“Truly an interesting little fellow.” At this moment, upon looking at Mu Chen’s eyes, the bald old man understood his intent, causing an additional sliver of admiration to grow towards the former. People that were able to differentiate gratitude and grudges were truly able to make people fond of them.</p>
 <p><em>Looks like this little fellow treasures a thing like friendship very strongly.</em></p>
 <p>“What time do we start?” Since he agreed, Mu Chen would naturally not have any more hesitation and immediately asked about the specifics.</p>
 <p>“Let’s do it now.”</p>
 <p>The bald old man said, “If you’re able to endure the Divine Black Lightning, I’ll pass you the complete version of the Lightning God Physique.”</p>
 <p>Patting Mu Chen’s shoulder, he continued talking, “Relax, I won’t let you go in there just to be cannon fodder. Once there’s a problem, I’ll immediately take action. After waiting for hundreds of years, waiting for just a little longer isn’t much.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll try my best.” Mu Chen replied while nodding his head.</p>
 <p>With a nod, the bald old man shifted his body and shot straight at the black lightning sea that occupied the mysterious space. However, he didn’t get too close, and stopped when he was around ten miles from the edge.</p>
 <p>“Go over there.”</p>
 <p>The bald old man pointed at a space not far from where he was, where a black stone platform stood floating in the air.</p>
 <p>Nodding his head, Mu Chen swept over and descended onto the stone platform. Upon sitting down, he felt a cold sensation radiating from it. A cold and refreshing aura seemed to coarse throughout his body, and under it, the hidden wounds that were left in Mu Chen’s body by the strength of the Divine Black Lightning started to gradually disappear.</p>
 <p>“This stone platform was cast using Lightning Refining Stones, and has some dispelling effects towards the strength of lightning. While you’re on it, it’ll help you reduce some of the pain,” the bald old man explained.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head, before panning around and stared at the bald old man.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Mu Chen had already completed his preparations, the bald old man raised his head to look at the unending sea of black lightning. In the next moment, he extended his withered finger, and gave the space a tap.</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>As the bald old man’s finger descended onto the space, it instantly started to intensely warp and distort. Spatial lines started to ripple out, before transforming into something akin of spatial chains. Directly passing through space, they went straight into the lightning sea.</p>
 <p>Bang! Rumble!</p>
 <p>Familiar low and deep rumbling sounds that caused people’s heart to tremble resounded. Turning his head around, Mu Chen saw a black lightning bolt, approximately ten metres long, being tangled up by the spatial chains, like a giant python, before being dragged out from within the lightning sea.</p>
 <p>The black lightning bolt struggled intensely, causing destructive lightning energies to continuously gush out from it. However, it was still unable to cause the slightest movement towards the seemingly weak spatial chains.</p>
 <p>Looking at this spectacle, Mu Chen quietly smacked his lips. The Northern Sea Dragon was undeniably a super strong existence of the 9th-Grade Sovereign level. Within his hands, the Divine Black Lightning was akin to a baby, unable to put up even an ounce of resistance.</p>
 <p>As the bald old man dragged the Divine Black Lightning out from the lightning sea, with a clench of his palm, the spatial chains wrapping around the Divine Black Lightning violently contracted. Instantly, sparking sounds erupted out as the size of the Divine Black Lightning unexpectedly started to rapidly shrink. At the same time, the destructive energies present within it also started to rapidly grow weaker.</p>
 <p>After a short span of a few breaths, the Divine Black Lightning was now only about ten centimetres thick. Obviously it had been weakened by quite a bit.</p>
 <p>“That should be enough.” said the bald old man as he looked towards Mu Chen and said, “Are you ready?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen shot a look at the Divine Black Lightning. The destructive energies contained within it seemed to be around the same as the one that he had endured during Nine Nether’s tribulation. Thinking about it, he should be able to endure this bolt.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Taking a deep breath, Mu Chen nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Without continuing to be polite, with a wave of his palm, the Divine Black Lightning shot forward. Carrying along its destructive energies, it violently descended onto Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>On Mu Chen’s body, Spiritual Energy burning with black flames instantly erupted as a faint silvery colour surfaced onto his skin. Obviously, he had also activated his Lightning God Physique without restraint.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Just as he had completed activating his defenses, the Divine Black Lightning heavily stuck against the body of Mu Chen with a loud bang.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At the instant of being struck, Mu Chen suffered something similar to a heavy blow, and he almost seemed to fly backwards. Despite that, clenching his teeth, he stuck firmly to the stone platform. As this happened, the Spiritual Energy that was burning in black flames was rapidly being compressed and dissolved.</p>
 <p>In a short span of two breaths, Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy was forced back into his body. Following suit, carrying along its destructive energies, the Divine Black Lightning crazily gushed into his body.</p>
 <p>Chi! Chi!</p>
 <p>As the black lightning arced across the surface of Mu Chen’s body, intense pain that would make people faint spread, once again, across his body.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen tightly clenched his teeth and tremors faintly shook his body, Spiritual Energy crazily erupted from his body, trying its best to resist the surge of the Divine Black Lightning energy.</p>
 <p>However, it was clear that his little bit of Spiritual Energy was unable to be of much use, since it quickly became completely submerged, and the black lightning liquid started to wreak havoc within Mu Chen’s body. His meridians started to distort under the impact, while horrifying cracking noises started to erupt from his muscles and bones.</p>
 <p>As the intense pain continued to spread out, blood started to spurt out of his mouth, while a wave of dizziness rushed through his mind, in an attempt to make him faint. However, he understood that once he fainted, he would lose all control, allowing the havoc-causing Divine Black Lightning energy to cause a whole load of destruction within his body.</p>
 <p>The black lightning light enveloped Mu Chen, sparkling as it arc around malevolently.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, the bald old man started to get slightly anxious. If Mu Chen was unable to endure the Divine Black Lightning, his hopes on this matter of his would seemingly be dashed.</p>
 <p>“Endure it,” said the bald old man in a low voice.</p>
 <p>Dizziness continuously surged through him. However, just as he was feeling somewhat difficult to endure the intense pain, a cold and refreshing aura suddenly erupted within his body. As this surge within his body grew, the intense pain with Mu Chen’s body had suddenly been dispelled by quite a bit. As of now, the devastating black divine lighting that was wreaking havoc was now lacking a sliver of craziness.</p>
 <p>This was the Lighting Refining Platform at work.</p>
 <p>Sighing a breath of relief, Mu Chen clenched his teeth and continued to endure. Only after approximately half an hour, did he slowly open his eyes. At this time, the Divine Black Lightning around his entire body had already completely dissipated, with a large majority having scattered within his body.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s face was pale, and every slight movement would cause pain akin to his flesh being split apart, causing incomparable pain.</p>
 <p>“You’ve succeeded!” said the bald old man in gratisfaction as he descended.</p>
 <p>With a bitter laugh, Mu Chen did not say anything, opting to close his eyes while observing the injuries within his body.</p>
 <p>As the bald old man waved his hand, boundless and majestic Spiritual Energy erupted out and gushed into Mu Chen’s body, helping him rapidly treat his wounds, while allowing him to completely recover from the injuries left behind by the Divine Black Lightning.</p>
 <p>Under the help of the bald old man, within tens of minutes, Mu Chen’s injuries were completely healed.</p>
 <p>“Again?” Seeing that Mu Chen had already recovered, the bald old man instantly asked with a grin.</p>
 <p>A cold shiver shook through Mu Chen. However, no tears came out from his eyes as he nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Crackles of thunder resounded once again.</p>
 <p>As time slowly ticked by into the late afternoon, Mu Chen had suffered the feeling of his flesh and skin being split apart time and time again, while hovering between life and death. He could even smell the burnt flavor coming from his body. As of now, his entire body was akin to a piece of immovable wood.</p>
 <p>On the Lightning Refining Platform.</p>
 <p>As the eighteenth bolt of Divine Black Lightning gradually dissipated, Mu Chen was finally unable to endure the pain. Collapsing on the stone platform, his face was deathly pale, while he continuously gasped for air. Currently, his body felt as if it had already shattered.</p>
 <p>As the bald old man descended onto the Lightning Refining Platform, his palm pressed against Mu Chen, while Spiritual Energy erupted out. After checking the injuries in Mu Chen’s body, he removed his palm.</p>
 <p>With some difficulty, Mu Chen recovered some of his strength. However, he felt extremely tired, not even having the wish to move his fingers. Although he was tired, Mu Chen was able to feel that his Lightning God Physique had seemingly become stronger. This kind of self-torture truly had some benefits.</p>
 <p>Bringing about a black glow, the bald old man’s withered palm swept across Mu Chen’s body. In the next moment, Mu Chen saw black spots appearing on his body. Akin to a liquid, they circulated around, while radiating with fluctuations that made people feel unease.</p>
 <p>This was the Divine Black Lightning Poison. However, it was obvious that the lightning poison present within Mu Chen’s body was much thicker than before.</p>
 <p>Staring at those black spots, Mu Chen felt his scalp turn numb. After all, no one would feel comfortable to have such life-threatening things within their body.</p>
 <p>“There’s already enough lightning poison. This should be able to mask your aura,” the bald old man said while nodding his head. Those words were akin to removing a heavy load off of Mu Chen’s shoulders. <em>Thank god, I don’t need to continue being struck by lightning.</em></p>
 <p>“Next up, I’ll pass the complete version of the Lightning God Physique to you. Afterwards, I’ll tell you how you can control the Divine Black Lightning Poison.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Mu Chen’s mind instantly shook. After enduring so much pain, he could finally get some compensation.</p>
 <p>With a smile, the bald old man extended his withered finger and gave a tap on Mu Chen’s forehead. As the finger sparkled with a lightning light, a sliver of lightning light liquid followed his finger and drilled into Mu Chen’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Just as the lightning light liquid drilled into Mu Chen’s forehead, he instantly felt an astonishing peal of lightning erupting within his mind. While his body instantly gave a faint tremble, a majestic and complicated piece of information appeared like a surging tide.</p>
 <p>Lightning God Physique, Middle Rank Deity Tier Spiritual Art of the Body-Refining category. Able to harvest the lightning energies of the heavens and earth to refine and strengthen one’s body. Besides being overbearing, one could rely on one’s fleshly body to shatter space, while possessing the strength to shift mountains.</p>
 <p>As one acquires higher accomplishments in this Divine Art, its power would be comparable to a High Rank Deity Tier Spiritual Art.</p>
 <p>“Comparable to a High Rank Deity Tier Spiritual Art…”</p>
 <p>While muttering those words, Mu Chen sighed in shock. Body-refining Divine Arts were rare, and he never thought that the Lightning God Physique would be that strong. When one fully mastered it, it’s power would be no weaker than a High Rank Deity Tier Spiritual Art! One wasn’t even able to buy a Divine Art of this grade within the Spiritual Values Hall!</p>
 <p>As for the matter of being struck by lightning. After suffering that much pain, the benefits reaped weren’t little, too.</p>
 <p>After an instant, Mu Chen withdrew the rampaging emotions within his heart. Proceeding to calm his mind down, he started to observe and emulate the entire process of learning this Divine Art.</p>
