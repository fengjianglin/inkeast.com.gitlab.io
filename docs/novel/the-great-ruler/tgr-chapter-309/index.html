 <p><strong>Chapter 309 - Underground</strong></p>
 <p>Floating in midair, Mu Chen discovered those gazes aiming towards him, sparkling with suspicion. Unable to help it, he faintly curled his lips and said, “The weakness of this Spiritual King is clearly on its forehead. Your messy attacks, even if you attack it for a day, might not even be able to cause damage to it.”</p>
 <p>Only upon hearing this did everyone gawk, before hurriedly turning their vision towards the Spiritual King. At this time, the eye-piercing glow on the latter’s forehead was somewhat restrained. Faintly, one could seemingly see that on the position of its forehead was a gemstone that seemed to be the approximate size of a human head. That gemstone was sparkling with an eye-piercing glow, while frightening Spiritual Energy fluctuations continuously radiated from within it.</p>
 <p>Everyone stared at the eye-piercing gemstone before realising in a flash. So that was the weak spot of the Spiritual King. This was why Mu Chen’s strike was able to force it back.</p>
 <p>From Zhao Qingshan’s and Mu Fengyang’s faces, one could clearly notice that they had taken a slight breath of relief. If Mu Chen truly possessed the strength to force the Spiritual King back head-on, exactly how frightening was the strength he possessed?</p>
 <p>If Mu Chen truly possessed such strength, who was able to snatch the Spiritual King Spiritual Light from him?</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>While they were in the process of realisation, the gigantic body of the Spiritual King started to erupt in a bright and resplendent glow once again. The attack it had received to the gemstone on its forehead had seeming enraged it. While it roared, a gigantic streak of Spiritual Energy descended from the skies, akin to a light beam, violently rumbling towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>Having made ample preparation, Mu Chen immediately exhibited the [Soaring Dragon Technique]. As the dragon shade rolled and unfurled, his figure had already appeared a thousand metres behind the Spiritual King, evading the light beam.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>The light beam descended on the ground, smashing the earth apart, creating a gigantic pit. Faintly, there seemed to be some sparkling light.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen shot a look at the gigantic pit, while slightly gawking. However, before he could process it clearly, a gigantic shadow had already enveloped him. The Spiritual King’s gigantic hand and already ferociously patted over.</p>
 <p>Space exploded as Mu Chen hurriedly exhibited the [Dragon Soaring Art], evading the gigantic palm the moment it made contact with him.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen showed himself again, a grave expression all over his face, as his heartbeat sped up by a bit. The attack if this Spiritual King was too terrifying. He should definitely not let it near him. If not, the injury he would receive would not be light.</p>
 <p>“Attack the gemstone on its forehead together!”</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the other people had sobered up at this moment. With explosive roars, they shot and flashed over. Swift and fierce attacks started to rumble and shoot towards the gemstone on the Spiritual King’s forehead that was sparkling with eye-piercing brilliance one after another.</p>
 <p>Facing the group of attacks heading towards its weak point, the Spiritual King did not directly receive the attacks this time. Raising its gigantic hands, it completely blocked the incoming attacks.</p>
 <p>However, the combined attacks of everyone had some crafty ones mixed in. Even though the Spiritual King had tried to block, there were still numerous attacks that violently smashed against the gemstone. The gigantic body of the Spiritual King was, once again, forced back.</p>
 <p>However, as its body retreated, it, once again, resisted the many incoming attacks and stood back at its original position.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Enormous Spiritual Energies gushed out from its palm in the form of light beams, smashing a few unfortunate fellows till they vomited blood and were shot away. Their auras were instantly depressing, before a ray of light descended from the sky, sending them away.</p>
 <p>Facing this kind of loss, everyone only shot a glance before violently attacking with rapt attention again. Blade lights and sword glints blotted the skies, screaming as they violently chopped and hacked at the eye-piercing gemstone on the Spiritual King’s forehead.</p>
 <p>This Spiritual King had indeed only been born not that long ago. Although it still possessed quite terrifying strength, it appeared rather sluggish, as if it had not yet reached the degree of fullness and smoothness.</p>
 <p>Due to this, Zhao Qingshan and the rest dared to focus their attention to its forehead. If the Spiritual King had passed through this newly-born phase, its strength would violently increase. At that time, even they might not be able to escape through the gap of its teeth.</p>
 <p>Everyone continued in their assault. At the same time, their losses had also continued. The original number of hundreds had now been left with only half of that. The rest had already been sent out of the Spiritual Light World with a pat from the Spiritual King.</p>
 <p>This level of loss could be called disastrous.</p>
 <p>However, although their losses were disastrous, the Spiritual King was forced to consume quite a bit of its energy. Its attacks were already not as wild and violent as the initial ones, with it only focusing tenaciously to defend the gemstone on its forehead.</p>
 <p>“Haha, everyone increase your power! This Spiritual King is indeed a newborn! Its strength isn’t as powerful as we’ve imagined! As long as we can evade its attacks, it’s all good!” Floating in midair, Mu Fengyang looked towards that Spiritual King, whose attacks were gradually weakening, before shouting out with a big chuckle.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, a shock went through everyone’s mind as they sped up their assault.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen had also sent a streak of Spiritual Energy rumbling out. However, his eyes were continuously sparkling. This Spiritual King’s strength was, indeed, not as strong as he had expected. Was it truly due to it being just born?</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s vision swept past the place where the Spiritual King stood as his brows faintly wrinkled. There was a huge pit on the ground that was caused by its step. However, regardless of how everyone attacked, the Spiritual King did not even leave that boundary.</p>
 <p>“Exactly what’s up?” murmured Mu Chen as he stared at the patch of ground, frowning faintly.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>While Mu Chen was muttering to himself, the Spiritual King extended his gigantic hand. Ten thousand rays of light erupted out, violently smashing straight at Mu Fengyang, who was trying to boost everyone’s morale.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the Spiritual King had locked onto him, the face of Mu Fengyang faintly changed. Just as he had evaded the rays of light, his eyes caught a glimpse of Mu Chen, who was not far behind him. At this moment, a faint flash sparkled within his eyes.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>His body suddenly flew sideways, appeared coincidentally in front of Mu Chen. At the same time, the Spiritual King’s gigantic hand had already ferociously covered over them, enveloping the two of them.</p>
 <p>Under the envelope of its shadow, Mu Chen sobered up from his slightly absentminded state. After seeing what’s in front of him, his expression immediately changed.</p>
 <p>“HeHe.”</p>
 <p>A smile with ill intent surfaced from the corner of Mu Fengyang’s mouth. Spiritual Light erupted from his body, as a thick suit of deep yellow Spiritual armor appeared on his body, tightly enveloping him within it.</p>
 <p>This Spiritual armor was obviously a pretty good defensive Spiritual Artifact.</p>
 <p>“Bye-bye.” A cold laugh rang out as the Spiritual Armor enveloped Mu Fengyang’s body within it.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s eyes turned frosty as he thought, ‘This fellow is actually trying to lure trouble to me.’ He wanted to take advantage of the Spiritual King’s strength to shove Mu Chen out of the Spiritual Light World. However, this Mu Fengyang was too naive. Did he think that by doing this, he would be able to bind Mu Chen’s hands such that he would be unable to do anything about the incoming attack?</p>
 <p>A black light gushed forth in front of Mu Chen’s body as a black pagoda surfaced, before enveloping Mu Chen within it.</p>
 <p>The Nine-layered Pagoda possessed extremely strong defensive capabilities, and was considered the strongest defense Mu Chen had. If its defensive capabilities were genuinely discussed, even Mu Fengyang’s Spiritual Armor would be inferior to it.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As the Nine-layered Pagoda enveloped Mu Chen within it, the Spiritual King’s gigantic palm had violently patted down. A metallic sound rang out, as the two of them were immediately patted into the ground, violently piercing through the earth. A deep and gigantic pit was formed from their impact.</p>
 <p>Spurt!</p>
 <p>In a sorrowful state, Mu Fengyang crawled out from the gigantic pit. Spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, he lowered his head to look at the Spiritual armor on his body. There were some cracks on its surface. This filled his heart with pain. Turning his head, he proceeded to look at the deep pit not far from him. Dust and smoke had filled the air there. Under that sudden attack, it looked like that fellow had definitely suffered serious injuries.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see how you’re gonna snatch the Spiritual Lights from us.” sneered Mu Fengyang coldly. Suppressing the injuries within his body, he rushed towards the horizon once again.</p>
 <p>The attack from the Spiritual King towards the two of them was seen by everyone. When Xu Huang and the rest saw only Mu Fengyang flying towards them, they felt slightly shocked. Looks like Mu Chen had suffered injuries that were not light this time.</p>
 <p>The actions that Mu Fengyang made were ambiguous, and no one had imagined that he would actually lure trouble towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen!” the facial expression of the three Wang brothers changed. They proceeded to shoot a suspicious look at the innocent-looking Mu Fengyang. However, since they did not have any evidence, it would not be good to speak up now.</p>
 <p>Everyone shook their heads in regret. However, the present situation did not allow for them to be distracted. Therefore, they had quickly refocused their minds on launching their assault on the gradually weakening Spiritual King.</p>
 <p>“ Mu Chen’s been hit!” From a distance away, upon seeing this play out in front of their eyes, the beautiful faces of An Ran and the girls instantly changed.</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s brows faintly bunched up. Her pupils shot a cold look at the floating Mu Fengyang; however, she did not overly panic. Saying in a soft voice, “ Relax, that Mu Fengyang had only received light injuries. Mu Chen isn’t that frail.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Luo Li had not a single trace of panic, An Ran and the girls were able to quickly calm down, before faintly nodding their heads.</p>
 <p>As the crowd of people in the air continued to encircle and launch their assault on the Spiritual King, no one had yet discovered Mu Chen’s figure appearing beside the black pagoda within the deep, dust-filled pit. He looked up towards the intense battle, before looking at the stretch of earth with sparkling eyes. Sending his fist rumbling out, he created another deep pit and jumped within it. Next, he proceeded to continue his onslaught towards the ground.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a deep hole was dug up by him. Mu Chen’s figure vanished into the hole. As he vanished, the black pagoda started to revolve, covering the hole up. This way, even if the dust that filled the air had dissipated, no would would be able to discover Mu Chen’s disappearance. They would only assume that he had hid within the black pagoda to recuperate.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Underground, Mu Chen’s body was covered with rippling black flames akin to armor as he continued to dig deeper into the ground. The thick earth and rocks were roasted and burnt away by the black flames.</p>
 <p>From the start, he had already discovered that something was slightly not right about this gathering point. Those Spiritual Knights would not vanish for no apparent reason. Furthermore, that Spiritual King wasn’t as strong as he had expected.</p>
 <p>Regardless of how they attack, that Spiritual King would not leave a hundred feet from it's location.</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, it seemed that it was guarding over something.</p>
 <p>Since there was nothing above the ground for it to defend, Mu Chen had decided to search below the ground.</p>
 <p>With a low roar, Mu Chen revolved his Spiritual Energy, increasing the speed at which he penetrated the earth. After approximately a minute or so, something flashed past his mind. The ground below his hand, unexpectedly, disappeared as his figure dropped down.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen hurriedly stabilised his figure. Spiritual Energy enveloped his body as he peered vigilantly at this subterranean space. As his vision looked over, the expression on his face started to freeze little by little.</p>
 <p>“This is…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen took a deep breath of this subterranean air that was filled with the smell of the earth as thick shock and astonishment erupted forth from his heart.</p>
