There wasn’t any hesitation, he endured the intense pain on his body and was about to control the Great Solar Undying Body to leave this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when he was about to move, the indifferent gaze of the little girl’s golden pupils were looking at him. After that, the little girl stood up and strode forth with her small legs.</span></p>

He no longer dared to move his body in the slightest, since the little girl had actually appeared before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had actually penetrated through the Sovereign Celestial Body that was protecting him and appeared right before him.</span></p>

Under the gaze of the golden pupils, he felt death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not doubt that this mysterious little girl before him could easily claim his life with a wave of her hand.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head with great effort before he could clearly see the little girl. Her complexion was exceedingly fair. Although there wasn’t any expression on her face, it was especially exquisite, a petite figure and long jet-black hair. If it was the usual time when he saw such a cute little girl, Mu Chen naturally wouldn’t feel troubled in his heart. But at this moment, his heart was filled with a chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he didn’t dare to sweep his gaze on the little girl’s naked body.</span></p>

Her fair, tiny hand was extended towards Mu Chen’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Mu Chen’s expression changed. He wanted to immediately retreat, but he realised with a shock that the space around him seemed to be frozen. It was so much so that his link with the Great Solar Undying Body was severed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength possessed by this girl was very terrifying.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint scarlet light abruptly surged from her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scarlet light wrapped around Mu Chen’s body. His heart trembled as he felt the intense pain in his body subsiding like a tidal wave…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a few breath’s time, the pain in his body had entirely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head in shock and saw the scarlet light that was wrapping around him was beginning to retreat, moving along the centre of his brows and travelled to the little girl’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the scarlet light was withdrawn, the little girl’s hand also briefly trembled. Her face, which had no expression, slightly moved; her expression seemed to be in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw this, he felt disbelief from his heart. This little girl could actually absorb the pain that others were feeling? Except that the pain that was absorbed would take effect on her body…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Which also meant that the intense pain that was torturing Mu Chen earlier was all borne by her. Facing such pain, she had only slightly changed her expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just what sort of monster was this little girl?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After absorbing the pain in Mu Chen’s body, the little girl no longer paid any attention to him and lifted her head to look at the Great Solar Undying Body. Golden light surged from her golden pupils, as if she wanted to probe this Sovereign Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked for a brief moment as golden light gathered in her eyes. Her petite figure abruptly jolted as she bit her lips. For the first time, there was an intense ripple in her voice. “This is… the Great Solar Undying Body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although her voice was soft, Mu Chen could still hear what she was saying. At this moment, he felt as if he was struck by lightning and looked at the little girl before him in astonishment. After all this time, this was the first time that someone had recognised the Great Solar Undying Body with a single glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you know of the Great Solar Undying Body?!” Mu Chen couldn’t help asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little girl paid no attention to him and lightly knitted her brows. Shortly after, she turned her head over to Mu Chen. Then, her fair hands seemed to have penetrated through space, before fell onto Mu Chen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s heart clenched as he felt his Sovereign Sea shaking. His psyche moved, and he senses the Immortal Page in his Sovereign Sea was trembling non-stop, as if there was a formless energy trying to forcefully extract it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he realised that, Mu Chen’s expression drastically changed on the spot. Shortly after, rage surged from his heart. The means of this little girl before him was too overbearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Immortal Page was Mu Chen’s greatest secret, it had clues linked to the Primordial Undying Body. No matter what, he absolutely would not allow it to be taken away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stomped his feet as the Great Solar Undying Body abruptly burst forth with dazzling light, breaking free from the energy that was binding him and his figure sharply retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when his figure had just flown out, light converged before him. The little girl was like a maggot clinging onto him. Her tiny hand was still stuck to Mu Chen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ferocious light surged in Mu Chen’s black pupils as he abruptly clenched his teeth shortly after and changed his seals, causing the Immortal Page in his Sovereign Sea to explode with mysterious purple light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, purple runes stretched out from the Immortal Page as it flew out of the Sovereign Sea. It appeared above Mu Chen’s head as it transformed into a large dark-purple mandala flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mandala flower gently blossomed as purple light shone down. It was like a vine as it bound the little girl’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The latter’s figure was stopped, and Mu Chen made use of the chance to retreat, breaking free from the little girl’s control. However, dense fear and alertness still filled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the binding of the purple light, the little girl did not struggle. Instead, she raised her head. She slightly knitted her brows as she looked at the blossoming mandala flower. After that, there was a smear of a sweet smile appearing on her face which initially had no expression on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked as if she had seen something she loved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple light shone down from the mandala flower. When it came in contact with the little girl’s body, it entered her body, bit-by-bit. Along with the purple light pouring in, the expression on her face gradually turned lively; thereupon, the indifference in her eyes had also slowly vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Mu Chen’s heart was filled with shock. He silently cast a glance at the Great Solar Undying Body and realised that the golden sludge that had enveloped the Sovereign Celestial Body was falling off in patches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The falling speed of the sludge gradually increased as dazzling golden light radiated from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was closely staring at the Great Solar Undying Body without blinking his eyes. He wanted to find out if he had successfully refined the Daluo Golden Body.</span></p>

Its massive body was brilliant gold in colour, as if it was forged with gold and was indestructible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, there were eight golden dragon runes on the surface of the body. Those dragon runes looked like they were embedded in the skin of the Sovereign Celestial Body, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws. They were vivid and lively. They were like protective dragons with incomparable prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Solar Undying Body quietly sat at the bottom of the Greatlaw Goldpond like a golden Buddha. The horrifying pressure could no longer penetrate through the Sovereign Celestial Body.</span></p>

According to Mu Chen’s calculations, a Sovereign Celestial Body with the Daluo Golden Body, he could also resist against the attacks of a Third Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze was faintly emitting a light as he looked at the Great Solar Undying Body. Clearly, the transformation of the latter left him satisfied. It was worth him suffering the bitter torment for this Daluo Golden Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was immersed in how powerful the Daluo Golden Body was for a brief moment before recovering, since there was still the mysterious and terrifying little girl before him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shifted his head towards the little girl that was immersed in the purple light of the mandala flower. His eyes were still filled with fear, since he knew that even if he had successfully refined the Daluo Golden Body, he was still feeble and weak before this little girl who possessed frightening strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze lightly flickered as he quietly changed his seals. The mandala flower instantly flew back and turned into a streak of purple light that entered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purple light that was shrouding the little girl was also dissipated at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little girl’s thin brows were instantly raised as she looked at Mu Chen with resentment and a golden light surged in her golden pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“*Cough* This is mine… I have to leave now.” Mu Chen felt his scalp numbing as he dryly laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little girl frowned her brows as she slightly crooked her head and pondered. She strode her tiny feet forth and flew towards Mu Chen. At the sight of the situation, the latter stretched his hands out in reflex as he took the little girl in his embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Placing his hand on the little girl’s petite figure, the sensations that came from his hands were smooth and tender, causing Mu Chen to be a little stunned. Shortly after, he abruptly recovered and had the urge to throw her away, since he knew that the little girl before him wasn’t as cute as she was on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he still managed to endure it. He lowered his head, seeing the little girl quietly lying in his embrace with her face stuck to his chest. Mu Chen could sense a purple light being emitted from the Immortal Page in his Sovereign Sea that poured into the body of the little girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at the little girl who was as exquisite as a doll, but there wasn’t any expression on his face. Perhaps because she had her eyes closed, his fear for her had weakened a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little girl seemed to be extremely fond of the Immortal Page in his body.</span></p>

He hesitated for a brief moment, then carefully asked, “Who are you? What is your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl still had her eyes shut, but after a long time later, she said in a soft voice.</span></p>
