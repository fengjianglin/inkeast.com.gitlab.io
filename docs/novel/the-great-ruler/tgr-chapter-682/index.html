 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That black cloud of an army stood quietly on the ninth stone stage as the commotion that was initially in this region weakened a little bit as many gazes had smears of astonishment flashing across their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because the army before them gave them a feeling that wasn’t any weaker than other strongest army under the other eight kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Nine Nether Troop of the Nine Nether Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never thought that the Nine Nether Troop would have such an imposing manner. Isn’t it said that the Nine Nether Troop was the weakest army in the Great Havenlaw Domain? Judging from this grandeur, it doesn’t seem like it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, looks like rumours cannot be believed. This Nine Nether Palace seems low-profiled but is actually concealing their strength and biding their time. Rumor has it that the lord of the Nine Nether Palace that had been missing for all these years had returned. I’m afraid that the Nine Nether Palace is about to rise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could it be that easy? Back then, when the Nine Nether King was in the Great HAvenlaw Domain, there wasn’t that many achievements of the Nine Nether Palace, it was incomparable to the eight kings. Now that she has returned, I’m afraid that it will still be tough for her to compete with the other eight kings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked at the boulder-like army that didn’t have any movements as some soft whispers rang out. The fame of the Nine Nether Palace wasn’t high. After all, Nine Nether’s strength wasn’t mighty in the past. Back then, when she became the lord of a palace, it attracted some criticism, but due to her having the support of the Sky Vulture Emperor and the background of the Nine Nether Bird Clan, no one said a word on the surface. But beneath it, there were many questions regarding Nine Nether’s position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is that youth?” When everyone had their attention on the Nine Nether Troop, they inevitably swept their gazes at the forefront. It was a youth with a slender figure and calm expression, which raised some voices of doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That young man is the Commander? Looks like this Nine Nether King is still the same as the past, did she really think that anyone can ascend positions in the Great Havenlaw Domain?” Some people couldn’t help sneering. Clearly, they were jealous by the fact that Mu Chen could become a Commander in the Great Havenlaw Domain at his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although the age of this Mu Chen isn’t too big, rumour has it that he was already in the Sovereign Realm. Two months ago, a Commander under the Blood Hawk King was defeated in a move by him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, defeating Commander Zhao doesn’t mean anything. This Nine Nether King seems to wish for Mu Chen to seize the quota of the Goldpond, it’s unavoidable for him to vie against the Four Great Domain Lords. Although this Mu Chen does have come capabilities, he is</span><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">still a few years too tender to be on the same level as the Four Great Domain Lords.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah… what you have said does make sense. This time, the Nine Nether King is clearly a little too rash. I’m afraid that not only will she not gain any brilliance, but she might also lose her face instead…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the appearance of the Nine Nether Troop, three additional light rays flew over and had descended on the throne on the ninth stone stage, which attracted numerous gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a slender and tall figure donned in black armour. Her battle armour outlined her exquisite and alluring figure. Her curves were charming as her hair casually fluttered, making her seem valiant and formidable-looking. The smooth and round snow-white skin beneath her battle skirt attracted quite a bit of sneaking glimpses. Some people even felt their mouths and tongues dry from her pair of legs, not to mention the owner of those legs who also possessed an explosive figure along with an elegant appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, such an outstanding woman, along with her high position, easily raised the conquering thoughts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure was naturally Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She swept her gaze around as she sat on the throne with Tang Bing and Tang Rou standing on her left and right. The both of them had the same appearance, but their temperaments were different. In a moment’s time, it became the location that attracted the most attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Nine Nether, your Nine Nether Palace has finally come. I originally thought that your Nine Nether Palace had given up. If that was the case, you might not have taken the qualification that you have painstakingly taken back so seriously.” When Nine Nether appeared, laughter had also resounded as well. On a stone stage not too far away, Blood Hawk King was smiling as he looked over at this direction, his laughter was straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Nine Nether coldly swept her gaze over at Blood Hawk King and said with indifference, “I don’t need the Blood Hawk King to worry on the matters of my Nine Nether Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King smiled as his palm gently caressed the armrest with a chill leaking from his scarlet eyes, making him look rather vicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone could sense the strange atmosphere between Nine Nether and the Blood Hawk King. The remaining kings also watched from the side with no intentions of getting involved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Nine Kings had an important position. Aside from the Nine Nether Palace, their strength was roughly similar. So there wasn’t anyone that would be genuinely convinced by the other. To compete for benefits and resources, they had crossed swords among themselves. Thus, this sort of war wasn’t unfamiliar. Naturally, there wouldn’t be anyone that would interfere and get themselves swept in it for no reason. Right now, Nine Nether wasn’t the same as the past as her strength even made the other kings feel fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood before the Nine Nether Troop as he calmly swept his gaze at the direction of the Blood Hawk Hall. In the vast stone stage, there was a similar army, but donned in red armour, that army was shrouded with a ferocious aura. Clearly, it was an army that was good at battle. Despite this Blood Hawk King being so domineering, there were experts as many as clouds as his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Mu, that is the Blood Hawk Troop of the Blood Hawk Hall, controlled by Wu Tian and Cao Feng together. For all these years, the cities belonging to our Nine Nether Palace were swept by the both of them, causing many cities to switch over to the Blood Hawk Hall.” Behind Mu Chen, Shan Yue said with indignance in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That bastard Cao Feng, if it weren’t for Lord Nine Nether, he would have died a dog’s death. And now, he’s helping others to deal with our Nine Nether Palace. If there’s a change, we of the Nine Nether Troop will definitely not let that scrape off!” Shan Yue gritted his teeth as he spoke. Clearly, his hatred for Cao Feng’s betrayal had reached the limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head with a calm expression. Just when he was about to speak, he sensed two cold gazes directed at him. He lightly lifted his head and saw Wu Tian and Cao Feng, who stood at the forefront of the Blood Hawk Troop directing their gazes at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their three gazes clashed together as a smear of a savage smile rose on the corner of Wu Tian’s lips. Cao Feng’s gaze was cold, filled with dense fighting intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, the Nine Nether Troop of the Nine Nether Palace was managed by him. Right now, Mu Chen’s position was similar to him in the past. Clearly, Nine Nether intended to have Mu Chen replace him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had already betrayed and left the Nine Nether Palace, Cao Feng still felt uneasy. If Mu Chen did better than him, wouldn’t that mean that he, Cao Feng, was incomparable to Mu Chen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a person that was similarly brought in the Great Havenlaw Domain by Nine Nether, it wasn’t something that Cao Feng could endure with his tiny breadth of mind. His character was clearly one that would instead turn his back on others instead of others turning their back on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there is a chance, I will try my best to prevent him from leaving the Goldpond Peak.” Cao Feng turned his head as he spoke to Wu Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, looks like you’re rather hateful of that fellow.” Wu Tian smiled with his eyes narrowed as he pat Cao Feng’s shoulder and continued, “It is natural to have injuries and death in the Goldpond competition. It doesn’t matter if one was too heavy with his hand. But our main objective is to ascend the peak. As for that fellow, the lord has already said that there will be someone to deal with him. I believe that he might not even have the chance to see the Goldpond.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Cao Feng smiled with regret. But that was also for the best. If that fellow didn’t even have the chance to see the Goldpond, it could clearly show how incapable he was. At that time, the Nine Nether Palace would definitely be a laughing stock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Mu, you definitely have to be cautious of those two fellows in the Goldpond competition.” When Cao Feng and Wu Tian were looking at Mu Chen with ill intentions, Shan Yue said to Mu Chen in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. He naturally saw gazes similar to a cat looking at mice in Wu Tian and Cao Feng. Except… the corner of his lips lift up a little, it was still unclear who the cat and mice were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fragrance blew over as Tang Bing slowly paced to Mu Chen’s side. Her gaze looked around, it was rather charming as she gave Mu Chen a light smile shortly after. That smile of hers instantly attracted a large patch of heated gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Housekeeper Tang, what instructions do you have?” Mu Chen couldn’t help smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing rolled her eyes at Mu Chen as she said, “Big Sister Nine Nether got me to tell you that there are nearly a hundred people in the competition of the Goldpond, not a single one of them is weak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s so many?” Mu Chen spoke out in astonishment, wasn’t it said that the qualifications were limited?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The three Lords increased the qualification to the competition of the Goldpond this time. Those that could participate isn’t only limited to the subordinates of the Nine Kings, even some subsidiary forces under the Great Havenlaw Domain also have a few qualifications.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, Tang Bing cast a glance at the direction of the Blood Hawk Hall with a smear of worry in her eyes. “But that isn’t good news for you. According to what I know, some subsidiary forces have good relations with the Blood Hawk Hall. To gain the favour of the Blood Hawk Hall, they might obstruct you from approaching the Goldpond.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly knitted his brows, his strength was, after all, too thin. Just dealing with Wu Tian and Cao Feng alone would require him to give it his all. If those fellows were to interfere, it might genuinely spell trouble for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Blood Hawk Hall is indeed hateful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen knitting his brows, Tang Bing couldn’t help nibbling her lips as she glanced at the stone stage far away, gritting her teeth and was about to turn around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Tang Bing, what you doing?” Mu Chen looked at her in doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m…” Tang Bing’s face flushed red a little as she said in a soft voice, “I’m going to look for Zhou Yue to have him help you clear those obstacles. This way, you will be able to save some strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she didn’t have any feelings towards Zhou Yue, she could only request his help at this point in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he looked at Tang Bing. Shortly after, he retracted his gaze and said indifferently, “I don’t need Miss Tang Bing to worry about this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing’s face slightly changed as she bit her lips and stared at Mu Chen. She apparently felt the indifference in his voice. Since they knew each other, this was still the first time she had seen such a pricking face of Mu Chen. Right now, his pupils were filled with chill, seeming rather charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“*Cough* Commander Mu, Big Sister Tang Bing doesn’t have any other thoughts, she just wishes for our Nine Nether Palace to achieve a good performance this round, so that it would look good on Lord Nine Nether.” Qiu Shan immediately said as he watched. Although he was much older than the latter, he had great respect for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words paused as he looked at Tang Bing, whose eyes had turned red. “Big Sister Tang, if you go looking for Zhou Yue, not only will it not look good for our Nine Nether Palace, I’m afraid that others might also say that Commander Mu needs a woman to intercede for him in the Goldpond competition… Although we all know of Commander Mu’s strength, gossip is, after all, a fearful thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing’s eyes grew red. She had always been strong, so she wasn’t willing to show her weak side at this moment. Her gaze reddened as she stared at Mu Chen. “I’m not looking down on you. Rumour has it that the Blood Hawk King has invited four experts whose strength is at the pinnacle of First Grade Sovereign Realm to deal with you. If Wu Tian and Cao Feng was added into the array, even if you are powerful, can you get through in one piece?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen narrowed both his eyes as he looked at Tang Bing, whose eyes were red but still kept up with a strong front. His heart softened as the indifferent expression gradually faded as he said in a soft voice, “Big Sister Tang Bing, rest assured. If they were to act against me, even if I can’t come out of this Goldpond Peak, they will all accompany me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s voice was calm and gentle, but there was an ominous aura and unconcealable self-confidence in his words that was heart-alarming. He wasn’t arrogant nor was he trying to show off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing looked at Mu Chen with her red eyes. The calm tone of the youth made her lose her courage to refute. Thus, she could only bite her rosy lips. That charming scene made her seem like she was being bullied, it was very lovely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, Mu Chen quickly felt many enmity gazes directed at him. Even among the Nine Nether Troop, there were many ill gazes as well. From this, it can be seen that Tang Bing was very well-received amongst the hearts of the Nine Nether Palace, far surpassing the importance of him as a Commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">*Cough.*</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing more and more ill gazes, Mu Chen dryly coughed as he said in a low voice, “Don’t be like this, Big Sister Tang Bing. Rest assured, my bones are tough. It won’t be easy for me to be beaten to death by others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing broke into laughter as she swept a glance at Mu Chen. “I can’t be bothered with you getting beaten to death. Consider this me being bothersome and asking for trouble. I deserved to be scolded.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a little resentment in her tone. This was still the first time that someone had spoken to her in this manner after all these years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finishing her words, Tang Bing turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Tang Bing, rest assured. With me around, no one can harm the reputation of our Nine Nether Palace.” Mu Chen said with a slight smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing lightly halted her steps as she snorted, “Speak with your performance. Otherwise, you can dream on getting a single drop of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid from me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, I’ll have to sincerely comply with the words of the Housekeeper.” Mu Chen smiled as he cupped his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing lightly cast her lips aside, no longer paying any attention to Mu Chen, and swiftly left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen turned around as well, looking at the stone stage belonging to the Blood Hawk Hall far away as a chill started to surge in his black pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since you guys want to play, then let us play.</span></p>
