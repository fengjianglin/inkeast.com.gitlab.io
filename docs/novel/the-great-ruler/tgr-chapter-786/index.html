They seemed like a scenery from a painting, which gave others a profound and cryptic feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>

In a blink of an eye, the two streaks of light had already disappeared from this horizon. Their speed had attracted the attention of those spread out in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven looking for treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But anyone could sense the powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations being emitted from those two light figures. Therefore, despite the fact that they had attracted so much attention, no one went to obstruct them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two figures were naturally Mu Chen and Cai Xiao, who were swiftly leaving after obtaining a Dragon-Phoenix Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But their objective wasn’t the four other Dragon-Phoenix Pools but the super Dragon-Phoenix Pool that Cai Xiao had found. According to what Cai Xiao had said, that super Dragon-Phoenix Pool was extremely dangerous, but Mu Chen had still chosen to make the trip with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How much longer?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As light flew, Mu Chen approached Cai Xiao as he transmitted his voice over to the latter with the wrapping of his Spiritual Energy. They had already been flying for half a day, this journey could be considered as far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Four more hours.” Cai Xiao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inwardly smacked his lips. He could sense that they have gradually gone very deep within the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, there wasn’t anyone in the forests here. Furthermore, the aura of beasts that appeared in these places had also increased in numbers and was more violent as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao suddenly stretched her hand out and held onto Mu Chen’s wrist. A chill and tender sensation came, before instantly, a rainbow light was emitted, forming into a barrier that enveloped the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will probably encounter more powerful beasts. Although you can store your Spiritual Energy into your body, I’m afraid that you will still be discovered. So I will be leading you.” Cai Xiao said as she cast a glance at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. It’s best if they could avoid those places. Otherwise, if they got entangled by those beasts, even if they managed to make it out of this place, their plan would definitely be affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the rainbow light enveloped the two of them, their speed swiftly burst out like a strand of light as they streaked across the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next four hours, Mu Chen had witnessed how dangerous this Dragon-Phoenix Haven was as the endlessly stretched ancient forest was filled with beasts with some massive and torrential ominous auras on some mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Mu Chen had sensed quite a few scanning fluctuations across the horizon. They were so much so that they even scanned them back and forth. They were the terrifying perceptions of some shocking beasts. Those that were scanning were extremely profound. If it wasn’t for Cai Xiao, and Mu Chen was alone, it would be hard for him to avoid these Spiritual Energy obstructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ancient land was clearly not a kind land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the way was covered with beasts layer upon layer, it was still a daunting experience without mishap. After four hours, Cai Xiao had also gradually slowed down her speed. They could be considered as having stepped into the core position of this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon entering the core, Mu Chen’s gaze had clearly turned more grave. He could sense an ancient pressure undulating in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That pressure made the airflow in this region become slow, even the Spiritual Energy had become heavy. This region was no longer the same as the other regions, the forests and hills were extremely small. That was because of the primordial pressure enveloping this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like we’re not in the wrong place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao chuckled as she looked at this land. To be able to have such pure remnant ancient pressure left behind in this region, looks like it was indeed a super Dragon-Phoenix Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But there doesn’t seem to be any beasts here…” Mu Chen tightly knitted his brows. He realised that this region was abnormally quiet. Furthermore, he did not feel any Spiritual Energy fluctuations belonging to beasts. This region was like a dead land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because no beasts dare to come here.” Cai Xiao nodded her head as she pointed her slender figure towards the depths. “Let’s go, the Dragon-Phoenix Pool should be deep inside. Be careful, this place is not simple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head and the two of them flew out. However, his body tensed up at this moment, Spiritual Energy was surging around him. Clearly, he was prepared to face any unexpected situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what made the two of them feel a little unexpected was that when they reached the depths, they did not encounter any obstructions. Thereafter, they leapt across a lone peak before them, before the area in front of them suddenly widened. The two’s pupils suddenly narrowed at this spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before them was a cracked ground with an abyssal hole in that location. That blackness made it seem bottomless, like a black hole that belonged to a sinister demon, making others feel their scalps numbing upon looking at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, what made the two of them more shocked wasn’t that black rolling hole, but the two colossi that floated above the hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two colossi were white with strands of dark-gold mixed within. Vaguely, there was a sinister aura being emitted from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the dragon and phoenix heads!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two massive dragon and phoenix heads that seemed to be even larger than a hill were biting onto one another. That brutality still transmitted over despite the two have turned into white bones after the myriad of years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inhaled a mouthful of air as he watched this scene with shock and muttered, “They really are the heads of a True Dragon and Phoenix…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bones that formed the Dragon-Phoenix Pool in the White Bones Mountain were like the distance between a firefly and vast moon compared to those before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there was still some distance with those dragon and phoenix heads, that incomparable domineering pressure was like a storm that swept out, causing Mu Chen’s breathing to be a little sluggish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao stared at the dragon head, before her figure moved, flying towards it with Mu Chen immediately following up after seeing her actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two swiftly approached the dragon and phoenix heads that were floating above the pitch-black hole. As they approached, they could clearly sense the shock in their vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the brutal aura of the dragon and phoenix biting each other, one could imagine just how stunning the fight between the True Dragon and Phoenix in the primordial times was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was two terrifying existences comparable to Heavenly Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where’s the Dragon-Phoenix Pool?” Mu Chen swept his gaze as he searched for their objective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao stretched her slim hand out and pointed towards the point where the dragon and phoenix were biting each other. At the point of contact between the two colossi, a bone pool could be vaguely seen. However, the pool wasn’t empty but filled with golden pool water. As the pool water rolled, there were actually dragon and phoenix runes surging, which were vaguely emitting clear draconic roars and phoenix cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dense and undissolvable scent was slowly spreading out. Smelling that scent, Mu Chen even felt his blood stirring. It was so much so that there was even a golden light on the surface of his body. The Ezsat Dragon Physique that he had refined was actually uncontrollably stirred at this moment.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Dragon-Phoenix Pool is not the best thing here.” Cai Xiao suddenly said as she looked beyond the Dragon-Phoenix Pool. Judging from the location, it was the point where the dragon and phoenix’s teeth sunk into each other from when they deeply bit one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked over and his gaze froze. Over there, a golden light surged. There was a huge golden sapling that grew out from the True Dragon and Phoenix bones. Although it was a small sapling, it was like a young dragon that was extremely firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this golden sapling, he could see three lumps of golden light. Looking through the golden lights, there were three golden fruits. The golden fruits looked extremely miraculous, with the appearance of a dragon and phoenix intertwining. As they intertwined, they formed into a wondrous dragon-phoenix fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, only two out of the three dragon-phoenix fruits were ripe, the third one seemed to have only started to recently grow. Therefore, it was extremely underripe. The miraculous fluctuations rippling from it was also far in comparison to the other two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even so, the third dragon-phoenix fruit could be considered as a peerless treasure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze blazed as he looked at the three fruits. He could sense that these three fruits were the best treasures in this land, since they contained the essence of the True Dragon and Phoenix heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to them, even this super Dragon-Phoenix Pool was inferior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those are the Divine Dragon-Phoenix Fruits. Born only from the perfect fusion of the True Dragon and Phoenix’s Blood Essences.” Cai Xiao lightly smiled. Looking at this level of treasure, there was pleasant surprise rippling in her eyes, even with her composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen licked his lips. Just when he was about to go up, his gaze suddenly narrowed as he looked at the Dragon-Phoenix Pool. The golden pool of water fluctuated at this moment and a pillar of water soared up. The pillar of water was torn apart and a golden figure flew out, tearing through space as he aimed to suppress Mu Chen with a palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under that palm, there was a roaring draconic image that suppressed the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under that terrifying pressure, which was comparable to Mt. Thai, Mu Chen’s face uncontrollably changed. Before he could even act, Cai Xiao had taken a step forth and a rainbow-coloured Spiritual Energy burst out. Her slender hand swiftly flew out like a bolt of lightning and clashed with that golden palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two palms of different sizes clashed, which instantly caused space to distort with visible fluctuations rippling out that frantically wreaked havoc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the havoc from the impact, Cai Xiao’s figure lightly shivered and took more than ten steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at this scene, Mu Chen’s gaze suddenly turned cold. This was the first time he had seen Cai Xiao at a disadvantage. It looked like they had encountered a truly ruthless figure this time.</span></p>
