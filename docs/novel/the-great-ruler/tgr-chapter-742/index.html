 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just three moves, the match ended with the Asura King’s defeat with heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Asura King retreated with heavy injuries, the region instantly froze. Not only were the experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain dumbfounded, but even the Hundred Battles Domain’s faction also wore expressions of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the outcome of the battle had far surpassed their expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was the Asura King’s reputation resounding in the Great Havenlaw Domain, it was the same for the Hundred Battles Domain. Although the Spiritual Corpse King was abnormal, everyone thought that the battle between them would be even more intense than the one between the Sleeping Emperor and the Devil Compassion Sovereign…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the outcome made everyone dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is it like this…?” Tang Bing’s face was pale as she looked at the Asura King, who had returned with grave injuries, and couldn’t help muttering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen also had an expression of disbelief as he looked at the sky. His gaze was fixed on the figure that was covered in black bandages and the abnormally eerie fluctuations emanating from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Asura King fought with the Spiritual Corpse King, their cultivations were completely revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seventh Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Be it the Asura King or the Spiritual Corpse King, both of their strengths had reached the height of Seventh Grade Sovereign. Within the two factions, the two of them were clearly the strongest amongst the King-levels. It was so much so that their strengths were comparable to Emperor-level experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, when both experts were at Seventh Grade Sovereign, there would be a deadlock in their battle. If there wasn’t any special cards from them, there was a chance that the match might end in a tie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when everyone harboured that thought, an unforeseen event happened in the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone saw the both of them exchange one or two moves, the Spiritual Corpse King suddenly retreated and with a wave or his hand, a black dried-up corpse appeared beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpse was practically a bag of bones, covered in strange black runes. Faintly, there were uncomfortable eerie fluctuations emanating from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the unique technique of the Demonic Corpse Sect, the Demon Corpse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Experts of the Demonic Corpse Sect had the special ability to nurture corpses that could be controlled by them, and use them in battle. So, generally speaking, the experts of the Demonic Corpse Sect excelled in using the power of the Demon Corpse to fight with the advantage of numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So everyone could tell that the black Demon Corpse was the Life Bond Demon Corpse of the Spiritual Corpse King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Spiritual Corpse King summoned his Life Bond Demon Corpse, the black bandages on him shattered as they broke off from his body. A great amount of blood and flesh also separated from his body and stuck onto the Life Bond Demon Corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a blood-reeking and sinister scene that would cause the hair on one’s body to stand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the great amount of blood and flesh separated itself from the Spiritual Corpse King and fused with his Life Bond Demon Corpse, the Life Bond Demon Corpse charged towards the Asura King with a wave of a hand. Thereafter… it immediately exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speaking from a certain extent, after absorbing the blood and flesh of the Spiritual Corpse King, the strength of it was also at Seventh Grade Sovereign as well. When it frantically exploded, that power was something that even experts at the level of Sky Vulture Emperor could only avoid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Life Bond Demon Corpse exploded, the Asura King had to exert all his means to defend, but still ended up with a loss and heavy injuries!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The outcome came too sudden. It was so much so that many people could not react in time. Everyone was dumbfounded. They couldn’t imagine the Spiritual Corpse King being so crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Life Bond Demon Corpse was greatly linked with his body. Although he would not die from the explosion of his Life Bond Demon Corpse, the Spiritual Corpse King would suffer unimaginably great injuries. Furthermore, it was tough to cultivate a Life Bond Demon Corpse. Now that the Spiritual Corpse King had exploded it, although he had obtained a victory, it was not worth the loss in the long term.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, everyone was dumbfounded by the Spiritual Corpse King’s insane actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of victory was too pricey…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Haaaa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen deeply inhaled a mouthful of chilled air as he looked at the silhouette of the Spiritual Corpse King. Under the latter’s black bandages, fresh blood was constantly flowing and dripping down. The Spiritual Energy fluctuations around him had also withered to a great extent. Evidently, exploding his Life Bond Demon Corpse had landed him with grave injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor flew out and grabbed ahold of the Asura King’s greatly injured body. His gaze was cold as he looked at the Spiritual Corpse King, “What a ruthless method. Aren’t you afraid that the price you are paying is too great?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Corpse King, who was wrapped under the black bandages, revealed an eerie gaze as he coldly laughed. With a wave of his hand, a humanoid doll that was framed from bones appeared. However, that humanoid doll was filled with cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Corpse Bone Doll?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Sky Vulture Emperor saw it, his face slightly changed. The Corpse Bone Doll was a very evil object. It was said that it could bear the fatal injuries of someone as a replacement. But the method for refining such an object was very bloody. Therefore, there were only a few that could use it. But, who could have thought that the Spiritual Corpse King would possess such a treasure? With the Corpse Bone Doll enduring the fatal injuries for him, he wouldn’t suffer much of the after effects of exploding Demon Corpse. It’s no wonder why he dared to act so insane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Spiritual Pupils Emperor, Nine Nether and the rest saw the Corpse Bone Doll, their faces turned terribly ugly. Clearly, the Spiritual Corpse King came well-prepared. It was no wonder why the Hundred Battles Domain would choose such a way to fight…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for the Sleeping Emperor being so deep and unfathomable and getting the first victory, their Great Havenlaw Domain would have lost right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, so our Hundred Battles Domain wins this round.” The Sword Concealing Elder said with a smile as his eyes narrowed. But in the eyes of the Great Havenlaw Domain faction, his smile was extremely hateful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor’s gaze was cold as he brought the Asura King, who had fainted, back and left him under the care of someone. His gaze was directed at the Great Havenlaw Ruler, who was still firmly seated on the throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ho, a win and loss…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light around the Great Havenlaw Ruler faintly trembled as a faint laughter rang out. However, there was a trace of a chill in that laughter. “Looks like your Hundred Battles Domain is well-prepared.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, those words are wrong, Great Havenlaw Ruler. The strength of the Hundred Battles Domain is weaker than the Great Havenlaw Domain to begin with, so they are only giving it their all.” Liu Tiandao, who had not spoken, lightly smiled out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only with such an expert at the Earth Sovereign Realm like Liu Tiandao standing there, could the threat of the Great Havenlaw Ruler towards the Sword Concealing Elder and the rest be decreased. Thus, he smiled, “Great Havenlaw Ruler, now that two of the battles have taken place, we are currently in a tie right now… If the Great Havenlaw Ruler can withdraw now, we can save the third battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A win and loss made the third battle to be unexpectedly important. The third person that represented the Hundred Battles Domain was the most low-profiled amongst the Domain Lords of the Hundred Battles Domain. But his strength was something that caused even Ling Qingfeng and those similar to sigh in admiration. It was so much so that there were many people stating that with Qin Bei’s capabilities, even amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region, he was definitely not amongst the ordinaries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whereas in the Great Havenlaw Domain, it was a Commander with the cultivation of Second Grade Sovereign. Although he had some reputation, it was incomparable to Qin Bei. So towards the third battle, the Hundred Battles Domain had great confidence about it. After all, no matter how bad it was, as long as Qin Bei wasn’t defeated, then this fight could be considered as their victory. Because the Great Havenlaw Domain had come full force at them, and to begin with, the reputation of the Great Havenlaw Domain was higher than them. If local powers like them were to end the fight like this, the Great Havenlaw Domain would probably become the laughing stock of the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless experts exchanged looks in the Great Havenlaw Domain faction. They couldn’t help directing their gazes towards the young man standing before the Nine Nether Troop with helplessness filling their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They originally thought that if they could obtain the first two victories, the third battle wouldn’t be important. But who could have thought that the situation would turn out like this…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The initially unimportant battle had become the most crucial battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The changes were ungraspable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the countless helpless gazes, Mu Chen only shrugged his shoulders and looked at the Great Havenlaw Ruler. Right now, it depended on the Great Havenlaw Ruler if he was to fight this match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes that were directed at Mu Chen shifted onto the Great Havenlaw Ruler as well. Under the countless gazes, the Great Havenlaw Ruler laughed as if it wasn’t unexpected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like things went as I have expected.” The Great Havenlaw Ruler faintly laughed, which caused the countless gazes from the Great Havenlaw Domain faction to freeze. What did that mean? Could it be that the Great Havenlaw Ruler had expected such a situation? Then why would he let Mu Chen have the most important battle? Was he so confident of the latter?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Havenlaw Ruler directed his gaze at Mu Chen and, with an ethereal voice, said, “Are you confident about this third battle that concerns the reputation of my Great Havenlaw Domain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen will do his best.”</span></p>

It looked like the Great Havenlaw Ruler had no intention to change his mind.
