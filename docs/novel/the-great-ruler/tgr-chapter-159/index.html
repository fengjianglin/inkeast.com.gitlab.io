 <p><b>Chapter 159 – Storming into the Spirit Ranking</b></p>
 <p><span style>Rampaging Spiritual energy rumbled within Mu Chen’s aura sea, as excitement filled the Nine Netherbird’s eyes. Even Mu Chen could clearly feel the emotions that it had currently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be impatient…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen smiled wryly and said: “Since I’ve promised that I would help you obtain the Northern Sea Dragon’s Blood Essence, I will definitely do it. But let’s be realistic as well, okay? After all, you’re not going to tell me to go and steal it, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Mu Chen’s voice, the Nine Netherbird’s eyes calmed down for a bit. The raging black flames on it body slowly weakened as it flapped its wings and said: “You must help me obtain it. Right now, I only require that to awaken my bloodline, break through the shackles of a Spiritual Beast, and complete my evolution.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen nodded his head and smiled: “Relax. Since we’ve formed a Bloodline Bond, I will definitely help you out to the best of my abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he stared once again at the price of the Northern Sea Dragon’s Blood Essence and shook his head as he smiled bitterly. Just how long would it take before he gathers a total of 7,000,000 Spiritual Value Points?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after he thought about it, he understood the reason behind it. After all, just how valuable is the Northern Sea Dragon’s Blood Essence? If it could be obtained easily, then it would be too good to be true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To obtain something like this, they could only take it step by step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Knock Knock!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, gentle knocks rang out near the door side. Mu Chen lifted his head and noticed a girl in a black dress leaning gently on the door. The girl’s figure was extremely slim and soft, and her waist had curves that would move any man. Her long hair flowed down like a silver river. At the same time, sunlight was shining through the windows and made the girl’s exquisite appearance even more beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen stared at the enchanting girl in front of him and was completely loss in his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at?” Luo Li walked in front of him and asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am quite fortunate that I suddenly became soft-hearted when I first met you in the Spiritual Road.” Mu Chen smiled. His black eyes stared at the exquisite face in front of him and said: “Otherwise, just how lonely would I be in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From what you’ve said, it seems that you didn’t really want to save me in the beginning?” A hint of smile and gentleness also appeared in Luo Li’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen was completely speechless. After all, it wouldn’t have been very beneficial for a person to be soft-hearted within a ruthless place like the Spiritual Road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You chased me for more than half a month right after that. You should have calmed down already, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Li smiled faintly. A gentle smile rippled within her calm eyes. Mu Chen was fortunate, but wasn’t she also fortunate? Because of his appearance, her gloomy world had seemed to come alive. Even if she had numerous burdens on her shoulders, she still possessed a bit of expectation on meeting him once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. Let’s stop with the chitchat and talk about business.” Luo Li retracted her smile and looked seriously at Mu Chen. She said: “You are planning to fight against Yang Hong in the freshmen competition a month later, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen nodded his head. He did not like Yang Hong at all. That guy was an accomplice of Ji Xuan on the Spiritual Road. All the events that were caused by Ji Xuan, this guy had also participated in them. Now that they’ve met in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, there was no way that he would &nbsp;let him go so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not that easy to deal with Yang Hong. Right now, he is also at the Heavenly Fusion Stage Initial Phase. However, he possessed the Earth Level Spiritual Pulse. Once he activates it, there aren’t many individuals that could compete against him at the Heavenly Fusion Stage.” Luo Li responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, based on what I’ve heard, Yang Hong had once obtained the Soul Essence of the Ancient Tigerdragon. Thus, his combat abilities would have soared even more. If he were to fight with everything he’s got, he would be able to fight against a Heavenly Fusion Stage Middle Phase.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Heaven Rank Middle Class Spiritual Beast, Ancient Tigerdragon, that’s ranked 50</span><span style>th</span><span style> on Myriad Beast Record’s Earth Ranking?” Mu Chen was quite surprised, and his expression turned serious. As expected, Yang Hong wasn’t an ordinary individual. With such combat abilities, even Mu Chen felt a bit of pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Mu Chen’s current strength, he would be able to fight against an Heavenly Fusion Stage Initial Phase opponent if he used the shared power of the Nine Netherbird. However, it would barely be enough against a Heavenly Fusion Stage Middle Phase opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he completely relies on the Nine Netherbird’s power, it would be a simple task for him to defeat a Heavenly Fusion Stage Middle Phase opponent. However, that was his last resort. Mu Chen did not want to borrow too much external power. Even if he formed a Bloodline Bond with the Nine Netherbird, it wasn’t beneficial for his cultivation if he borrowed too much external strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although you have many techniques, your foundation is still weak. After all, you are still only at the Spirit Stage Middle Phase. The gap between you and Yang Hong is exceptionally great. Therefore, you will have to make a lot of preparations for the battle next month. At the very least, you will have to increase your strength to the Spirit Stage Late Phase within the month,” Luo Li said with a solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen nodded his head. Although his combat abilities were equivalent to a Heavenly Fusion Stage Initial Phase, he was only still at the Spirit Stage Middle Phase. This was his major weakness. But at the same time, it wasn’t easy for him to advance to the Spirit Stage Late Phase within a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to advance to the Spirit Stage Late Phase in a month, it isn’t impossible. You would just have to rely on a bit of help.” Luo Li smiled slightly. Then her Spiritual Value Card emerged in her hand. The card then shone with light that displayed an item catalogue. Assorted items reappeared on the screen as Luo Li scrolled down with her slender hand. Finally, she stopped at a certain spot and there were a few characters of light written there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen immediately glanced over towards the text.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit Pill. A Pill that is beneficial to individuals at the Spirit Stage. It can help them advance to the next level. However, the medical energy within the Pill is extremely violent. If it isn’t completely ingested, it would harm the Spiritual Energy within one’s body. Price : 20,000 Spiritual Value Points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are able to obtain a Spirit Pill, you should be able to advance to the Spirit Stage Late Phase within a month. As for the violent medical energy, it is simple to deal with it. Instructor Mu Ling had mentioned it earlier, the Lightning Territory has endless amounts of divine lightning. The divine lightning possesses the effect of strengthening Spiritual Energy. If you were to take the Spirit Pill within that place, you should be able to rely on the power of the divine lightning to completely absorb the energy within the pill.” Luo Li smiled. Judging from her detailed explanation, it was evident that she had considered this issue a while ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen nodded his head. To a person like him who was at the Spirit Stage, the effect of this Spirit Pill was quite decent. It was quite rare to obtain such a precious pill within the Northern Spiritual Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, there is only one issue.” Luo Li pointed at the end of the light screen and said: “The Spirit Pill costs 20,000 Spiritual Value Points. Right now, I only have 11,000 Spiritual Value Points while you only have roughly 4,000 Spiritual Value Points. Even if we add it up, it wouldn’t be enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Li frowned. It was evident that she didn’t know what to do either. Since they’ve only just entered the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, they naturally did not possess many methods of earning Spiritual Value Points. Therefore, it was indeed an enormous problem to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spiritual Value Points, huh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen frowned for a moment before he smiled: “It’s not that there isn’t a solution to this issue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Luo Li stared in surprise at Mu Chen. She did not know what methods he could use to solve this issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen smiled and grabbed onto Luo Li’s slender hand: “Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that this guy started becoming all touchy again, Luo Li immediately blushed. She struggled gently for a moment before discovering that Mu Chen was holding &nbsp;her hand so tightly that she could only give up on resisting. After all, there was no one else aside from them here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen pulled Luo Li to the highest part of the house. There, they were able to see the clear blue skies. If they were to look further away, they would be able to see a corner of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Mu Chen stared at the most eye-catching bird-shaped mountain within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Accurately speaking, he was looking at the massive stone tablet that displayed the Spirit Ranking on top of the bird-shaped mountain’s left wing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t Instructor Mu Ling say it earlier? As long as we are able to enter the top ranks of the Spirit Stage, we would be able to obtain Spiritual Value Points as reward.” Mu Chen stared at the stone tablet that was a symbol of glory within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Numerous Northern Heaven Spiritual Academy students would probably always be checking to see if there were any changes on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you planning to enter the Spirit Ranking?” Luo Li said in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is indeed one method. With your current strength, you should be able to enter the top 10 ranks within the Spirit Ranking. But if you do this, you will offend the senior that had occupied that rank.” Luo Li replied. Right now, she had already advanced to the Heavenly Fusion Stage and had lost the qualifications to enter the Spirit Stage. Moreover, with her current strength, she didn’t have the ability to enter the higher ranking, Heavenly Ranking. Thus, she could not benefit from either rankings currently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That place was originally a place for new students only. They are already unreasonable by occupying those ranks in the first place. Moreover, it isn’t my style to hide.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen smiled. The competition within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was quite fierce. It didn’t matter whether it was be now or in the future, there would be an endless amount of competitions. If he were to always hide and hold back, just what purpose would it serve?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not come to the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to learn how to hide from troubles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re truly quite a troublemaker. You haven’t even entered the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy for a day, yet you are planning to do such a thing.” Luo Li smiled as she replied helplessly. She could already foresee the commotion that would be caused by this event. This isn’t simply an issue about rankings. Instead, it would be a challenge issued to the seniors by the freshmen. This is because during the past few years, there were no freshmen that dared to drag a senior down from the Spirit Ranking when they had just arrived in the academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was also forced to do this. The two of us would be bankrupt after purchasing the Spirit Pill. Compared to this, who would care about the prestige of a senior?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen smiled and clenched his hand tightly. The Spiritual Value Card emerged in front of him as faint lights emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen stared at the Spiritual Value Card and his eyes turned serious. He slowly tightened his hands and a powerful Spiritual Energy surged out from his body. The surrounding air also began to fluctuate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within his aura sea, the Spiritual Energy light wheel flashed. The Spirit that was sitting cross-legged on top of the light wheel also emitted dazzling light as it pushed the Spiritual Energy in his body to the limits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark-black Spiritual Energy rushed out from Mu Chen’s fist and caused a tremendous pounding sound. It roared as it formed a pillar of light and bombarded the flashing Spiritual Value Card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A deep sound resounded within the freshmen area. A beam of light immediately rushed up into the sky. At this moment, the freshmen within this area all lifted their heads, bewildered as they stared at the beam of light. Then, they discovered that the beam of light rushed through the sky and headed to the giant stone tablet that symbolizes the glory of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
