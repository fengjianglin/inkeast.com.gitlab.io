 <p><strong>Chapter 423 - Old Ancestor Wu Liang</strong></p>
 <p>Within the top of the clouds, where it’s hard for the naked-eye to see, a black figure flew across the Northern Heavens Continent at lightning speed. When it spread its wings, it appeared to have pierced through space. Therefore, it made it simply impossible to get a clear image of its entire body. One would only see a black figure shooting through space, appearing thousands of metres away in a blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>Such a speed caused all of the ordinary Sovereigns to look on with dumbstruck shock, as it was one that would completely leave them in the dust, with no hope of ever catching up.</p>
 <p>The black figure was, naturally, the Northern Dragon who had stormed out of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Although the Northern Heavens Continent was vast and endless, wanting to rush over to the Divine Spiritual Mountain was just a matter of a dozen minutes with his true speed.</p>
 <p>The gigantic black figure shot through the space at lightning speed. In the next instant, the space before him shattered apart as black-coloured sea water covered the earth and hid the skies as it swept out from within. From within the shattered space, a seemingly endless gigantic black bird howled out from within.</p>
 <p>Scree!</p>
 <p>This unforeseen change causing the Northern Dragon to feel a slight shock. In the next instant, its cloud-covering wings flashed forwards, sending its feathers, which were akin to incomparably sharp Divine Weapons, tearing through space, smashing against the water of the black sea.</p>
 <p>Bang! Rumble!</p>
 <p>Ripples that blotted the skies swept out as multiple spaces shattered apart. Instantly, tornados thousands of metres wide whirled up above the nine heavens.</p>
 <p>“Which little rascal is it!? Come the hell out for me!”</p>
 <p>Rays of brilliance erupted around the gigantic black figure before rapidly shrinking down. Transforming back to a human form, the Northern Dragon looked towards the space before him as his cold roar resounded across the horizon.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Long time no see, Northern Dragon. Your temper’s still as explosive as ever.” A laughing voice rang out from within the space as the multiple spatial tears rapidly collapsed, while boundless black-coloured sea water gushed out. Rapidly covering the entire region, it appeared as if there were black-coloured tidals waves present within the layers of clouds in the air.</p>
 <p>A pillar of water condensed within the sea water, before a figure appeared within it.</p>
 <p>The figure present was of an old man dressed in blue robes. Black water patterns were painted on the blue robes, and they sparkled with faint rays of brilliance. At this moment, the blue-robed old man was beaming as he looked towards the Northern Dragon present before him.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the blue-robed old man, the eyes of Northern Dragon slightly contracted, before speaking out in a deep voice, “Old Ancestor Wu Liang? Aren’t you exacting tyrannical abuse to the Immeasurable Continent? What have you run to the Northern Heavens Continent for?”</p>
 <p>The blue-robed old man was known as the Immeasurable Old Ancestor. It’s said that this person was a Ninth Grade Sovereign and controlled a continent more vast and boundless than the Northern Heavens Continent, the Immeasurable Continent. Similarly, there were a few other smaller continents that were also under his control. Therefore, he was considered as an Overlord-level existence within the Great Thousands Worlds, someone that possessed fame and reputation.</p>
 <p>However, there was some distance between the Immeasurable Continent and the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Why did the Immeasurable Old Ancestor appear all of a sudden?</p>
 <p>“Haha. Long time no see, old friend. The reason I’ve come here is to reminisce the old days,” said the Immeasurable Old Ancestor with a beaming smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Staring towards the Immeasurable Old Ancestor, a chilling glow surfaced within the eyes of the Northern Dragon as he spoke out in a slow fashion, “So, it was the Demonic Dragon Palace that has invited you. I knew it. Why would those bastards get the guts to challenge our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy all of a sudden? So it was you, old fellow, that’s pulling the strings in the dark.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, the Immeasurable Old Ancestor gave a smile as he replied, “I’ve long heard that there is a Divine Spiritual Mountain in the Northern Heavens Continent. This old man’s quite interest in it. Northern Dragon, after all these years in the Northern Heavens Continent, you’ve actually not maintained a complete control over it! Why not, let’s partner up and rule over this entire continent? At that time, we can cooperate and search that Divine Spiritual Mountain. I don’t believe that you wouldn’t get moved by the place where a Heavenly Sovereign has passed away in a sitting position.”</p>
 <p>The Northern Dragon replied indifferently. “Old Ghost Immeasurable, it’s best that you scram back to your Immeasurable Continent. Don’t poke your nose in the matters of the Northern Heavens Continent.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the Northern Dragon’s reply, which was gradually getting impolite, the smile present on the Immeasurable Old Ancestor’s face started to fade as he said, “Northern Dragon, aren’t you not going to give this humble old man some face at all?”</p>
 <p>A ridiculing smile instantly surfaced on the face of the Northern Dragon as he stared at the Immeasurable Old Ancestor, while replying, “Don’t try to show your might off in front of me, old ghost. I’m afraid that you’ve found the wrong person to do that. You, humble? When the Martial Ancestor had just entered the Great Thousand World, you, old ghost, had attempted to dip your fingers into his women after finding how attractive they were. As a result, you were almost smashed to death by a single slap from him. You’ve shamelessly fled for a year, not even daring to return to your old den at that year. Do you think your shameless self has any such thing as a thin skin? If you have the guts, you can just scram off and go to find the Martial Ancestor in the “Martial Realm”. If you’re able to return alive, I’ll let you trample all over the Northern Heavens Continent as you wish!”</p>
 <p>Those words from the Northern Dragon were as incisive as knives, instantly causing the smile present on the face of the Immeasurable Old Ancestor to slowly freeze up. Terrifying murderous aura surged up into the heavens, spreading across the myriad horizon.</p>
 <p>“You’re looking to die, Northern Dragon!”</p>
 <p>The Immeasurable Old Ancestor’s face turned flushed as he roared out. This matter had always been a thorn in his heart. Due to an obsession that occurred that year, he was made a gargantuan laughing stock, which had caused his fame and reputation to plummet and had become the embarrassment in his heart. All these years, he had crazily trained, leading to a drastic increase in his strength. Previously, he had even thought about exacting revenge. However, he never imagined that when his strength increased, that “Martial Ancestor” had rapidly scaled the realms in his cultivation, leading him to rise from a nobody to an Overlord within the Great Thousand World. His subordinating “Martial Realm” had numerous experts akin to clouds in the skies, with a clan that had a background as long as the Ice Spirit Clan willingly giving in to him. Even the position of their clan leader was handed to a wife of the “Martial Ancestor”. It was the combination of the Martial Ancestor and the Martial Realm that allowed the death-filled “Ice Spirit Clan” to gradually become the tyrannical force it was today.</p>
 <p>Faced against such a frightening existence, the Immeasurable Old Ancestor had lived all those years in fear and trepidation, afraid that the “Martial Realm” would send experts to deal with him. Therefore, let’s not talk about avenging his embarrassment, he didn’t even dare to recklessly get close to that “Martial Realm”.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, murderous aura surged from the Immeasurable Old Ancestor as black-coloured tidal waves that blotted the skies instantly swept forward. Each and every drop within those tidal waves was water from the “nether river” founded from the netherworld, nurtured with his boundless Spiritual Energy, before forming his Nether Sea. Wherever his sea howled towards, it would spread over thousands and thousands of meters, transforming anything that came into contact with it into nihility, appearing incomparably overbearing.</p>
 <p>Hmph!</p>
 <p>Seeing the Immeasurable Old Ancestor take action, a cold snort rang out from the Northern Dragon. A withered palm extended out, transforming into a feathered wing thousands of metres long. With a wave of its feathers, feathery glints covered the earth and hid the skies as they explosively shot out, Piercing through space, they heavily smashed against the incoming black tidal waves.</p>
 <p>The black sea crazily gushed and surged. Despite that, it was unable to break the obstruction caused by the feathery glints. The overbearing sea was also unable to corrode the tyrannical feathery glints smashing into it.</p>
 <p>“Are you really going to use this method against me? You, old ghost, really have become senile!”</p>
 <p>With a frosty expression present on his face, the Northern Dragon gave a wave of his sleeve, causing the countless feathery glints to quickly condense together. Transforming into a fish-and-dragon-like creature, it smashed straight towards the black tidal waves, shattering through them, before shooting towards the Immeasurable Old Ancestor with incomparable force.</p>
 <p>Originally being an existence that lived within the unending Northern Sea. Although the Immeasurable Old Ancestor’s Nether Sea was overbearing, it was difficult for it to have much effect in the suppression of the former. Instead, relying on the force of the sea, he was able to erupt with a more powerful counter-attack.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Giving a stomp with his feet, giant waves that blotted the skies condensed together within the black sea. Transforming into a gigantic black trident thousands of metres long, it was thrust out in the next instant, ferociously shooting towards the the fish-dragon like giant creature.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Frightening shock waves swept out, spreading across thousands and thousands of metres across the horizon. The entire region started to rampage as crazy gales and hurricanes whirled up, causing chaos and disorder to wreak havoc across to the thousands and thousands of metres of the earth below, causing countless experts to flee for their lives, overwhelmed with shock.</p>
 <p>Outside of the Divine Spiritual Mountain</p>
 <p>Countless experts furiously raised their heads as they stared towards the far distance with shock in their eyes. Clearly, all of them could sense the earth-shattering fight that had erupted there. The fluctuations rippling out from there had caused even the hearts of a few Elders to tremble in fear and shock.</p>
 <p>“Who’s fighting over there? What’s with this frightening commotion?!”</p>
 <p>“It’s definitely that Lord Northern Dragon from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy!”</p>
 <p>“Who’s fighting with him? There’s actually someone that could contend against him?”</p>
 <p>“This…might be the handiwork of the Demonic Dragon Palace…”</p>
 <p>The eyes of some of the Elders started to fluctuate as they exchanged looks at each other, before turning to look at the Black Dragon Sovereign and his fellow Sovereigns in shock. <em>That’s why the Demonic Dragon Palace dared to take action against the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy! Looks like they’ve invited a frightening helper.</em></p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang had also felt the fluctuations radiating from there, which had caused his face to slightly change.</p>
 <p>“Haha. What’s the matter, Tai Cang? The Northern Dragon has been obstructed. Now, do you think that there’s still anyone that can save you?” The Black Dragon Sovereign started to heartily chuckle, his laughing brimming with carefree satisfaction. After being suppressed for all those years, their Demonic Dragon Palace had finally managed to regain the upper hand.</p>
 <p>“Your Demonic Dragon Palace really has paid quite a price to deal with our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy!” replied Dean Tai Cang with a sneer.</p>
 <p>He naturally knew about the current situation. Not only did the Demonic Dragon Palace invite such a powerful foreign aid like the Immeasurable Old Ancestor, he had even managed to move the Umbra and Heavenly Yuan Chambers of Commerce to obstruct the Elders of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. To do such matters, they would definitely need to pay a considerable price.</p>
 <p>“As long as we’re able to wipe away your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, no matter what the price, our Demonic Dragon Palace will pay any price!” replied the Black Demon Sovereign with a chilling smile.</p>
 <p>A frosty expression loomed over Dean Tai Cang’s gaze. <em>Looks like I’ve to go all-out today.</em></p>
 <p>“Everyone, this is a war between our Demonic Dragon Palace and the Northerns Spiritual Academy. I hope that no one else interferes in this.” Taking a look at his surroundings, the Black Dragon Sovereign roared out in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>The faces of the Elders from the various other influences slightly changed. Originally, they had imagined that the Demonic Dragon Palace was seeking their own deaths, since the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had an existence like the Northern Dragon behind them. However, from the looks of it now, the Demonic Dragon Palace had hatched this plan from a long, long time ago. As long as they were able to successfully encircle and kill Dean Tai Cang today, with the fame and prestige of the Immeasurable Old Ancestor, the ending of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy wouldn’t be encouraging.</p>
 <p>At this time, how would they dare to take action? It’s best that they maintained a neutral standing. If not, they might get a whole lot of trouble, if they were to choose the wrong side.</p>
 <p>“Form up and let’s move!”</p>
 <p>With a furious wave of his hand, six thousand-plus metre rays of light spread out from the Black Dragon Sovereign. Akin to a gigantic umbrella, they instantly enveloped the six people from the Demonic Dragon Palace with Dean Tai Cang within them.</p>
 <p>The killing formation had already been completed.</p>
 <p>A heaven-shaking war was inevitable!</p>
