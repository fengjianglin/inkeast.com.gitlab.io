 <p><strong>Chapter 602 - The Finals</strong></p>
 <p>When the eight teams made their appearance on the Golden Battle Stairs, deafening cheers resounded in this region. Whether or not it be the teams that represented their Spiritual Academy who made it into the Finals, they all held great expectations for the Final Battle that was about to begin.</p>
 <p>All in all, these eight teams before their eyes had risen above the countless Spiritual Academies. Thus, speaking from a certain degree, their strength represented the stronger fighting power amongst the academies.</p>
 <p>The Five Great Deans who were seated on the sky overlooked the Golden Battle Stairs, with the exception that every single one of them wore a different expression.</p>
 <p>A dense smile had long replaced the indifferent expression on Dean Tai Cang’s face as his heart was similarly engulfed in astonishment and surprise.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t surprised by the fact that Mu Chen’s team could make it to the Finals; he just never expected Mu Chen to achieve such a feat in the elimination round.</p>
 <p>“Haha, looks like there is a fresh talent emerging from your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy in this tournament as well, Dean Tai Cang.” Dean Wu of the Martial Spiritual Academy shot a glance at Mu Chen as he spoke with an eye-narrowing smile.</p>
 <p>“They are just lucky. That Wu Ling of your school doesn’t look simple, either. I’m guessing that they are trying to hide their strength and, thus, did not compete for the best 3. Am I right?” Dean Tai Cang responded with a smile as the joy between his brows leaked out. After all, it was years since their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy achieved such results.</p>
 <p>“From the looks of it, Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy seems to have improved.” Dean Tian Sheng, who was quiet this whole time, let out a faint smile at this moment as he continued, “Dean Tai Cang, I bid my congratulations to you.”</p>
 <p>The smile on Dean Tian Sheng’s face was indifferent with abstruse eyes; no one could tell what he was thinking. From the looks of it, he didn’t seem too affected by the fact that Ji Xuan wasn’t able to obtain the first place.</p>
 <p>“Dean Tian Sheng must be joking, it doesn’t mean anything since it was only the elimination round.” Although Dean Tian Sheng was an old fox, Dean Tai Cang wasn’t someone that's easy to mess with as well as he spoke with a smile. “But no matter how powerful the opponents are, my Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy will spare no effort.”</p>
 <p>“How expecting.”</p>
 <p>Dean Tian Sheng responded with a smile as he nodded his head. He shifted his gaze onto the three remaining Deans and spoke, “Since the best 8 are already here, shall we proceed to the Finals?”</p>
 <p>The three Deans nodded upon hearing his words.</p>
 <p>Looking at their response, Dean Tian Sheng stood up from his throne, which was made from light. In comparison to the vast heavens and earth, his silhouette was especially small. But not knowing why the instant he stood up, it felt like he was overlooking the heavens and earth, unleashing might which was beyond any ability to describe. Under that terrifying might, the cheers that were resounding in this region fell into silence in an instant as countless revered gazes were looking at him.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen, who stood at the top of the Golden Battle Stairs, was also looking at the white-robed figure with his head raised. The might that was emitted from him made his heart jolt and felt his mind sway. That’s the true power of experts, compared to that level, there was a huge gap between them. However, he wasn’t dismayed by that, because he knew that it was just a matter of time to temper himself to that level.</p>
 <p>“Firstly, I would like to congratulate those who managed to get into the Best 8. No matter what the outcome will be, you are already outstanding amongst all the Spiritual Academies.” Dean Tian Sheng’s voice was faint as it contained sound waves that caused a fine trembling between the heavens and earth; even the Spiritual Energy in everyone’s bodies was trembling along with it.</p>
 <p>“The elimination round has already come to an end, and now, we will soon start our Final Battle.”</p>
 <p>“Only the person who rises amongst the others in the Final Battle can be the strongest amongst the innumerable Spiritual Academies, he will represent the apex of all academies.”</p>
 <p>A multitude had their blood boiled as they heard his speech. The apex was a spot that held unreachable glory for them and right now, there were only eight teams that could fight it out for that glory.</p>
 <p>“Every single one in the Champion team will receive a thousand drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid and a Sovereign Elixir.”</p>
 <p>Whooooooosh.</p>
 <p>His words caused an uproar as many people had their eyes reddened. They were well aware what the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid represented. It was something that was indispensable to ascend the Sovereign Realm.</p>
 <p>Even for some Clans, a thousand drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was not a small amount.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the Sovereign Elixirs were extremely rare, since it was reported that only Sovereign Spiritual Liquid that had been refined to the limits could be formed into elixirs, having a price tag comparable to a Low Rank Divine Artifact</p>
 <p>Everyone was well aware that even if they did manage to get through the Third Grade Spirit Disaster, they still required the support of a huge amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. Not to mention that it wasn’t a hundred percent success rate. The moment they failed, the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid that they had stockpiled would all be for naught. Although a Sovereign Elixir still couldn’t guarantee an absolute success, it increased the success rate by several folds.</p>
 <p>The miracle effect was even more precious compared to a Divine Artifact for them who had not reached the Sovereign Realm.</p>
 <p>“Sovereign Elixir… what generosity.”</p>
 <p>Even Mu Chen exclaimed in admiration. Due to the fact that he had the Spiritual Condensing Bowl, although a thousand Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was still very attractive for him, it still was insufficient to leave him stunned to this level. But his heart was jolting when he heard the Sovereign Elixir.</p>
 <p>“It should be a reward pooled by the Five Great Spiritual Academies, making this tournament worthy of participating.” Luo Li smiled as she stood by his side. Although the Sovereign Elixir was extremely precious, it wasn’t to an extent to make her moved.</p>
 <p>“You’re the future Empress of the Luo God Clan. A fulfilled Empress has no idea how starved her husband is.” Mu Chen teased.</p>
 <p>Luo Li helplessly shot an enraged look at him, the flirtatious expression what was unintentionally revealed by her made the minds of others shake. Even those gazes gathered on her from outside the Golden Battle Stage lit up.</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen’s heart was also shaken by her expression, he sensed a cold gaze staring at him. Turning his head over, he saw Ji Xuan staring in his direction.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Ji Xuan’s face was covered with a layer of chill, no longer having the gentle expression he had in the past. Clearly, he had fallen into a pit this time. Originally, he thought that he already had Mu Chen stomped beneath him with that surge of 50,000 points at the last minute, but his contentment didn’t last long as he saw Mu Chen’s points soaring at a terrifying speed, surpassing him before he could firmly sit on the Numero Uno ranking.</p>
 <p>Within his raging and shaken heart, Ji Xuan’s pride was clearly broken. If it wasn’t for the strand of rationale that he held, he might have lost control and attacked one of the best 8 to seize their points…</p>
 <p>However, Mu Chen did not give him much time to plan as eight Academy Plaques amongst the Top 16 were already ignited when he surpassed Ji Xuan.</p>
 <p>Who would have thought that when Ji Xuan attempted to use his schemes on Mu Chen, he'd smash his own feet instead of with a rock when he chose to end the elimination round and determined his points.</p>
 <p>Although the ranking in the elimination round was completely unrelated from the contest over the Championship title, in the end, the feeling of being stepped on still filled Ji Xuan’s heart with rage.</p>
 <p>He had never suffered such a huge loss in his life, even his confrontation with Mu Chen in the Spiritual Road ended with him as the winner.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked at Ji Xuan’s cold gaze as he replied with a smile and cupped his hands, “Thanks for that.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Ji Xuan felt suffocation in his heart as his breathing became heavy, even the movements on his face lessened with his gaze turning colder.</p>
 <p>“It’s still a little early for you to be complacent.”</p>
 <p>Ji Xuan sneered, “Just hope you don’t encounter me in the first round. Otherwise, you might not even get into the Best 4.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll return your words unchanged.” Mu Chen smiled as an eerie light spun in his black pupils, “But rest assured, I will have a good fight with you this time.”</p>
 <p>“It seems like our previous fight gave you a little too much confidence.” The corner of Ji Xuan’s lips rose as he continued, “You have to be more careful. Otherwise, it will be painful when you fall with such high confidence.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t fall to your death.” Mu Chen shrugged.</p>
 <p>The exchange between the two was filled with chill, making the confrontation in their words obvious.</p>
 <p>Luo Li quietly stood beside Mu Chen as she shot an indifferent glance to Ji Xuan with her clear eyes. Although she did not speak, the supportive attitude she had of Mu Chen made the veins on Ji Xuan’s arm throb.</p>
 <p>“And now, we will draw lots to determine your opponent!”</p>
 <p>Dean Tian Sheng’s voice in the sky resonated once again. He waved his sleeve as eight light balls flew from his palm and hovered above the battle stage.</p>
 <p>“Pick for yourself. Inside the eight light balls, there are colors classified in pairs. Those who obtained the same color will be your opponent.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his voice, all those below raised their heads as the Captains of the eight teams made a suction gesture, pulling a light ball into their palms.</p>
 <p>The light ball hovered above Mu Chen’s hand, he gave Luo Li, Shen Cangsheng and the rest a glance as all of them lightly nodded their heads at him.</p>
 <p>Haaaaaaah.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen lightly breathed out a mouthful of white mist as his eyes turned sharp, he clenched his fist and caused the light ball to explode.</p>
 <p>As the light ball exploded, a pillar dyed in a scarlet red that looked like flames soared into the sky from his palm.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the remaining seven teams crushed their light balls and along with that, seven light pillars soared.</p>
 <p>All the gazes in this region were nervously directed at them.</p>
