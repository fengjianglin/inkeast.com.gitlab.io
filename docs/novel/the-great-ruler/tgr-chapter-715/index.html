 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the conference came to an end, the entire Great Havenlaw Domain was shaken because, they knew that the Great Havenlaw Domain that had been hibernating for so many years was about to reveal its fangs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The forces that had been provoking their Great Havenlaw Domain for all these years would soon understand how terrifying the revenge they would be facing was when the slumbering lion wakes up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Orders started to regularly spread throughout the Greatlaw Sky. Countless forces in the Great Havenlaw Domain had also started to move their troops as an undercurrent flowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would be a genuine war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether Palace</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Palace was covered in cheers today and every single member of the Nine Nether Palace had their faces filled with excitement. The resentment that they had been holding in for so many years had finally been released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From today onwards, no one in the Great Havenlaw Domain would look at their Nine Nether Palace in ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Palace was filled with a joyous atmosphere and everyone bumped their cups. The atmosphere was abnormally elated as laughter rang out in the entire Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the top of the hall, Mu Chen laid down as the bright moon hung in the sky. Listening to that laughter, a smear of a smile rose on the corner of his lips. Shortly after, he raised his head and looked at the bright moon, vaguely taking the form of a sweetly smiling figure before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen muttered to himself. Counting the time, it had been half a year since they were separated. He had no idea about the current situation in the Luo God Clan, but it shouldn’t be too easy, right? The heavy burden of the Luo God Clan was resting on Luo Li’s soft shoulders. Just thinking about it made Mu Chen feel a little heartache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he knew that the current him couldn’t provide any help to her. It was so much so that he could not go to where she was, since he would definitely bring some trouble for her. Although she might not mind it, his pride and arrogance as a man wouldn’t allow something like that to occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li, I am working hard to get stronger. But… believe me, there will be a day that I will become that supreme expert. At that time, I will not let you suffer the slightest grievance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly clenched his fist. A supreme expert, just those words alone held lots of weight. Perhaps others might laugh at him, but that girl believed him right from the start without any doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re thinking of your little lover again?” A faint voice abruptly rang out from Mu Chen’s rear. Turning his head over, he saw Nine Nether seated on the towering roof not knowing when her hair that draped down like a waterfall was gently fluttering in the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen awkwardly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether rested her cheeks on her hand as she gave Mu Chen a smile. The coldness on her face had entirely disappeared and was replaced with a rare gentle expression that seldom appears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s all thanks to you this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shook his head and smiled. “Since you have even placed the entire Nine Nether Palace into the bet, how can I not give it my all?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether stood up as she came to Mu Chen’s side, along with a fragrance drifted with the wind. She gently patted his shoulder. “Rest assured, since I was the one that brought you here from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, I will not let you be disappointed. Believe me, the day will come when your name resounds throughout the entire Skylaw Continent. At that time, you will be able to head for the Luo God Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And I will do all I can to aid you to that step. This is my promise to you.” Nine Nether smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the gorgeous beauty before him and felt a little touched in his heart. Thinking again, Nine Nether had given him quite a bit of help these years. Furthermore, she gave him her help when he was in dire situations. Although his intentions were ill when Nine Nether first invaded his body, it accidentally ended up in the Bloodlink Bond. The two of them also started to talk and right now, the relationship between them could not be separated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks.” Mu Chen said gently in a sincere tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether smiled as she waved her hand. “Okay, don’t get touched by everything. The relationship between us is concluded in the Bloodlink Bond. If you somehow get killed, wouldn’t that mean that I will also die with you, somehow? I don’t wish for that to happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly rolled his eyes at her. The good atmosphere was broken in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our Nine Nether Palace will also make a move on this Expedition War. The Hundred Battles Domain is chaotic, and not easy to deal with. But no matter what, you must reveal your outstanding talent in this war.” Nine Nether’s face turned a little serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze flashed, “It’s because of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether gravely nodded her head. “Don’t belittle the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. I have heard about it back in my clan. Whether it was the Divine Dragon or Divine Phoenix Baptism, it will be greatly beneficial to your future cultivation. This benefit isn’t something that the Greatlaw Goldpond can be compared to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only the most outstanding member from the younger generation can obtain the qualification to enter the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Your qualifications are still shallow. If you do not grab ahold of this Expedition War, it will be hard for you to obtain a qualification.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head and looked at Nine Nether. “You should also be in this qualification, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s main body was the Nine Netherworld Bird. If her age was judged in according to the Nine Nether Bird Clan, she had just grown to adulthood, so she was naturally considered as a younger generation, as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My body is that of a Divine Beast, so the Dragon-Phoenix Haven will not be of any great help to me.” Nine Nether smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen focused his gaze on her, but did not speak anything; he only looked down and gently nodded his head. It’s good enough for something to be remembered in his heart, there was no need to hang it by the lips. The things that Nine Nether had done for him wasn’t just this much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will work hard.” Mu Chen nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether stretched her hand out and a jade bottle appeared with a flash. In the transparent crystal jade bottle, there was a perfectly round dark-green pill quietly floating within. A pure fluctuation of elixir fragrance that felt pleasing to the heart was emitted from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Sovereign Elixir, it should be helpful to you. Naturally, this is also your spoils of war.” Nine Nether smiled. “I will distribute the remaining four. After all, it will not be beneficial for you if you take too much of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was a little curious as he received the jade bottle. He stared at the Sovereign Elixir and grinned. “The Blood Hawk King actually gave it away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There should’ve initially been some twists and turns. With the Blood Hawk King’s character, even if he were to give it out, he would drag this matter. But, fortunately, Lord Domain Ruler had spoken today, so he wouldn’t dare to act shamelessly, even if he had a hundred guts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether smiled as she said in puzzlement, “But Lord Domain Ruler doesn’t usually pay attention to such battles, so we were fortunate that he was for this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Domain Ruler’s identity, a battle at the level of the Nine Nether Troop and Blood Hawk Troop was like child's play. It was not possible for him to pay much attention to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen scratched his head. He wasn’t familiar with this Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain, so he could only shamelessly boast, “Maybe this Domain Ruler has a good opinion of my potential.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether rolled her eyes at the boasting Mu Chen and could not be bothered to speak with him anymore. She waved her hand and floated down towards the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Nine Nether’s leaving silhouette, Mu Chen lightly smiled and gripped the jade bottle even tighter, feeling elated in his heart. With the help of this Sovereign Elixir, he should be able to attempt to break through to Second Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A mere Sovereign Elixir made you so happy, you’re too much of a good-for-nothing.” A young, lazy and gentle voice suddenly rang out. Mu Chen immediately turned his head over saw Mandala, who was wearing a black dress and her long hair draped down. Her snow-white feet were gently tapping the sharp edge of the roof as she looked at him with a disdained expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re well-fed and do not know sufferings of a starved person.” Mu Chen cast his mouth to the side and immediately warned, “The Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain has come out from seclusion, it’s best if you be cautious and not be noticed by him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Domain Ruler was a powerful Earth Sovereign expert with terrifying perception. Although Mandala, who was before him, was very mysterious, it didn’t mean that she wouldn’t get noticed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mandala’s golden eyes slanted and drifted a glance at Mu Chen, then lightly said, “If I do not wish to be discovered, then no one will be able to discover me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, fine, you’re formidable.” Mu Chen was amused by her arrogant attitude and could only roll his eyes as he turned around and was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait.” Mandala suddenly spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?” Mu Chen curiously looked at the little girl whose dress was fluttering in the night wind as if she was about to be blown away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala gritted her teeth, and briefly hesitated to say, “The curse in my body will break out in three days. At that time, I will need the power of the Immortal Page that resides in your body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So soon?” Mu Chen was startled.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen pondered, then nodded his head in the end. He was curious as to why Mandala had to adjust her condition to the best, despite possessing such terrifying strength. Was she going to face a great danger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait till I suppress the curse. I will teach you how to cultivate the Great Solar Undying Body. Right now, you can’t even unleash its powers.” Mandala lightly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he looked at Mandala in excitement, it was a fatal temptation to him. Although the Great Solar Undying Body was powerful, it was too profound, and he only knew how to refine it. There wasn’t any information about how to exert its powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you know how to cultivate the Great Solar Undying Body?” Despite being joyful, Mu Chen involuntarily asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mandala did not bother with him. Her feet tapped the roof and she flew down the hall, disappearing into the night with a sentence left behind with a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will look for you three days from now.”</span></p>
