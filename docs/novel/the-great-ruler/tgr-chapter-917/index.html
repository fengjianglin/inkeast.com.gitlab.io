That person was naturally the Sky Vulture Emperor, one of the three Emperors of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, a low commotion rang out. Just what happened in the depths of the Fallen Battlefield, why would these pinnacle experts suddenly appear here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and the Kings saw the appearance of the Sky Vulture Emperor, they felt heavily relieved. With the Sky Vulture Emperor’s presence, it’s impossible for the Netherworld Palace to do anything to them anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The face of the Netherflame Oldman turned a little dark when he saw the appearance of the Sky Vulture Emperor and snorted, “You old bastard really are like a spirit that clings onto me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor smiled, before looking at the frozen Heavenly Evil King. “Okay, today’s matters can come to an end here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“End here?” Netherflame Oldman coldly responded, “Your Great Havenlaw Domain has caused a death of the only Battle Formation Master of my Netherworld Palace. You think that this matter can rest so easily?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wasn’t he killed by you.” The Sky Vulture Emperor smiled as he continued, “But seeing that you guys have lost a Battle Formation Master, then my Great Havenlaw Domain can overlook the 400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He appeared to be generous, giving up 400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets so easily. But the Sky Vulture Emperor was clear that it’s practically impossible for the Netherflame Oldman to hand over 400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets. Especially under the condition that the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury had been found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ferocious light surged in the eyes of the Netherflame Oldman as he coldly looked at Mu Chen. Being looked by the Netherflame Oldman, Mu Chen felt a surge of cold on his skin, as if he was being eyed at by a viper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had caused a slight change in Mu Chen’s expression because he knew the risk involved if an Eighth Grade Sovereign was determined to kill him. At that time, not even the Asura King would be able to protect him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor had also moved, capturing the Seventh Grade Sovereign, the Heavenly Evil King. Although there was a factor of a sneak attack involved, it had also clearly displayed the gap between Seventh and Eighth Grade Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Netherflame, I suggest you stow that idea of yours away. Because the moment you make a move, I will immediately kill the Heavenly Evil King as well.” But as the Netherflame Oldman’s gaze flickered with a ferocious light, the Sky Vulture Emperor’s voice had resounded once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the Netherflame Oldman grew even darker as he fixed his gaze onto Mu Chen. But in the end, he slowly shifted his gaze away, because he knew that the Sky Vulture Emperor wasn’t wrong with his words. No matter how fast he was with his action, even if he could slaughter Mu Chen in an instant, their Netherworld Palace would lose a Seventh Grade Sovereign as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a loss greater than Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Consider this a win for your Great Havenlaw Domain this time. But don’t be too complacent. Once my Palace Master knows about this, he definitely won’t let this matter go so easily!” The Netherflame Oldman eerily smiled as he coldly snorted. With a wave of his sleeves, his silhouette had disappeared and the next time he appeared, he was already before the Netherworld Palace’s party. At the same time, the Sky Vulture Emperor had appeared before the Great Havenlaw Domain with the Glacier King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them were Eighth Grade Sovereigns, so they did not play any meaningless acts. Because they were clear that if both of them were to completely disregard everything and fight, their subordinates would suffer great casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Sky Vulture Emperor!” When the Kings saw the Sky Vulture Emperor appear before them, they immediately cupped their fists in salutation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor smiled as he waved his hand, before looking at Mu Chen. “Congratulations to you, King Mu, for becoming a Battle Formation Master. Finally, there’s a Battle Formation Master in my Great Havenlaw Domain after all these years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He briefly paused his words before popping the most important question. “How’s the current situation with the Fallen Origin Pellets?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We have already calculated it. We have a total of 430,000 Fallen Origin Pellets with us,” replied the Asura King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“430,000 Fallen Origin Pellets?” The Sky Vulture Emperor’s eyes lit up as he smiled in gratitude. “Not bad, it’s a lot more than the previous time. The Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury this time is very peculiar, but it should be sufficient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Without King Mu leading us in this Hunting War, I’m afraid that we wouldn’t have been able to obtain enough Fallen Origin Pellets.” The Mountain Splitting King smiled as he pointed out Mu Chen’s contributions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed. Among the 430,000 Fallen Origin Pellets, there’s a majority that came from the King Mu’s party.” The Asura King had also honestly spoken out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Sky Vulture Emperor heard them, he cast a glance at Mu Chen with astonishment, since he probably never expected that the latter would have such an outstanding performance during the Hunting War. Even the prideful Mountain Splitting King and Asura King had treated him differently and were even so polite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mountain Splitting King is overrating me. If it wasn’t for the other Kings working together, I’m afraid that I would not have been able to do much.” Mu Chen was also stunned by the Mountain Splitting King pointing him out. However, he wasn’t arrogant and conceited, but had only revealed a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Looks like the Domain Ruler and Nine Nether weren’t wrong with their eyes.” The Sky Vulture Emperor rather admired Mu Chen’s attitude, which wasn’t arrogant or hot-tempered, as he sighed out. In the beginning, the reason why his attitude was so good to Mu Chen was mostly due to Nine Nether. But in the end, it was because of the care that the Domain Ruler had for Mu Chen. And now, he finally realised that this young man indeed had a unique charm and ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along his way here, as he climbed from amongst the most common Commanders of the Great Havenlaw Domain. His improvements were speechless and astonishing and no one had any idea how far he would reach in the future…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether looked at Mu Chen, feeling gratified that Mu Chen had gotten the acknowledgement of the Great Havenlaw Domain step by step before smiling towards the Sky Vulture Emperor. “Elder Vulture, you’ve previously said that the Domain Ruler has found the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Kings heard that, they had immediately pricked their ears. All their fights and struggles in the Fallen Battlefield was to make preparations to open the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury. And they were all helpless in searching for the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury, so they could only rely on the Domain Ruler for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor nodded his head with a smile. He looked a little helpless as he said, “The Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury has been found, but there’s a small problem…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Problem?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the deepest part of the Fallen Battlefield, which was also the most violent region, it’s been enveloped in a storm of Spiritual Energy. It’s a place where even Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses would have a hard time advancing. After several failures, we really did discover traces of an Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury. This Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury is extremely huge, far exceeding any other Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury that we have found in the past.” The Sky Vulture Emperor slowly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” The minds of the Kings jolted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But, due to this Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury being too big, there are other forces eyeing it as well.” The Sky Vulture Emperor helplessly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and the rest showed amazement on their faces, while feeling a numbing sensation on their scalps. That’s because just thinking about the scenario of having six or seven Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses covetously eyeing the same thing made them feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a fight broke out, it would definitely be a great disaster. Under a battle of that level, they were practically pale in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do now?” said Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Prepare to move out towards the depths of the Fallen Battlefield. No matter what, we can’t give up on this Earth Sovereign Realm treasury. Judging from how majestic that thing is, the owner of this Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury must be extremely powerful. If we can obtain the Spiritual Divine Liquid that’s within it, the Domain Ruler might be able to make a breakthrough to the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm. Whereas if it was obtained by the Divine Pavilion Master, Netherworld Palace Master or Liu Tiandao, it will definitely not be good news for our Great Havenlaw Domain.” The Sky Vulture Emperor solemnly said.</span></p>

Although they had no idea how great of a difference there would be between a Lesser and Greater Earth Sovereign Realm expert, since it was spoken out in such a tone by the Sky Vulture Emperor, then it must’ve been difference between day and night. At the same time, the fate of their Great Havenlaw Domain was hung on it.</span></p>

Thereafter, Mu Chen and the rest had also sensed something and raised their heads with shock revealed on their faces.</span></p>

A majestic Spiritual Energy emanated from his body and had formed into a barrier of a few myriad feet that enveloped the entire party of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
