 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the four of them charged into the ruined city, a boundless feeling blew over and the scene before their eyes dazzled them. Vaguely, an indescribably massive ancient city appeared before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The constructs in the city were towering to the clouds, filled with wildness and innumerable silhouettes were streaking across the horizon, while heavens and earth were filled with trembling roars of beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The roars resounded near their ears and the eyes of Mu Chen’s group flashed. The boundless scene before them disappeared and the city before them had turned back into tattered ruins, filling their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether exchanged a glance and knew that those scenes were remnant scenes that couldn’t last too long and they could be only somewhat felt by others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a pity for such a majestic city.” Mu Chen sighed. This was the first time he had seen such a majestic city. Compared to this, the cities under their Great Havenlaw Domain were too insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This place was, after all, once a pinnacle force in the Divine Beast Origin.” Nine Nether nodded her head. In terms of strength, perhaps even their Nine Netherbird Clan might not be able to win against this former Great Desolate City. So one could tell the terrifying strength that this city possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though they’re powerful, they still couldn’t avoid the fate of destruction...” Mu Chen gently sighed. For the Great Thousand World, the Fiend Clans were truly a disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the two of them spoke, they did not stop and the streaks of light flew across the horizon, swiftly making their way towards the centre of this city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had all sensed an extremely desolate fluctuation coming from that direction. Clearly, only the Primordial Body Refining Pagoda left behind could have such might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s group had a flash in their eyes and their speed abruptly burst, before they streaked across space. Nearly half an hour later, they had gradually slowed down their speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their four silhouettes appeared on the roof of a tattered stone building. When they appeared, their eyes were fixed before them and they saw a smooth ground. The ground here wasn’t as damaged as it was in other places of the city, it was quite well-preserved and all of this was clearly because of the mottled and ancient pagoda that quietly stood at the centre of this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pagoda was dark-grey in colour, with extremely ancient runes on the surface of the pagoda. It was as if it was formed naturally. &nbsp;Standing in this area, even if it wasn’t especially majestic, their breathing had frozen as they looked at it. A horrifying surge of pressure swept over, which made them feel a vague pain on their bodies, making them feel like they were being broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Primordial Body Refining Pagoda?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at this ancient pagoda and felt the pressure surging over. His gaze had gradually turned heated. Even without him entering it, just approaching it alone made him feel his blood and flesh boiling. This feeling had nearly caused him to lose control and charge in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had still forcefully restrained himself. Although the mottled pagoda before him seemed to have experienced countless ages of time and gave off a tattered feeling, Mu Chen could still sense how terrifying it was. If he was to forcefully charge his way in, he might be instantly reduced to ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not to mention you, even Lesser Earth Sovereigns do not dare to carelessly charge into this Primordial Body Refining Pagoda.” Nine Nether seemed to have seen through the thoughts in Mu Chen’s mind and reminded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard her words, his heart jolted. Although he could sense how fearsome this body refining pagoda was, he never expected that even Earth Sovereigns would not dare to carelessly charge in. It looked like he had underestimated this ancient building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was also within his expectations, since this Body Refining Pagoda was made from a huge amount of resources by those peak forces. So how could it not look fearsome? Otherwise, how could the pagoda remain until today, when the entire Divine Beast Origin was in a tattered condition?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like this Primordial Body Refining Pagoda has attracted quite a bit of people.” Mo Feng’s gaze shifted from the Body Refining Pagoda. He squinted his eyes and looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mo Feng swept his gaze around, Mu Chen had already sensed sharp gazes shooting over in this region, which enveloped them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen brows twitched, before he looked towards the direction of several especially ferocious gazes and saw four silhouettes on the ruined peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bodies of those four were robust like iron towers, donned in black armour and a dense ominous aura emanated from them. Their eyes were scarlet and a pitch-black, slightly curved rhino horn was on their foreheads. It’s as if those horns could pierce through space, looking extremely sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s the clansmen of the Demonic Rhino Clan… I never thought that they would be here. This clan specialises in physical body cultivation and hold extraordinary strength. The moment they fight with others, they would be like mad demons. They’re extremely tough to deal with.” Nine Nether looked over as well and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gently nodded his head. Even with the distance between them, they could still feel the four powerful bodies that could possibly shatter mountains with their moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the four, the one leading was even more fearsome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The leading one should be the genius of the Demonic Rhino Clan of the younger generations, Han Shan…” Nine Nether swept a glance at the leading black-armoured figure and whispered, “This person has already stepped into the Seventh Grade sovereign Realm and with his powerful physique, his fighting strength is extremely extraordinary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, Nine Nether’s face had turned a little grave, since she knew that even with all her strength, she could probably only fight on par with Han Shan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slightly squinted his eyes. This Han Shan was truly a formidable figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the west should be the Fire Crane Clan… That’s the Draconic Ape Clan over there… Skyeater Crane Clan… Now that’s a spectacular scene.” Mo Feng swept his gaze, which turned even more solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard the names of those clans from Mo Feng, his brows uncontrollably twitched. They were Spiritual Beast Clans with decent fame in the Great Thousand World, and he never expected that they would all be gathered here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like there would be a ferocious battle this time in the competition for the opportunity within the Primordial Body Refining Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mu Chen sighed, his gaze suddenly changed when he sensed an overbearing gaze that was suddenly directed over and enveloped the four of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, Nine Nether, Mo Feng and Mo Ling had sensed this and they looked in that direction. On a ruined construct stood five silhouettes. Liu Qing and the other three that they previously had a conflict with were amongst that group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the five of them were from the Sky Roc Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that’s the case, then the one leading them should be the genius of the Sky Roc Clan that Liu Qing had spoken of, Zong Teng, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought about it, Mu Chen had shifted his gaze over. Standing before Liu Qing was a black-clothed man with his hands behind his back. He did not have a robust figure. On the contrary, he even looked somewhat thin. But under his indifferent expression, there was a surge of unconcealable overbearingness that emanated from him, which made many experts in this region look at him with, more or less, fear in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at Zong Teng and slightly squinted his eyes. From the latter, he had indeed sensed a dangerous aura. This person was clearly not any weaker than Han Shan of the Demonic Rhino Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Teng directed his gaze over and his faint voice resounded, “Some years ago, the younger generations of my Sky Roc Clan and your Nine Netherbird Clan have sparred, while I was in secluded cultivation, thus allowing your Nine Netherbird Clan to win. But no worries, if there’s a chance, I will personally seek some teachings and see if the Nine Netherbird Clan is truly that capable.”</span></p>

He had slightly closed his eyes. His gaze was only on Nine Nether and Mo Feng. As for Mu Chen and Mo Ling, the two of them were naturally disregarded by him.</span></p>

Although experts had gathered like clouds here, he wasn’t afraid. Despite being only a Sixth Grade Sovereign, the price for underestimating him was something that no one could bear.</span></p>

After half a day, more Spiritual Beast Clans had arrived and, at this moment, even more silhouettes had filled this region. But even if the number of people increased, this place was still silent.
