 <p><strong>Chapter 435 - Preparations of the Spiritual Academy’s Grand Tournament</strong></p>
 <p>The operation to eliminate the Demonic Dragon Palace took a near ten days before being completely finished in the Northern Heavens Continent. When the numerous experts from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy started to retreat, all of the powers in the Northern Heavens Continent knew that the Demonic Dragon Palace, the power that was once able to contend with the former, would no longer appear on the Northern Heavens Continent any more…</p>
 <p>Numerous powers quietly sighed at this result. Nevertheless, it was fortunate that the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy didn’t possess a tyrant’s heart. If not, there might not be any power left in this Northern Heavens Continent that could contend against it.</p>
 <p>However, even though that was the case, after observing the genuine magnitude of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, some of the peak powers had also discarded their previous attitude to the former. In the past, due to the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy not showing much attitude in any aspect, not many powers had placed the former in their minds. Now, they had finally discovered that this ferocious tiger creeping in the Northern Heavens Continent had only dozed off. Once this tiger awakened, its fangs were still incomparably ferocious… While the entire Northern Heavens Continent was still in shock, due to the destruction of the Demonic Dragon Palace, joy and jubilation was present within the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy as countless students roared and cheered for this result. For the past few years, the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy would always face danger in the form of the Demonic Dragon Palace when they went out for real world training and tempering. If they were unfortunate, they would bump into ultra fierce characters like Mo Xingtian or Mo Longzi, which would result in a nigh impossible chance of returning back to the academy. Therefore, whenever students headed out of the academy, they would appear to be extraordinarily vigilant and careful.</p>
 <p>However, after today, the malignant tumor in all of the student’s hearts had finally been removed. How could they not jump up for joy?</p>
 <p>Freshman Region. In that small building, Mu Chen sat on the balcony, looking towards the cheering ringing out from within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Raising his head, he looked towards the endless blue sky, where flocks of Spiritual Beasts flew around, their clear cries resounding across the world.</p>
 <p>He had only arrived in this Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy for slightly more than a year. Nevertheless, Mu Chen could clearly sense his personal growth. Slightly more than a year ago, when he had just entered the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, he was merely a Freshman who hadn’t even properly stepped into the Heavenly Fusion Stage. However, at this very moment, he had already properly stepped foot into Heavenly Completion Stage. Furthermore, he possessed the greatest reputation and prestige within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Unconsciously, the youth had already started to transform, becoming dazzling and eye-catching in the process.</p>
 <p>Thinking about this, a faint smile rose from the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth. If his dad knew about this, he would definitely feel proud of him. Naturally, the most important matter was that he had actually managed to find his mother. Although she was only a spiritual body, it had already given Mu Chen inexhaustible confidence. He believed that if he could perserve and grow stronger, there would be a day where he would be able to fulfill the promise he made to his father.</p>
 <p>“Old man, be at ease. I’ll definitely bring Mom home!”</p>
 <p>Muttered Mu Chen as he tightly clenched his hand.</p>
 <p>“Are you still thinking about Aunt Jing?” All of a sudden, a warm and gentle voice rang out from behind him. Mu Chen turned his head around, only to see a black-robed young girl quietly standing behind him. The young girl’s hair flowed down her head, her skin as white as snow. Coupled with her long and willowy eyebrows and absolutely beautiful cheeks that appeared as if they were made of porcelain, she gave people a feeling of so much love that no one wouldn't be able to part from it.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen started to grow absentminded as he stared at the girl before him. After a year, the young girl seemed to have become increasing classy, Her figure had also grown increasingly alluring. Below that slender white neck was a pair of soft bosoms wrapped by her blouse. Those beautiful arcs, that slender waist that could be grabbed in one hand, those long and smooth legs…</p>
 <p>While he was maturing, the young girl beside him had increasingly blossomed into a female beauty capable of captivating even the birds and the beasts.</p>
 <p>Now, Mu Chen was starting to get slightly restless.</p>
 <p>Noticing the tight gaze coming from Mu Chen towards her, with flames appearing to be gushing out from his eyes, caused Luo Li’s lovable face to turn slightly red. <em>This Mu Chen’s really covering up less and less of his inner desires in front of me.</em></p>
 <p>“Have you seen enough?” Finally, unable to endure the invasive gaze from Mu Chen, Luo Li shot a question to the fromer as her face turned pinkish with embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Leaping over, Mu Chen extended his hand and grabbed onto Luo Li’s slender waist. Pushing his face near her sparklingly tender ear, he spoke out softly. “Ah, Luo Li. Look at how my mom likes you. When will you give her a granddaughter?”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Luo Li instantly gawked, before her lovable face immediately turned as red as a scorching fire as she stared towards Mu Chen with incomparable embarrassment. <em>This fellow’s really getting more and more over the top! He even dares to say such words!</em></p>
 <p>Seeing the embarrassment present on Luo Li’s face, a cheeky smile appeared on Mu Chen’s face as he thought of wanting to tease her a bit more. However, what he saw was Luo Li’s little hand covering her scabbard. In the next instant, with a gentle lift, the Luo Shen Sword was unsheathed halfway out from its scabbard, sending a chilling glint shooting and illuminating Mu Chen’s throat. The chilling intent present in the glint caused Mu Chen to slightly shiver.</p>
 <p>Cough.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen dryly coughed, before carefully grabbing on to Luo Li’s little hand. Pushing the sword back into its scabbard, a resentful expression appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>Seeing his actions, Luo Li rolled her eyes at him. However, upon seeing the resentful look on his face, she slightly hesitated. With a blush, she rose to her toe tips, and placed her soft lips gently on his.</p>
 <p>Such a gentle touch, yet it caused a shiver to run down Mu Chen’s heart.</p>
 <p>Placing her hands on Mu Chen’s chest, Luo Li gave a light shove, pushing him away. With her lovable face flushed with an alluring crimson shade, she spoke with a displeased tone. “Don’t misbehave. The Dean’s calling us over.”</p>
 <p>“The Dean’s calling for us?” A blank look appeared on Mu Chen’s face.</p>
 <p>“It’s regarding the matter of the Gate of the Northern Heavens. Half a year from now, it will be the Grand Spiritual Academy Tournament. We have to make early preparations for it and increase our strength as much as possible. If not…” replied Luo Li softly.</p>
 <p>Hearing that, a faint wrinkle appeared on Mu Chen’s forehead. Although the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was one of the five Great Academies, it was considered to be at the bottom in that list. For the past few years, it was commonplace for them to rank last within the five Great Academies. This time, if they weren’t able to achieve a better result than that, there’s a possibility of people taking advantage of this and causing trouble for the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy by stripping them of their title as one of the five Great Academies. Although this was just a title, it was an extremely critical matter for the Spiritual Academies.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Nodding his head, Mu Chen held Luo Li’s hand before shooting straight towards the giant hall at the centre-most location of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>After a while, Mu Chen and Luo Li finally entered the giant hall, only to see that Sheng Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, Su Xuan, He Yao, Zhao Qingshan and the rest of the elite characters from the top ten ranks of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Heavenly Rankings were actually already present there. Furthermore, standing above them were Dean Tai Cang, the Northern Sea Dragon, as well as the five great Heavenly Seated Elders. Such a lineup appeared exceedingly serious and solemn.</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen arrived in the giant hall, the eyes of everyone present within instantly shot over, some containing complicated feelings, as well as admiration. Ever since the battle at the Divine Spiritual Mountain where Mu Chen had exterminated Mo Xingtian, he had already been considered to possess the title of the strongest student within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Although he has not yet issued any challenge to the Overlord of the Heavenly Rankings, Sheng Cangsheng, everyone was clear that he already possessed the strength and capability to do so…</p>
 <p>Arriving at the giant hall, Mu Chen and Luo Li could also feel the serious and solemn atmosphere present within. Shooting a look at each other, they started to walk into the giant hall, before standing beside Sheng Cangsheng and sending a smile towards them.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Mu Chen, Dean Tai Cang also gave a faint smile as a greeting. He was getting more and more satisfied towards the youth in front of him. Finally, after so many years, a monstrous talent has appeared their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy…</p>
 <p>“Students, the main reason I’ve called you all over is for the Grand Spiritual Academy Tournament happening half a year from now.”</p>
 <p>Sweeping his gaze across the giant hall, Dean Tai Cang’s gaze gradually grew solemn as he continued speaking, “I’ve told everyone before that our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy has always placed last place within the five Great Academies in every Grand Spiritual Academy Tournament held in the last couple of years. There are even some other elite Spiritual Academies who had results that surpassed us, This has caused extreme pressure for our academy for those years. If we are to continue getting the same results in this Grand Spiritual Academy Tournament, I think that we should remove the title of being one of the five Great Academies from the name of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing his words, the entire giant hall turned silent while the expressions on the faces of Sheng Cangsheng, Li Xuantong and the rest also turned solemn. After training and cultivating in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy for so many years, all of them had similarly developed feelings for the academy. They took pride in being a part of the academy. If the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was to be striped of from the title as being one of the five Great Academies, this was something that would be hard for them to accept.</p>
 <p>Over the years, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had usually advocated equality, not specially favoring certain students with outstanding talents and also not giving some other students super level statuses. Therefore, it was extremely hard for the academy to attract genius students with absolutely astonishing talent. After all, those people would most likely have arrogance and haughtiness in their package. In other Spiritual Academies, they would be set up high and placed above all ordinary students, while being able to enjoy benefit after benefit. To them, the advantages of this were too many. Therefore, they would naturally not be willing to recklessly enter the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Another reason for this was that the other four Great Spiritual Academies were established much earlier than the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. It's said that all of the four other Great Academies possessed a secret training place that was able to greatly increase the strength of their students. These would increase the strength of their talented students to become even more astonishing. On the contrary, although the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had the “Door of the Northern Heavens”, due to its closure for the past few years, it has led to their elite students possessing strength that couldn’t be compared to the other four Great Academies. Therefore, this resulted in the lackluster results in the Grand Spiritual Academy Tournament and the eventual laughing stock they had turned into.</p>
 <p>However, this time, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was prepared to open the “Door of the Northern Heavens” once again in hopes of letting them bridge this disparity.</p>
 <p>“Dean, do you know exactly which of those extremely outstanding students from the other four Great Spiritual Academies are participating?” After slightly pondering, Mu Chen opened his mouth shot a question off.</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Sheng Cangsheng and the rest turned their gazes towards Dean Tai Cang. Clearly they were also extremely curious about this question.</p>
 <p>“Having a greater and more robust foundation than us, the talents the other four Great Academies can admit are much more than us. Furthermore, they had also used some special methods to attract them over…” replied Dean Tai Cang with a helpless smile, “Therefore, according to the information that we’ve gathered, up till now, on the aspects of quantity and quality of their elite students, our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy is still in a disadvantageous position.”</p>
 <p>“As of most recently, there are four extremely prominent talents that have erupted out from the four Great Academies. Furthermore, these four people… are Freshmen that have just entered the Spiritual Academies for a year or so…”</p>
 <p>Whoosh.</p>
 <p>An uproar instantly rose within the giant hall as shock and astonishment were present in everyone’s eyes. It was already enough that their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had a freak like Mu Chen. However, there’s actually more of such abnormal people in the other four Great Spiritual Academies?</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Mu Chen’s eyes instantly contracted. Raising his head to look towards Dean Tai Cang, he spoke in a soft voice, “What’s the name of the person from the Saint Spiritual Academy?”</p>
 <p>Shooting a deep look back towards Mu Chen, Dean Tai Cang slowly spoke out name that caused Mu Chen’s gaze to turn completely ice-cold.</p>
 <p>“Ji Xuan.”</p>
