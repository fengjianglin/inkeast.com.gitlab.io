They weren’t too clear about the so-called ‘Successors’. However, from the meaning held in the word, it should be an opportunity, but it was impossible for the two of them to obtain it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They glanced at the tubular green sea of lightning that had green lightning dragons roaring within it, unleashing astonishing might. Although the two of them had the opportunity, it was something that they could obtain after being able to keep their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing at the side of Mu Chen, Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan also glanced at Xue Tiandou in astonishment. Clearly, they had also not expected that he would be the same as Mu Chen, obtaining the identity of a Successor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I never expected that you would also be able to obtain the identity of a Successor.”</span></p>

His handsome face was filled with a smile, except it was a smile with a chill, “But are you sure that you can handle this opportunity? The Divine Wood Lightning Dipper isn’t as easy as you think.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You better not die here.” Mu Chen said with a smile.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen deeply inhaled a mouthful of air as a smear of graveness flashed in the depths of his eyes. Shortly after, he no longer had any hesitation as he took a step forward, turning into a streak of light as he charged into the sea of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s figure had moved, Xue Tiandou had also turned into a bloody light as he charged into the sea of lightning without any traces of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Black lightning flickered around him, but the speed of the lightning was extremely high. If one could see through the lightning, they would discover a black patch on Mu Chen’s chest, even his flesh was a little messed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How formidable.”</span></p>

He had already cultivated the Lightning God’s Physique to Penta Rune Lightning Physique. Not even Late Spiritual Energy experts could hurt him. However, he was clearly injured from a bolt of green lightning. The so-called Divine Wood Lightning Dipper was, indeed, tyrannical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen tightened his fist as black lightning frantically flickered. The five lightning runes on his chest flickered as he had already activated his Lightning God’s Physique to the limit. Faced with such a situation, despite the fact that he possessed a powerful physical body, he did not dare to be careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen suffered another green lightning strike, Xue Tiandou had bloody light surging around his surroundings not far away. The latter pushed both his palms out as they turned into a huge, scarlet bloody hand as it clashed with the incoming green lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huge collisions resounded as the bloody hand was shattered. Xue Tiandou retreated a few dozen feet as his eyes flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When countless people looked at the two people, they inwardly smacked their lips. Those two were indeed, not people that were easy to be dealt with. One actually dared to used his physical body to confront the lightning, while the other used his powerful Spiritual Energy to face it. The strength of those two caused fear to rise in others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s begin as well.” Luo Li said as she looked at Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan nodded before looking at her team, “You guys stay here. There’s no need for you guys to move forward.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sea of lightning was so extremely rampant that even Spiritual Energy experts would find it hard to go through. If her teammates were to face it, it would be a little too forceful for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pin’er, Le’er and the rest nodded their heads at her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan and Luo Li’s figures moved as they rapidly flew out, charging into a patch of the green lightning sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhhhuuu!</span></p>

They had powerful Spiritual Energy ripples around them, clearly they possessed powerful strengths. Therefore, they had some confidence in being able to last a joss stick time in the challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhong, Wu Yingying and the rest of similar level charged into the sea of lightning as well. They naturally had quite the confidence in their strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As one figure after another constantly charged into the sea of lightning, it suddenly turned rampant as one bolt of green lightning after another shot out from the sea of lightning onto those figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Their Spiritual Energy was thoroughly wrecked by the lightning as it struck them. They flew back a few hundred feet in a terrible state. Many of them were spurting blood as their faces were overwhelmed with astonishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after experiencing the power of it, did they realise how difficult it was to hold on till the end of the joss stick time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the sea of lightning, when those who had yet to step in saw the scene unfold before them, they instantly suppressed their hearts that had begun to stir. Although treasures were tempting, their lives were even more important. This Divine Wood Academy wasn’t a place where anything could bear fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Explosions of thunder constantly rang by Mu Chen’s ears as he swept his glance around. This sea of lightning was in chaos. However, there wasn’t anyone in the few thousand foot radius in the area he was in. They were probably afraid that the disaster brought by the identity as Successor would affect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was struck back once again as fresh blood flowed down from his arm. The intense pain had made him frown his brows. His charming face had no emotion on it. He looked at the other direction that had bloody light spreadingout. Xue Tiandou was withstanding the lightning using his powerful Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Xue Tiandou would be forcefully moved back from the lightning, he was in a much better state compared to Mu Chen. The appearance of the latter was much better as he did not have any injuries on his body. However, Mu Chen had blood flowing down his body, which made him appear in a pretty terrible state</span></p>

Their bodies were black as they appeared in a horrible state. The sight of them caused many people to feel fear as they realised that everyone that was sent flying out were all those that had reached Spiritual Energy Disaster in strength.</span></p>
