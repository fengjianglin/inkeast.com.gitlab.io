 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

They only recovered a brief moment later and all of them kneeled down to one knee as their respectful voices rang out across the horizon, ““We welcome Lord back to the palace!””</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dense joy was contained in their voices. They never imagined that their lord of the Nine Nether Palace would return at this time. They had initially thought that the lord of the Nine Nether Palace would never again return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ear-deafening voices also made Nine Nether feel startled. When she left, there weren’t so many people in the Nine Nether Palace. Furthermore, she wasn’t good at management matters. Thus, things would be in a complete mess most of the time and not as majestic as today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You two sisters have already done a pretty good job, managing the Nine Nether Palace to become such a state.” Nine Nether held onto the girl in her embrace as she happily smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is all Big Sister’s hard work.” The light-red clothes girl that seemed gentle and weak shyly said as she rubbed her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether smiled as she looked at the girl in black. The latter was biting on her rosy lips, the cold and sharp light that was initially in her eyes disappeared. However, she was evidently more controlled. Although she was excited in her heart, she did not lose her composure as she slightly bowed. “I welcome Lord’s return to the Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Bing’er, I have told you before to call me Big Sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether held her hand as she showed tender love in her eyes. “It must have been tough on you guys for all these years, right? It’s all my fault, I nearly couldn’t make it back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord…” The girl in black hastily shook her head. But when she saw Nine Nether staring at her, she immediately changed her way of addressing her, “How can I dare to blame Big Sister. When Big Sister left, you left the Nine Nether Palace to us sisters. So we would naturally give our very best for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Nether Palace was just a showpiece, only you are stubborn.” Nine Nether said helplessly. Back then, she was the weakest amongst the nine kings, with her strength back then. Thus, many people were unhappy with her position as a king, but they didn’t dare to say anything with the Sky Vulture Emperor and her background. However, when she left, the two girls must have suffered quite a bit with their strength. That girl, Tang Bing, was also exceptionally stubborn, so even if she suffered anything, she would grit her teeth and endure it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about all those years that the two sisters must have suffered in silence, Nine Nether felt heartache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether looked around as she seemed to have recalled something and asked with her brows furrowed, “Where’s Cao Feng? Back then, when I left, I had instructed him to assist you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that name, the faces of the two girls slightly changed. The girl in black named Tang Bing bit on her rosy lips as she briefly hesitated. But ultimately, she inhaled a deep breath and explained, “Big Sister… Cao Feng, he… has joined the Blood Hawk King… he has already left our Nine Nether Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she finished her words, she saw Nine Nether, who was smiling, change her face as the atmosphere became a little frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feeble girl in Nine Nether’s embrace clenched her teeth as she said with indignation, “Cao Feng is an ungrateful wretch. Seeing as there wasn’t any news of Big Sister for a year, he left the Nine Nether Palace and joined the Blood Hawk King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, if it wasn’t for Big Sister taking pity on him and saving him from the pile of corpses, if it wasn’t for big sister, he could have had such achievements today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether lightly patted the girl’s head as she sighed, “I know Cao Feng has a strong heart utilitarian, but I never expected that he couldn’t even last a few years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a little disappointment in her voice. Back then, the things that the youth had undergone were rather pitiful, which moved her compassion and helped him. But she never thought that his character would be so disappointing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister, rest assured, we won’t let that traitor off in the future!” Tang Bing gritted her teeth as she spoke. Although Nine Nether wasn’t too bothered by Cao Feng’s betrayal, Tang Bing couldn’t endure it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, her family was entirely murdered by enemies in chaos. If it wasn’t for Nine Nether, the two sisters would have definitely end up worse than dead. Therefore, they had treated Nine Nether as their benefactor. Thus, they couldn’t endure anything that would hurt Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for the Nine Nether Palace’s strength being weak and they still had a step to breakthrough to the Sovereign Realm, they definitely wouldn’t forgive that traitor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether smiled after hearing their words. She wasn’t too hurt by Cao Feng’s betrayal. After all, she clearly had more affection for the two sisters before her eyes. Their persistence made her feel gratified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister will never leave you guys anymore.” Nine Nether smiled and shifted her gaze to Tang Bing, “Xiao Bing’er, you seem to have yet to breakthrough to the Sovereign Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she left, Tang Bing had already achieved the Heavenly Completion Stage, just a step away from the Three Sovereign Disasters. According to her talent and in addition to the resources in the Great Havenlaw Domain, it’s impossible for her to have yet to make her breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing’s face turned red as she lightly nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big sister Nine Nether, don’t blame big sister. Big sister hasn’t used a single Sovereign Spiritual Liquid in her cultivation. Those Sovereign Spiritual Liquids we received from the Great Havenlaw Domain were all given to the newcomers to nurture them. Otherwise, the Nine Nether Palace wouldn’t have such a scene.” The girl in light-red called Tang Rou helped her sister to explain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Nine Nether was stunned as she cast a glance at those thousands of figures orderly kneeling down and said in doubt, “Our Nine Nether Palace should be able to obtain 10,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids a year. In addition to the territories that we have, we should also be able to obtain nearly 10,000 from it as well, how is that insufficient?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Rou was about to speak, but was glared at by Tang Bing and shut her mouth. “Xiao Bing’er, you speak.” Seeing their small actions, Nine Nether seemed to have sensed something as her voice turned cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her, Tang Bing bitterly smiled. “Big Sister Nine Nether, when you left, the other lords said that our Nine Nether Palace doesn’t deserve it, barely a King Power in the Great Havenlaw Domain. Thus, they joined together in the Elders Association in an attempt to disband our Nine Nether Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But because of Lord Sky Vulture Emperor helping us to speak, we managed to maintain the Nine Nether Palace. But the amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids we could obtain was decreased to 5000.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for our territories, many of the flourishing cities was secretly devoured by the other lords. We were weak, and could not compete against them, so we could only silently suffer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because of them, the amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids that our Nine Nether Palace could use is barely over 5000 a year.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Rou softly added, “Yeah, big sister requires a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids to break through to the Sovereign Realm. So she did not dare to attempt as every Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was distributed to everyone, thus delaying her cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is too much!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether glared as her face was covered in anger, her ample chest was lightly heaving up and down. Clearly, she had been thoroughly angered. She never expected that when she left, those fellows would try to exploit the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She naturally knew that those lords that Tang Bing and Tang Rou spoke of were a few of the kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, when she was still present, those fellows were unhappy with her insufficient strength and yet, having the same rank as them. But due to her background, no one dared to say a word. But she never thought that the moment she left, those bastards couldn’t hold themselves back anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s face was covered with frost as a Spiritual Energy pressure uncontrollably swept out. In an instant, there were a few that couldn’t stand the pressure and laid down on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing was also forced back several steps, but her face was filled with joy as she looked at Nine Nether, “Big sister Nine Nether has succeeded your Tribulation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy pressure coming from Nine Nether wasn’t any weaker than the other kings.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks during her disappearance, Big Sister has successfully gone through her Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether lightly nodded her head as she waved her hand. “The rest of you can return first. No matter how many grievances you guys have suffered in the past, now that I’m back, I will not allow anyone to bully our Nine Nether Palace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words were naturally directed at the rest on the field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, everyone in the Nine Nether Palace was filled with excitement as they replied in order as they left in an orderly manner as well. Every single one of their eyes was filled with excitement. Now that someone was backing the Nine Nether Palace, they could finally break free from all those indignations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the field returned to calmness, the frost on Nine Nether’s face slowly faded as she waved her hand, “Mu Chen, you can come out now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing and Tang Rou were stunned as they saw a streak of light fly over and appear beside Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen appeared as he gave a friendly smile towards Tang Bing and Tang Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Rou was a little shy as she immediately shifted her gaze away when her gaze came into contact with Mu Chen’s. Tang Bing, however, was cautiously staring at him. Due to Cao Feng’s matter in the past, she was now cautious towards any guys that came near Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is Mu Chen, he was the reason why I succeeded my Tribulation this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether pointed at the two girls as she continued, “This is Tang Bing and Tang Rou, the two of them are my sisters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that Mu Chen had done a great deal help to Nine Nether, Tang Rou endured her shyness and gave Mu Chen a look of gratefulness. As for Tang Bing, she took more glances at Mu Chen and nodded her head at him, considering that she barely accepted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Bing’er, how much Sovereign Spiritual Liquids do you need to attempt a breakthrough to the Sovereign Realm?” Nine Nether suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At least 1000.” Tang Bing briefly hesitated as she reported as little as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen smiled as he grasped his hand. A jade bottle appeared in his hand with a flicker and handed it over to Tang Bing, “Big Sister Tang Bing, here’s 2000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, it should be sufficient for you to break through.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking Liu Ming’s Mustard Seed Bracelet, Mu Chen had obtained a considerable amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids from it. Thus, he was rather generous when he gave them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing was stunned, but she did not take it as she shifted her gaze over to Nine Nether. She only lightly received it when she saw the latter nodding her head. The ice on her face had also melted a little as she gently said to Mu Chen, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the future, Mu Chen will join our Nine Nether Palace. Everyone can consider him to be a part of the family.” Nine Nether pulled the hands of the two girls as she smiled, “I intended to let Mu Chen become the Commander of our Nine Nether Palace to fight for the Great Law Goldpond, do any of you have any opinions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Tang Rou and Tang Bing froze again as they exchanged a look and did not dare to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong, Xiao Bing’er’s intending to object?” Nine Nether couldn’t help being curious as she looked at their reactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, Big Sister can naturally make the decision to this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing immediately shook her head. She hesitated for a brief moment before bitterly smiling. “Two years ago, the quota for our Nine Nether Palace for the Great Law Goldpond was forcefully purchased by Blood Hawk King for 1000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids. We didn’t have any ability to resist. Thus, it has been a long time since our Nine Nether Palace had the qualifications to fight for the Great Law Goldpond.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she finished speaking, Nine Nether’s face had thoroughly turned cold as she gritted her teeth. Her eyes were spewing with flames.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King, that bastard, he is taking this too far!</span></p>
