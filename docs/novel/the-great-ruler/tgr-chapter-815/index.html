Evidently, the entire Great Havenlaw Domain had known of his feat in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven through special channels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His achievements had greatly given a great amount of face to the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all these years, despite being one of the peak forces, the Great Havenlaw Domain had been in the last in the younger generations amongst the various peak forces of the Northern Region. Especially when the genius of their Great Havenlaw Domain was killed by the expert of the Netherworld Palace back then, it had greatly embarrassed the Great Havenlaw Domain. Therefore, the Great Havenlaw Domain had given up the opportunity for the Dragon-Phoenix Haven for all these years, until today…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the start, when Mandala had announced of Mu Chen’s participation in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven and representing the Great Havenlaw Domain, the higher hierarchy of the Great Havenlaw Domain felt slight disapproval in their hearts, even though they said nothing of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the strength that Mu Chen had displayed made them understand the potential he possessed, he was still too far away from the elites on the Dragon-Phoenix Record.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, no one was optimistic of Mu Chen taking part in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Perhaps there might have been some people thinking that he would just embarrass himself in going to the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, regardless of the thoughts of others, Mu Chen had managed to enter the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the Great Havenlaw Domain received news that made them all feel dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had defeated Liu Yan, confronted the Netherworld Prince and, in the end, successfully ascended to the tenth step of the Dragon-Phoenix Stairs, successfully obtaining the most precious inheritance in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. The name of the Great Havenlaw Domain’s Mu Chen had covered up the names of many reputable elites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That caused the entire Great Havenlaw Domain to stir.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those in the higher hierarchy that felt doubtful in their hearts earlier were practically speechless. Although they felt that it was a little hard to believe, they had to admit that this youth before them, who was initially nothing to them, had soared in the Northern Region like a comet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps, not long from now, he would become a famed existence in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the celebration, those in the Nine Nether Palace were undoubtedly the happiest and the most proud. Mu Chen came to their Nine Nether Palace along with Nine Nether, becoming the Commander of their Nine Nether Palace at the same time. His outstanding performance made them feel proud for the Nine Nether Palace that had been suppressed for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the future, no one in the Great Havenlaw Domain would dare to belittle their Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The celebration lasted for an entire two days, before the excitement gradually dissipated. Mu Chen had also finally managed to break free from all sorts of entanglements and returned to the Nine Nether Palace to rest. In his view, this celebration was basically even more exhausting and difficult than the fights in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Nine Nether Palace, the bright moon hung high in the sky with the chilly moonlight shining down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen reclined on the roof of the Nine Nether Palace with his hands supporting the back of his head. He looked at the bright moon with a lazy gaze as the chilled breeze blew. His body, which had been tensed up for a long time, was also slowly relaxing at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stench of blood that had stuck to him in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was also gradually dissipating at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the bright moon and a gorgeous figure with long, silvery hair appeared in his mind. Her cool face was like a blade, engraved in the depth of Mu Chen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How are you in the Luo God Clan…?” Mu Chen muttered. After their separation, he had charged his way in the dangerous Great Thousand World, experienced numerous bloody battles and walked on the string between life and death. He did all those to fulfill a promise that he had once given to a girl, that he would become a supreme powerhouse. Just like in the Spiritual Road, he would stand before her and become the knight that protected his princess, cutting his way through all obstacles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also his mother. For the two most important women in his heart, he had to press forth. Regardless of how difficult the path for him to become a supreme powerhouse was, he couldn’t back down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because he needed the power to protect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen narrowed his eyes and slowly clenched his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You look quite free.” A laughter rang out. Mu Chen opened his eyes and saw Nine Nether standing nearby with a smile on her face. The moonlight shone onto her, outlining her impressive curves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lazily pulled the corner of his lips in response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s two pieces of news, which I think you will be very happy to hear.” Nine Nether elegantly sat down beside Mu Chen. Her curvaceous figure was filled with temptation, with her fragrance being able to stir the hearts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Firstly, I have managed to obtain the information about Qin Zhong and Qiu Taiyin.” Nine Nether smiled. She and Mu Chen had a deep relationship together, so she was definitely the first to know about Mandala wanting Mu Chen to strive for the seat of the tenth King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen had only lazily lifted his eyelids. Clearly, that wasn’t much of a happy news to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing his response, Nine Nether wasn't angered. She continued to speak with her eyes narrowed. “There’s another piece of news… from the Western Heaven Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Western Heaven Realm?!” Mu Chen was first stunned, before he immediately sat up and directed his gaze at Nine Nether with joy. He naturally knew that the Luo God Clan was located in the Western Heaven Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the reason why Nine Nether wanted to tell him this information was definitely because it was linked to Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Western Heaven Realm is extremely far from the Greatlaw Continent. If it wasn’t for some special channels, it’s extremely hard for information to come over. I have also paid a huge price to get it.” Nine Nether looked at Mu Chen with her eyes narrowed into smiles as she teased, “How is it? Are you happy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rubbed his nose as he dryly laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether no longer teased Mu Chen and pondered for a brief moment, before saying, “According to the information, ever since Luo Li returned to the Luo God Clan, the Blood God Clan has increased their pace of attacking. The two clans have gone through countless battles with countless casualties and blood flowing like a river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That little girlfriend of yours is pretty good. Ever since she returned to the Luo God Clan, she did not oversee from the Royal Clan and had led an elite force to guard the borders, fighting numerous times with the army of the Blood God Clan.” There was admiration contained in Nine Nether’s tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But hearing her words, Mu Chen’s face couldn’t help changing. The strength of the Luo God Clan and Blood God Clan was stronger than the Great Havenlaw Domain. A level of that battle would definitely have numerous experts assembled that even Sovereign Realm experts weren’t anything much. Luo Li taking the lead herself was undoubtedly the most dangerous thing to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She was right to do that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether took a glance at Mu Chen and faintly said, “It’s said that the Royal Clan of the Luo God Clan is in a mess. It was because of Luo Tianshen that it did not go out of control. Although Luo Li has a noble status, she is still young. If she leads the army herself, not only can she train herself and increase the morale of the Luo God Clan, it will also raise her spot in the Luo God Clan, winning the support of more clansmen and Elders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And the reality has proven that her actions were the right ones. In the past year, when she led the Luo God Clan’s elite army and fought numerous times with the Blood God Clan, her reputation in the Luo God Clan rose higher and higher as well. Especially amongst the younger generations of the Luo God Clan. There were people continuously leaning on her side. In addition to the support of Luo Tianshen, perhaps she might soon become the Empress of the Luo God Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that point in time, perhaps the Luo God clan will rise once again in her hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether gently sighed, “She did not have an easy time, but she did a good job.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Nine Nether’s words, the joy in Mu Chen’s eyes gradually retracted and he looked up at the bright moon. Shortly after, he deeply inhaled a mouthful of chilled air and gradually closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could hear the yells of war that resounded throughout the sky with streaks of light flying everywhere before clashing together with blood and Spiritual Energy bursting at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire heavens and earth were trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a hill in that battlefield, there was a young girl that held a longsword with her silvery long hair fluttering in the wind. Her glass-like pupils looked at the mountains of corpses and the ocean of blood. In the region dyed in crimson and filled with slaughter, her figure was exceptionally tiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen opened his eyes and that scene thoroughly turned his heart cold. So it turns out that after he had come to the Great Thousand World, Luo Li, who had returned to the Luo God Clan, did not have a good time as well. The dangers and pressure that she had to bear far exceeded his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was walking on the string between life and death, Luo Li was also leading a huge army, launching battles with the Blood God Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps she understood Mu Chen and she knew that because of that promise he had made, he wouldn’t back down no matter what dangerous situation he faced. Therefore, she was also working hard in her own way. She hoped that in this way, she could bear some of his pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wasn’t the kind of girl that would quietly wait and watch Mu Chen become covered in blood and wounds in his path to becoming a supreme powerhouse. The kind of girl that could only stand far away and feel the aching in her heart for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Except that doing that, Mu Chen would also feel an aching pain in his heart for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m still not strong enough…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen murmured. Just when he thought that he was working hard enough, he had forgotten that in a distant place, there was a girl that was also working hard just so that he did not have to work so hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured. Luo Li, I will definitely fulfill my promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen clenched his fist as a sharpness soared into his black pupils. The lazy bearing he had earlier completely disappeared. He needed to become even more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the changes in Mu Chen’s bearing, Nine Nether smiled and muttered in her head, “Mu Chen, there will be a day when you become the supreme powerhouse. I have always believed in that from the beginning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give me the information on those two fellows. Right now, I am very interested in it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gave Nine Nether a smile, before extending his hand out. It looks like, in order for Mandala to gather the ten types of Divine Beast’s Blood Essences, he cannot give up on the seat of the tenth King.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For that girl, who was working hard right now.</span></p>
