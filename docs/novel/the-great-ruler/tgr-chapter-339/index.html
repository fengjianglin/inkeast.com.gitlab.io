 <p><strong>Chapter 339 - Got It</strong></p>
 <p>Within this isolated space, Mu Chen looked at the circular pearl, whose jet-blackness was akin to a black hole, with incomparable joy. From the latter’s fluctuations, Mu Chen knew that he had definitely found his target.</p>
 <p>The Lightning God’s Pill!</p>
 <p>“I’ve finally found it.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen suppressed the joy and happiness surging from within his heart, and continued to maintain his vigilance. Rapidly shooting forward, he neared the black floating lotus that seemed to be made of black liquid.</p>
 <p>As he near it, Mu Chen was able to discover that the black lotus was seemingly created from black lightning liquid. However, even though it looked like a liquid, it gave people a mysterious feeling that it was something that can’t be destroyed. Furthermore, Mu Chen was unable to discover a single trace of destructive fluctuations coming from this black lotus that was formed from the lightning liquid.</p>
 <p>This was entirely different from the erratic lightning energies found in the lightning sea that seemed to want to destroy the heavens and wreak the earth.</p>
 <p>After staring at the lightning liquid-like black lotus awhile, Mu Chen turned his attention to the Lightning God’s Pill. This thing was his primary objective, and he needed to immediately acquire it, since the time he had left was getting shorter.</p>
 <p>Extending his hand out, traces of black lightning bolts erupted from the centre of his palm. With a flick of his finger, those lightning bolts shot out, and wrapped around the Lightning God’s Pill like a silkworm’s cocoon.</p>
 <p>Since Mu Chen’s Lightning God Physique had absorbed some energies from the Divine Black Lightning, the Lightning God’s Pill did not develop the slightest resistance against the energy of the same origin as itself. Thus, it would be acquired and stored by Mu Chen in an extremely easy fashion.</p>
 <p>Seeing everything going so smoothly, Mu Chen sighed a breath of relief. A suction force erupted from his palm, and the Lightning God’s Pill, wrapped in the lightning bolt, landed in his hand.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>However, just as the Lightning God’s Pill descended onto his hand, the isolated space instantly started to intensely shake. As the space distorted and warped, signs of it shattering started to appear.</p>
 <p>Seeing this spectacle, the expression on Mu Chen’s face instantly changed. Instantly, he stored the Lightning God’s Pill and was about to leave. However, as his gaze swept across the black liquid lotus floating in the centre, a slight thought entered his mind.</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t exactly know what use this lightning liquid lotus had, for it to be born in the same place as the Lightning God’s Pill, it was definitely not an ordinary object. Since it had appeared before his eyes, why not just conveniently take it? If not, how long do he have to wait for such an opportunity to present itself again?</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen’s eyes sparkled, he extended his hand. Lightning bolts erupted from the centre of his palm again, and brought the lightning liquid lotus into Mu Chen’s hand.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>After storing the lightning liquid lotus, Mu Chen did not dare to stay there a moment longer and explosively shot out from that place. Passing through the collapsing isolated space, he appeared, once again, in the mysterious depths of the lightning sea.</p>
 <p>Chi. Chi.</p>
 <p>A black lightning bolt enveloped Mu Chen’s body. Ramping up his speed to the very extreme of his capabilities, he crazily shot out away from the depths of the lightning sea.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>However, just as he had increased his speed, an astonishingly ferocious roar erupted from the Lightning Spirit, which was being entangled by the Northern Sea Dragon in the air above the lightning sea. Seemingly turning crazy, countless black lightning bolts erupted from it, causing the black waves that were endlessly rushing towards it to explode away from it.</p>
 <p>Seeing this sudden eruption of craziness from the Lightning Spirit, happiness filled the Northern Sea Dragon. From the looks of it, Mu Chen should have already found the Lightning God’s Pill.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>As the Lightning Spirit roared, countless bolts of black lightning, akin to a giant dragons, shot out. Rumbling towards the lightning sea, they attempted to strike and kill Mu Chen, who had stolen the Lightning God’s Pill.</p>
 <p>However, the Northern Sea Dragon was obviously not going to allow it to strike and kill Mu Chen. Opening its giant mouth, cold black air that was sufficient to freeze space gushed out, causing the lightning bolts to completely freeze up.</p>
 <p>Seeing the unending interference of the Northern Sea Dragon, the Lightning Spirit became completely furious. Its gigantic body suddenly blew up, transforming into lightning liquid that blotted the skies. With a scream, it rushed towards the lightning sea. Transforming into a gigantic black bolt of divine lightning that was approximately a mile long, it split apart the lightning sea. With an incomparable speed, it descended to a certain place within the lightning sea.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen was hurrying along in the lightning sea, chilling intent erupted from every pore of his body, as an indescribable aura of death enveloped his heart.</p>
 <p>Furiously raising his head, he saw that the lightning sea was being split apart. A black bolt of divine lightning, approximately a mile long, pierced through. Akin to a heavenly punishment, it locked onto the space surrounding him. There was absolutely no way for him to evade now!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s face turned deathly pale. Facing an attack of such a degree, there was simply no way for him to evade or endure it.</p>
 <p>Facing this kind of attack, the only thing he could do was to simply wait for his death.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>However, just when Mu Chen was totally helpless, the lightning sea was suddenly parted by a frightening energy. Black cold air howled and rushed through, and right before the Divine Black Lightning arrived, it enveloped Mu Chen within it.</p>
 <p>Chi. Chi.</p>
 <p>The black cold air transformed into an iceberg, locking Mu Chen within its depths, who was covered by layers of protection.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>As the Divine Black Lightning furiously struck the iceberg, the lightning sea instantly erupted, causing lightning liquid thousands of metres high to surge out. Gigantic cracks extended out from the iceberg. However, in the end, it had resisted the furious strike from the Lightning Spirit.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>The iceberg shot out. In a flash, it rushed through the lightning sea and appeared in the air.</p>
 <p>The gigantic and endless body of the Northern Sea Dragon rapidly shrank, before turning into the fragile and delicate look of the bald old man. Descending before Mu Chen, he started to tightly churn lightning sea before him.</p>
 <p>Within, the Lightning Spirit furiously roared. Sending lightning liquid thousands of metres tall, it attempted to launch an assault at the bald old man once again.</p>
 <p>“Hmph.”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, the bald old man gave a cold snort. As his hands turned illusionary, the space surrounding the lightning sea suddenly distorted, while black cold air erupt from it. Transforming into an incomparably large black icy prison, the lightning sea was locked within.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Countless black lightning bolts struck the surface of the icy prison; however, it was still unable to shatter and break it apart. Previously, the bald old man was afraid of the Lightning Spirit destroying the Lightning God’s Pill upon sensing its doom; therefore, he had apprehension in using that much strength. Since the apprehension was gone now, the Lightning Spirit, which didn’t have much intelligence, was naturally not his opponent.</p>
 <p>After entrapping the Lightning Spirit, the bald old man turned around and grinned at Mu Chen, while rubbing his hands together. None of the imposing aura and manners that was able to shatter the heavens and rend the earth with each action was present in his current appearance.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen shot an unhappy glare at him. However, without dilly-dallying, a black lightning bolt appeared within the extended palm. After the lightning bolt dissipated, a Lightning God’s Pill, which was the size of a human’s head, revealed itself.</p>
 <p>One could faintly discern a countless number of minute lightning vortices present on the surface of the Lightning God’s Pill. As it continuously rotated, low and deep peals of thunder rang out.</p>
 <p>Upon taking the Lightning God’s Pill out, lightning bolts started to form within the surroundings, creating an extremely mysterious sight.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this Lightning God’s Pill, the eyes of the bald old man instantly turned red. With a grab, he took it. Even though black lightning bolts started to strike his withered palm, he did not let it move him a single inch.</p>
 <p>“The Lightning God’s Pill…”</p>
 <p>Emotions gushed out from the bald old man’s eyes. For the sake of this Lightning God’s Pill, he had been preparing for hundreds of years. Finally, today, he had achieved his wish.</p>
 <p>With this Lightning God’s Pill, he would be able to take a step forward and break the threshold of 9th Rank Sovereign, and become a true Earth Stage Sovereign!</p>
 <p>After feeling emotional for quite a while, the bald old man finally regained his calmness and stored the Lightning God’s Pill. Breaking the threshold was obviously not an easy matter. Even though he had managed to get his hands on the Lightning God’s Pill, he still needed to make lots of preparations for this attempt.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, treat this as me owing you a favor,” said the bald old man as he looked towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>With a laugh, Mu Chen replied, “Senior, you’re too polite. The benefits I’ve received are already enough. I’m afraid I can’t accept this favor.”</p>
 <p>Indeed, not only did he receive the complete version of the Lightning God Physique, he also had the Divine Black Lightning Poison Finger, as well as the Spiritual Light Empowerment he was going to receive. This amount of harvest was already incomparably abundant.</p>
 <p>“Hey. looks like the benefits that you gained are indeed quite big,” said the bald old man with an intentful smile as he shot a look at Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Seeing the look coming from the bald old man, Mu Chen instantly gave a guilty smile. With a wave of his sleeve, the lightning liquid lotus that he obtained from within the lightning sea appeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Senior, this is something that I found at the same place as the Lightning God’s Pill. However, I don’t know what it is,” explained Mu Chen as he pointed at the lightning liquid lotus.</p>
 <p>As the bald old man stared at the lightning liquid lotus, a ray of light flashed within his eyes as he replied with some shock, “This seems to be a Lightning God’s Lotus…an extremely rare Heavenly Treasure. Similar to the Lightning God’s Pill, there’s only an extremely small chance that it would be born within the lightning energies. I never imagined that this lightning sea would simultaneously give birth to the Lightning God’s Pill and this Lightning God’s Lotus…”</p>
 <p>“Lightning God’s Lotus…” Only from his explanation did Mu Chen know what this lightning liquid lotus was. From the name, one can obviously tell that it was something extraordinary.</p>
 <p>“Since this Lightning God’s Lotus was found by you, it should belong to you, too,” said the bald old man as he gestured with his hand.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen tilted his head forward. Obviously, he had never imagined that the bald old man would be that generous. After all, this Lighting God’s Lotus was not an ordinary item.</p>
 <p>“Although the Lightning God’s Lotus is also very rare, it doesn’t have much effect on the current me.”</p>
 <p>With a smile, the bald old man explained, “Your luck’s quite good. This Lightning God’s Lotus will have an extremely good effect on the training of your Lightning God’s Physique. In the future, when you practice while sitting on it, you’ll be able to absorb endless amounts of lightning energies from it to temper or fleshly body. This is extremely beneficial, since it would increase the progression of your Lightning God’s Body.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, Mu Chen felt slightly happy. This Lightning God’s Lotus had such an unexpected godly effect? He was currently worrying that his Lightning God’s Physique was too hard to practice and train. He never imagined that this Lightning God’s Lotus would help solve some of his troubles.</p>
 <p>“Then, thank you very much, Senior.” Mu Chen voiced his thanks in a sincere tone. Although it was somewhat dangerous, the benefits that he had obtained was sufficient to warrant him to undertake them. He believed that there would be countless people lunging and fighting for their lives to offer their help, should the bald old man put the word out. However, it was a pity that there weren’t many people of this level who would dare to endure the Divine Black Lightning with their bodies and survive to tell the tale…</p>
 <p>Thinking about it, if not for this point, the Northern Sea Dragon would not have come to find him.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, the bald old man gave a wave of his sleeve, grabbed Mu Chen and left the last level of the Lightning Territory to a mountain in the 9th level.</p>
 <p>The space over there wasn’t as pressurising as the previous level. Although lightning rivers were present everywhere as they floated around, it was countless times better than the last level of the Lightning Territory.</p>
 <p>“Next up…”</p>
 <p>The bald old man gave a faint smile as he looked towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>“As with my promise, I’ll help you with your Spiritual Light Empowerment.”</p>
