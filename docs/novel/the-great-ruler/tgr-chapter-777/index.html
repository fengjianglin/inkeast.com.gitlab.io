There were no noises while they travelled, since they must have clearly suppressed the noise caused by their movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two streaks of light travelled ten thousand feet in the blink of an eye before abruptly halting. With a flash of their bodies, they had landed on a mountain peak and hid their figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after hiding their figures, there were commotions that suddenly came from up ahead. Space rippled and they saw hundreds of weirdly shaped beasts flying with their roars filled with bloodlust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Cai Xiao hid as they watched the group of beast flying over and couldn’t help shaking their heads. There were too many strange beasts in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Although they had low intelligence, they possessed extremely terrifying strength due to this space that was covered with the blood essences of a True Dragon and Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they fell under their attacks, it would definitely be a huge exhaustion, even if they could escape. Therefore, the two of them could only hide whenever they encountered such large-scaled beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re not too far from that Dragon-Phoenix Pool now.” Cai Xiao said as she looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head because he had also sensed an extremely abnormal undulation from far away. That fluctuation contained a powerful pressure that even made the Spiritual Energy in Mu Chen’s body become dull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder which ferocious figure has their eyes on that Dragon-Phoenix Pool?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze lightly flickered, since he knew that there were only five known Dragon-Phoenix Pools right now, whereas there was a horrifying amount of young experts that had entered the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Therefore, one can imagine how brutal the competition for the five Dragon-Phoenix Pools would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that could get through the obstructions and reach the Dragon-Phoenix Pool were probably elites amongst the younger experts. At that time, it would definitely be an intense battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that astonishing amount of strange beasts flew past them, Mu Chen’s group of two flew out once again. In just a short half an hour, they had already encountered over ten groups of beasts. Although they had tried their best to avoid them, they still came across beasts with shocking perceptions and had no choice but to fight. Thus, it had affected their travelling speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this abnormality made Mu Chen feel relieved. It looked like they were going in the right direction. Otherwise, they wouldn’t encounter so many strange beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumour had it that when one approached the Dragon-Phoenix Pool, the guardian beasts would become more powerful. It looked like they could not afford to let their guards down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this cautiousness, they managed to get through the journey. The two of them flew across a mountain range, before stopping on an isolated peak. They directed their gazes over, before suddenly narrowing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What appeared before their gazes was a collapsed land with a deep abyss of ravines crisscrossed. That ferocious scene clearly indicated that this place had undergone a heavens-shocking battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And at this moment, the centre of the collapsed land was a lofty hill that reached through the clouds. Vaguely, it was pale white in colour, but upon clearer inspection, it was actually a huge mountain of bones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were too many bones piling together, which formed a huge bone mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were ancient runes that could be seen on the bone mountain. Those runes were slightly fanning out, as if they were alive, along with a terrifying pressure that was being emitted from the bone mountain, which would send shivers down the spine of others who looked at it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dragon-Phoenix Pool should be on top of that bone mountain.” Mu Chen looked at the peak of the bone mountain, which was lingering with clouds. Clearly, the pressure coming from there was the most intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao’s charming gaze looked upon the collapsed land and the mountain of bones, then lightly said, “Looks like there’s quite a number of people here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. He had also sensed many Spiritual Energy fluctuations on this vast land. The amount couldn’t be considered as less. It looked like those that made it to this Dragon-Phoenix Pool were quite capable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll wait and see. The Dragon-Phoenix Pool is just right before us. But I’m afraid that it won’t be so easy for us to dip our finger in it,” said Mu Chen. He had not lost his rationale just because of the Dragon-Phoenix Pool, since he knew that the most dangerous things were all closest to the treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon-Phoenix Haven was filled in danger everywhere. It’s not easy to make it here, not to mention obtaining the Dragon-Phoenix Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao wasn’t surprised about Mu Chen’s calmness. After a few days of interaction, she had already understood that Mu Chen was a youth whose wisdom and composure far exceeded the norm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, clearly, not everyone could maintain such composure when facing treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Mu Chen’s group of two appeared here not too long ago, there were figures appearing in the sky far away. Every single one of them was undoubtedly fluctuating with powerful Spiritual Energy ripples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be capable of passing through the obstructions of those strange beasts and reach the Dragon-Phoenix Pool, they definitely weren’t mediocre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This group was roughly numbered in a hundred. They also clearly understood the danger that filled the White Bones Mountain, so they did not make any rash actions and had formed an alliance to enter together. This way, even if they faced danger, they would be able to join hands together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hundred streaks of light swiftly flew, dispersed and headed towards the White Bones Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen quietly watched this scene and lightly narrowed his eyes, before he heard a sharp cry that had abruptly resonated from the White Bones Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Auuuuwww!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, when the cry resounded, the White Bones Mountain seemed to have violently trembled. In the next instant, the White Bones Mountain shook as cracks spread out with an overwhelming amount of white figures flying out from those cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were more than ten young experts that were the fastest, so they were instantly enveloped by hundreds of white figures as their sharp claws tore through space, pouncing towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reaction of those fellows wasn’t slow as well, Spiritual Energy immediately burst out and formed into all sorts of defences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tsssssii!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, those defences did not protect their lives as they had expected. Those claws were covered in black scales that had instantly tore through the layers of Spiritual Energy defences before swiping across without any emotions. Instantly, fresh blood spewed out as those dozens of young experts issued miserable shrieks, before they were split into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arghhh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miserable shrieks also resounded from the other direction at this instant and those hundred young experts had frantically retreated with fear on their faces. However, nearly half of them were torn apart in several breaths’ time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What terrifying beasts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s wore a grave expression at this scene as his gaze flickered. He had managed to take a clear look at those white figures. They were pale-white ape beasts with figures that were roughly a few feet in size. Their huge claws were black in colour, covered in layers of dense scales, which reflected heart-palpitating chilling light under the shine of sunlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, they had a pair of bone wings on their back, which bestowed them terrifying speed.</span></p>

Initially, there wasn’t anything special about this place, but because of the death of the True Dragon and Phoenix in this location, and with some special conditions added in, it had given birth to these powerful beasts that didn’t have a high intelligence.</span></p>

Those beasts might merely have the strength of First and Second Grade Sovereigns, but they were large in numbers and came in such an overwhelming way that they made the hearts of others go numb from watching.</span></p>

The overlapping amount seemed to have covered the entire White Bones Mountain.</span></p>

Although those white apes are powerful, they might not be able to stop us if we act together.” Finally, a meticulous person said, with his voice ringing across the horizon, while being wrapped in Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
