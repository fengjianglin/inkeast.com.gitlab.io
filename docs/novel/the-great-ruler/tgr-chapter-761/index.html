 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Mu Chen’s surroundings were fluctuating with powerful Spiritual Energy undulations. His black pupils were as abstruse as the starry sky, emitting spiritual light as astonishing Spiritual Energy fluctuations were emitted from his every action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, he was much stronger compared to three months ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the nine grades of Sovereigns, there was a huge gap between every grade. Normally whenever someone wanted to break through a grade, they would have to fork out much bitter cultivation. Although Mu Chen had the help of the bizarre energy of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond, it was still shocking by the fact that he could make a breakthrough within a few months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He actually succeeded?” Bing Qing and the Commanders of the Great Havenlaw Army were looking at Mu Chen in shock. Clearly, they felt that it was a little tough to believe that Mu Chen could break through in just three months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Greatlaw Blaze Pond was greatly beneficial to cultivation, it was not to this extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky when Nine Nether saw this scene, a smear of a smile appeared on the corner of her lips. She did not feel shocked, since she had already gotten used to the multiple miracles that Mu Chen had created all these years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any ripple in Mandala’s eyes. She waved her hand and moved everyone onto the stone platform of the Great Havenlaw Army, where the warriors of the troop immediately bowed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We pay our greetings to the Ruler.” Huo Mei’er had also bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala waved her hand. Although she had the appearance of a little girl, no one dared to be disrespectful just because of her appearance. That oppressive pressure leaked by the casual movements of an Earth Sovereign expert was fearful to ordinary Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you have brought back a pretty good sprout this time, Nine Nether.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er chuckled as she looked at Nine Nether, who was standing behind Mandala, and let out a pampered laughter. “I am very interested in Mu Chen. Why don’t you give him to my Great Havenlaw Army, I will agree to all your conditions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Huo Mei’er, Nine Nether found it a little reminiscing, but upon hearing her words, Nine Nether’s face instantly turned cold. Before she could even talk, Huo Mei’er moved closer as she chuckled, “Looks like you’re very unwilling. But that fellow is pretty good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether rolled her eyes and couldn’t be bothered to talk anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s golden pupils looked at Mu Chen, before lightly nodding her head. “Your deadline of three months is up. If you want to represent the Great Havenlaw Domain and participate in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, then you have to get through the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the words “Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array”, Nine Nether’s brows slightly knitted for a brief moment as she looked at Mu Chen with slight worry. It wasn’t an unfamiliar name for her and she was clear of its power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array is so powerful that even Fourth Grade Sovereigns will have a tough time getting through it. Therefore… do you still dare to attempt it?” Mandala looked at Mu Chen as she slowly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the numerous gazes, Mu Chen had also raised his eyes. He stepped on the magma as a smear of a smile appeared on his handsome face, before he cupped his fists and calmly said, “Please set the array, Ruler.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth had a calm expression. There wasn’t any fear, despite knowing the great danger. His mental state attracted quite a bit of admiration from the experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To have his name widely spread in the Great Havenlaw Domain in such a short time, that youth was indeed praiseworthy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, there were some people that inwardly smacked their lips as well, a majority of them were the warriors of the Great Havenlaw Army. It was so much so that even Bing Qing and the other Commanders had no comment for Mu Chen’s confidence. They weren’t belittling Mu Chen, it was just that their understanding towards the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array had surpassed others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, when they barged the array, every single one of them had experienced numerous failures before their success. Furthermore, their strengths were much stronger than Mu Chen’s when they attempted it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had gone through multiple failures, wanting Mu Chen to get through with one attempt was a little too whimsical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala wasn’t bothered about those gazes. She lightly nodded her head upon seeing that Mu Chen was done adjusting his state. “Since you have no intentions on retreating, then we will do as you wish. As long as you can get past the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array, then I will allow you to become the sixth Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment those words left her mouth, it instantly caused an uproar. The Great Havenlaw Army was the strongest troop in the Great Havenlaw Domain, directly under the command of the Ruler and could be considered as one of Great Havenlaw Domain’s trump cards. Not even the various Kings could get their hands on it. But no one had expected that the Ruler would actually allow Mu Chen to become the sixth Commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light flickered in the eyes of the various Kings, before looking at Mu Chen in envy and wondered why the Ruler would treat Mu Chen so well in their hearts. Previously, she had even offended the Sky Profound Palace for him, and right now, she had the intention of nurturing him as a Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er and the rest were a little astonished, but they did not doubt Mandala’s words. After all, if Mu Chen could truly get past the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array, he would barely qualify as a Commander in the Great Havenlaw Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether did not speak as well because even if Mu Chen became the Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army, he could still command the Nine Nether Troop. So she wished for Mu Chen to succeed instead. After all, the Great Havenlaw Army was very strong indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala finished her words, she waved her hand and everyone instantly felt a terrifying undulation coming from the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond. Thereafter, they witnessed the magma ocean in the Greatlaw Blaze Pond rising at a stunning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Magma rolled as if there were thousands of waves rumbling in the abyss. Even the entire volcano was slightly vibrating from the huge force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Greatlaw Blaze Pond was constantly expanding, pillars of magma that were a thousand feet high rose into the sky, forming into massive rivers of magma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As those rivers were rolling, they had split apart, forming into a sea of magma in the sky. There were scarlet magma runes that were constantly rising in the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those magma runes swiftly converged together and the violent roars of dragons resounded. A scarlet light rose as nine massive dragons that couldn’t be fully seen were formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those nine dragons were red in colour and they coiled in the sea of magma with magma flowing on their massive bodies. The terrifying oppressive pressure that was emitted from their bodies made many experts’ faces change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s because they could sense how powerful those dragons were. The most important point was that those dragons weren’t illusions. The genuine oppressive pressure that belonged to the Dragon Clan was emanating from their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those dragons aren’t illusions, they’re formed from the Primordial Fire Dragon’s blood essence that flows in the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond, by chance.” Mandala looked at Mu Chen and her tender voice resounded with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen wore a grave expression. Every single one of those nine massive magma dragons had violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations emanating from them. With the nine of them, not even Fourth Grade Sovereigns would dare to confront them head-on. With such power, it was no wonder why it could become the trial for Commanders in the Great Havenlaw Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The array is already prepared. If you are done making your preparations, then you can step in. But upon entering, you can only depend on your own power. Even if you’re in a life-and-death situation, there will not be anyone rendering help to you. In all these years, there isn’t a lack in those that have died in it.”</span></p>

He could sense the dangerous fluctuations coming from the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array. But just this alone was still not enough to make him cower.</span></p>

He turned into a streak of light as he charged straightly towards the magma sea that was emitting a terrifying pressure.</span></p>

It looked like a mountain that wanted to crush him into dust.</span></p>

The demonic pillar swept down, casting a huge shadow that enveloped one of the magma dragons.</span></p>
