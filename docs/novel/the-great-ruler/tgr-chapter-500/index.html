He finally understood the origin of the weird feeling he was having. From the tone and manner of Wen Qingxuan’s words, she clearly had a special thought towards Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems that there is a special… rival in love popping out?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Noticing Mu Chen’s strange gaze, Wen Qingxuan showed not one bit of being offended. On the contrary, she revealed an alluring and soul-stirring smile towards him. This smile had the charm that could cause the downfall of a country, causing Mu Chen to give a sigh of helplessness within his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pretty lady, why do you want to head down this path?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan held Luo Li’s hands in a confident and natural manner. Being exceedingly close to Luo Li, the exquisite figures of the two girls appeared to be pasted together, clearly showing the extreme intimacy between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li also felt slightly flabbergasted by such intimacy shown by Wen Qingxuan. Nevertheless, she clearly didn’t think about any weird ideas from this. Therefore, despite being slightly uncomfortable, she didn’t reject this intimacy. She had no lack of a favorable view towards Wen Qingxuan, as the latter was similarly outstanding, while possessing an extremely free and unconstrained character. These traits were extremely hard to be found on ordinary girls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, although Luo Li didn’t mind it, Mu Chen felt jealousy and envy brewing within him. With a dry cough, he extended his hands to grab onto Luo Li’s snow-white wrist, before pulling her away. Stepping forward, he separated Luo Li from Wen Qingxuan, before saying with a smile, “ Captain Wen Qingxuan, when do we take action?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen barging in, Wen Qingxuan could not help rolling her eyes towards him. Twirling a lock of her hair in her hand, she said in an indifferent tone, “Naturally, as soon as possible. As of now, all six Divine Quotas have landed in the hands of people, and they should also know about the location of the Divine Wood Palace. Therefore, they would head there at full force. This Divine Wood Palace remnant isn’t like any ordinary remnant. There are quite a few inheritances within it. As long as you obtain one of them, it would allow your group’s strength to drastically increase. Therefore, there’s no one who would be willing to give up on such an opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slightly nodding his head, Mu Chen muttered, “Of the other five Divine Quotas, whose hands did they land in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to what I know, the Academy Alliance should have one, while the people from the Saint Spiritual Academy and the Martial Spiritual Academy have each gotten one… as for remaining two, I’m not too sure. However, as to the people who are able to obtain and hold on to those Divine Quotas, I believe that no one would believe that those people don’t possess an adequate level of strength. Therefore, the groups that would contest for the Divine Wood Palace remnant would naturally be rather strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising her phoenix-like eyes to look into the distance, Wen Qingxuan continued speaking, “The Great Spiritual Academy Tournament has already started to entered its heated phase. Those powerful groups that are hiding in the dark are all starting to reveal themselves in succession. The Great Spiritual Academy Tournament this time is even tougher than previous times as god-knows how many crouching tigers and hidden dragons there are within this tournament. Even I don’t have absolute confidence in achieving the championship. If not, I wouldn’t come to find you guys to collaborate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are four leaders within the Academy Alliance; of which, three of them are known by me. Each of them are quite strong and aren’t easy to deal with. Furthermore, all of them have rather splendid combat results, with even experts of Spiritual Energy Disaster suffering defeat in their hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen’s forehead immediately twitched.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Being able to defeat experts of Spiritual Energy Disaster…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the looks of it, the three leaders of the Academy Alliance really do possess some ability. In this current phase of the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, experts of Spiritual Energy Disaster were already able to dominate fights by themselves. As for people who were able to even defeat them, this showed what peak level they were in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s still one more leader?” asked Mu Chen in doubt. It seemed that Wen Qingxuan had only talked about three of the aforementioned leaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Head Leader of the Academy Alliance is exceedingly mysterious. Furthermore, he’s the creator of this Academy Alliance. I’ve yet to see his true face. However, being able to let the other three wild and untamable Heads elect him as their Head, I’m afraid that this person should be a formidable opponent to deal with,” replied Wen Qingxuan with a slight frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen nodded his head, his expression turning solemn. From the looks of it, the matter of this Divine Wood Palace remnant truly would not be easy. Even someone as arrogant as Wen Qingxuan appeared to be that vigilant and cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The people from the Saint Spiritual Academy… was it Ji Xuan and his group?” Suddenly, Mu Chen’s eyes slightly flashed as he shot out a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not too sure about this, but each of the four Great Holy Sons of the Saint Spiritual Academy head their own teams. Of them, there are two that needs to be paid attention to,” replied Wen Qingxuan as she looked towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Mu Chen appeared exceedingly interested as he listened. Clearly, Wen Qingxuan’s information was much more accurate than theirs, to actually be able to get such a deep understanding of the Saint Spiritual Academy’s four Great Holy Sons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From the surface, there isn’t any seperation of the four Great Holy Sons. However, that isn’t true… Among the four, Great Holy Son Wang Zhong is undoubtedly the strongest. As for the other one, it is Ji Xuan. He’s the one among the four Great Holy Sons that have the least experience. However, at the same time, he’s the one whose depths are deep and unmeasurable. I think that you should know about this point, right?” replied Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Holy Son Wang Zhong…” muttered Mu Chen as his eyes slightly narrowed. He had crossed hands with one of the four Holy Sons, Xia Hou, even causing serious injuries to the latter. From what he could see, other than Ji Xuan, he had assumed that the other Holy Sons should not be much apart in strength from one another. However, after hearing those words from Wen Qingxuan, he should pay more attention to this Wang Zhong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for the Saint Spiritual Academy group that would appear in the Divine Wood Palace, there’s a very high possibility that it could be either Wang Zhong or Ji Xuan in their lead…” replied Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen slightly nodded his head. Regardless of Wang Zhong or Ji Xuan, both of them are exceedingly thorny opponents. From the looks of it, this Divine Wood Palace really would become extremely lively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take your Divine Quota out. We should be making our move now.” Not wanting to talk lany onger, Wen Qingxuan looked towards Mu Chen and spoke out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not hesitating, Mu Chen clenched his hand, causing the Divine Wood Plaque to appear within. Activating his Spiritual Energy, the Divine Wood Plaque instantly radiated with emerald-green rays of brilliance. After starting to slowly vibrate, it pointed towards the northwest direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Northwest, huh?” Looking towards the shown direction, Wen Qingxuan gave a slight nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Storing the Divine Wood Plaque, Mu Chen gave a huge wave of his hand, before taking the lead. Shooting out, he transformed into a beam of light, with Luo Li, Xu Huang and the other two immediately following suit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let us get on our way, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a faint smile, Wen Qingxuan took the lead, and headed out as the exquisite young girls followed behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fragment of the Shattered Continent was exceedingly vast. Although it was only a fragment of the entire Shattered Continent, it was not inferior in size to the Northern Heavens Continent. Therefore, even after heading on their way for five continuous days, they were still unable to reach the location indicated by the Divine Wood Plaque.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, during their five-day journey, Mu Chen and the rest were able to clearly sense a gradually change as the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament ramped towards the climax. Along the way, they had seen far too many fights. There were large-scale ones and small ones, with the largest having hundreds of groups duking it out in a radius that seemed to spread over a thousand kilometres. The rampant Spiritual Energy fluctuations caused even the entire world to change colour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faced against those fights, Mu Chen and the rest only observed from the side with a detached point-of-view, not interfering with any of them while heading along their journey. He didn’t have the slightest bit of thought towards the possibility of obtaining such a gigantic amount of points as he knew that it was still not the time to take action just for the sake of points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Mu Chen didn’t go out to provoke those groups, there were similarly no groups that came out to provoke them. Naturally, the greatest reason was due to Wen Qingxuan travelling beside them. Faced against the tyrannically powerful group placed first in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, there was clearly no one that dared to recklessly provoke them. However, Wen Qingxuan and her group were attracting too much attention…</span></p>

Finally, Mu Chen and the rest were getting near their targeted location. That’s because Mu Chen was able to sense the Divine Wood Plaque in his hands emitting increasingly bright rays of brilliance. Faintly, he could also sense it gradually turning warm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The remnant of the Divine Wood Palace is very likely at the ancient mountain range two thousand kilometres away from us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing on a mountain peak, Mu Chen held the Divine Wood Plaque as he said that. Looking towards the horizon in the northwest direction, he said with a smile, “According to the speed we’re travelling at, we should be able to reach there by tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This should be considered as the central location of this fragment of the Shattered Continent,” said Luo Li in a soft voice as she scanned the surroundings with her beautiful eyes. “The groups that have appeared here are getting increasingly stronger… I believe that the location where the Divine Wood Palace remnant have already attracted many groups to converge at its location.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen nodded his head. Along the way, they had seen quite a few groups that were heading along the same direction as them. Clearly, the location of the Divine Wood Palace remnant had already been revealed by other people. This would mean that when it came time to harvest the treasures present within it, it would clearly be even more chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There should be a transaction base located 5 hundred kilometres in front of us. We might be able to temporarily stop there. This transaction base should be the largest one within a radius of tens of thousands of kilometres. There will be a lot of groups converging there, with quite a few genuine good things present there, especially some Combat Spirit Pills. I think that we should need some of those,” said Wen Qingxuan as she looked into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Combat Spirit Pills… that’s too luxurious,” replied Mu Chen as he rubbed his nose. Those Spirit Pills that were able to increase one’s combat strength or increase recovery of Spiritual Energy were exceedingly expensive. Wanting to exchange for them would absolutely require an exorbitant price. He really did want to acquire some of them. However, they were truly luxurious items, things that not just anyone could afford.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As if I’ve asked you to pay,” said Wen Qingxuan as she rolled her eyes towards Mu Chen. Proceeding to ignore him, with a shift of her exquisite figure, she took the lead and shot off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Helplessly shrugging his shoulders, Mu Chen brought along the rest as they chased after her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five hundred kilometers wouldn’t take much time for Mu Chen and the rest. As mountain after mountain shot by beneath their feet, they could feel countless Spiritual Energy fluctuations suddenly appearing in the distance before them. Raising their heads, they could see countless beams of light, hiding the skies and covering the earth as they shot by, finally landing in the ground in the distance skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Present in this area was a somewhat large town that had clearly appeared not long ago, quietly sitting on the ground. It was precisely this town that those countless beams of light had landed in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, this should be the so-called “transaction base” that Wen Qingxuan had spoken about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the luxurious little town, slight curiosity rose within Mu Chen, before hwas about to lead everyone to descend with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as he made a move, he discovered that Luo Li had suddenly come to a halt. At this moment, faint chilling intent surfaced from her faintly smiling beautiful face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Striding in front of Mu Chen, Luo Li’s ice-cold gaze shot towards a mountain peak in the distance. A dozen figures were faintly discernible as Mu Chen cast his gaze over, causing wrinkles to appear on his forehead. There seemed to be two to three groups present there, with those people appearing exceedingly unfamiliar. However, blood-red robes were wore by each and every one of them, causing them to appear exceedingly glaring and striking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fluctuations that caused Mu Chen to feel somewhat uncomfortable were radiating from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the matter?” asked Wen Qingxuan in a soft voice, having also noticed the blood robe-dressed groups that seemed to be also looking over towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly clenching her Luo God Sword tightly, Luo Li looked towards Mu Chen, before replying in a slow manner, “They’re people from the Blood God Clan.”</span></p>
