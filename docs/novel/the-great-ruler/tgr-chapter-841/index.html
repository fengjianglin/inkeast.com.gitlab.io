 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This head disciple of the Ancient Haven Palace’s Fourth Hall Master had completely disappeared from the world without any trace left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the spot that Xiao Qingyun disappeared from, Mu Chen felt a little pity. Judging from the information leaked by the latter, Mu Chen could tell how colossal the Ancient Haven Palace was in the Primordial Age. The Seven Hall Masters were probably Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses, and the Palace Master must definitely have been a genuine Heavenly Sovereign powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, such a terrifyingly powerful force had fallen in the end. So one could tell how terrifying the Fiends were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a war that affected the entire planet and someone at Mu Chen’s strength could not imagine it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing beside him, Nine Nether smiled as she saw the atmosphere becoming a little serious. “There’s no need to think so much about it. No matter how powerful the Fiends were, our Great Thousand World is still standing up till now. Our pinnacle powerhouses have been on high alert towards them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head in agreement. It was a groundless fear for him to think about that with his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, there’s no more Fallen Origin Aura in this Grade-3 Ruin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether waved her hand and stored all the Fallen Origin Pellets with a happy smile on her face. “Altogether, we have gotten more than 300 Fallen Origin Pellets, a harvest that far exceeds ordinary Grade-3 Ruins.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. Generally speaking, the amount of Fallen Origin Pellets that could be extracted from a Grade-3 Ruin should be around a hundred. But they were pretty lucky and encountered Xiao Qingyun, whose body was infected with the Evil Aura. Although he was in the Ninth Grade Sovereign Realm when he was alive, his strength had diminished with the passing of time. But the Fallen Origin Aura in his body was more perfectly preserved compared to the other experts in this ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, those Fallen Origin Pellets weren’t much of a surprise, compared to the Spiritual Compass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled with his eyes narrowed as he tossed the black compass. As long as they had this compass, they would have an advantage in searching for ruins and extracting Fallen Origin Pellets. This was basically comparable to a Divine Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them looked around at this completely destroyed ruin and no longer stayed here. They flew and turned into two bolts of lightning as they exited this wetland.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the wetland, the Nine Nether Troop was like a black tidal wave as they spread out and watched their surroundings with caution, firmly clenching onto the halberds in their hands with their bodies tensed like cheetahs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were even silhouettes of the Nine Nether Troop in the distant mountains. Clearly, they were monitoring this region to prevent any unexpected situation that could disturb Mu Chen and Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two streaks of light flew out of the wetland and appeared above the Nine Nether Troop. Joy flushed on the faces of the Nine Nether Troop and they immediately bowed in salutation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did any other force come close?” Mu Chen looked at Qiu Shan. The latter was initially a top-notch expert in the Nine Nether Troop, and the resources from the Nine Nether Palace in the past year had swiftly promoted his strength. He was currently a Second Grade Sovereign, promoted to Captain in the Nine Nether Troop, along with three other top-notch warriors to train the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Shan, whose figure was like a tower, immediately cupped his fists. “Reporting back to Commander. Earlier on, there were some forces that tried to approach but were chased away by us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded in satisfaction. Although he and Nine Nether weren’t present, the Nine Nether Troop was much stronger than the time when he had just joined the Nine Nether Palace. Therefore, ordinary forces wouldn’t dare to provoke them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Palace Master, Commander, where are we going next?” Qiu Shan looked at Mu Chen and Nine Nether with fighting intent filling his eyes. For the past year, the resources granted to them by the Nine Nether Palace had greatly enhanced their strength. He also knew the logic behind the phase of ‘Nurturing soldiers for a thousand days and only fighting for a single day’. Right now, the Hunting War was the moment for them to exhibit their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They would let Mu Chen and Nine Nether know that the huge amount of resources spent on them weren’t wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled in response. This place was the boundary to the map that Mandala had given them. If they were to go as according to their previous plan, they would be like flies travelling around randomly and see if they could discover other ruins by luck. But, fortunately, their plan changed now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s time to test this thing out.” Mu Chen smiled with his eyes narrowed as he retrieved the black Spiritual Compass, before injecting his Spiritual Energy within it. Instantly, complex runes appeared on the surface of the Spiritual Compass, before it bloomed with light. It seemed to be an exquisite Spiritual Energy screen with lines that outlined the terrains that were constantly spreading out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether nervously looked at the map. This item was left with Xiao Qingyun for tens of thousands of years, so they didn’t know if it still worked. If it was damaged, then their joy would have been for nought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qiu Shan and the rest saw the two’s actions, they were baffled as they exchanged looks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time gradually passed, the ring of light on the compass was still continuing to spread out. There weren’t any unusual events that made Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s face to look even slightly bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when they were about to be disappointed, the black compass trembled and a red dot suddenly appeared on the screen that was still constantly flickering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s something!” Mu Chen’s eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen’s voice rang out, another light appeared further away from the red dot. Furthermore, the density of the light was even stronger than the former.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This all just happened in a short moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If such an exploration speed was known to the other forces, their eyes would probably turn red. With such an exploration Divine Artifact, the task of extracting Fallen Origin Pellets was as easy as stretching a hand to grab it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether both had their faces filled with pleasant surprise. They did not hesitate in the slightest as they led the entire Nine Nether Troop out of this wetland, towards the location marked on the Spiritual Compass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, other forces had retreated with caution when they saw the Nine Nether Troop’s formation. Clearly, they were intimidated by the torrential fighting intent emitted by the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those decently strong forces did not wish to fight head-on with the Nine Nether Troop and chose to retreat. Although the Nine Nether Troop was nothing to fear, the Great Havenlaw Domain that stood behind it was a genuine peak force. Therefore, it was impossible for those forces not to feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to various reasons, their journey was unexpectedly smooth. Although there would be some occasional obstructions, that didn’t pose too much of a danger to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they had already reached the first ruin marked on the Spiritual Compass two hours later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were a little disappointed, since this ruin wasn’t as strong as the ruin that they had found earlier. It couldn’t even be classified as a Grade-3 Ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were a little disappointed, the meat of a mosquito was still meat. It was better than them painfully searching for ruins and couldn’t even find one. With such a thought, Mu Chen’s group swept through the ruin and extracted the Fallen Origin Pellets in this ruin, which amounted to over fifty Fallen Origin Pellets.</span></p>

But that ruin did not leave Mu Chen disappointed, since the Fallen Origin Aura had reached the level of Grade-3 Ruin.</span></p>

It was a force called the Ironblood Warsect. They could be considered as a top-quality force and the entire sect was extremely fond of battle. Therefore, they liked expeditions the most, and even many forces in the Northern Region had feared their existence.</span></p>

But just when Mu Chen had refined the Spirit of Battle Will and was prepared to battle, the Commander of the Ironblood Troop had directly ordered to disperse and retreat. As the Commander retreated, his curses even resounded over from afar.</span></p>

It was exactly what he wished for, avoiding a direct confrontation with the Ironblood Warsect. But from the performance of the Ironblood Warsect, they didn’t seem to be as described according to rumours, to be fond of battle to the point of insanity. Therefore, they still sensibly retreated after knowing that they would have to pay a huge price if they fought.</span></p>

Altogether, they already had around 600 Fallen Origin Pellets.</span></p>

After all, it was extremely rare to be able to find a Grade-3 Ruin in such a short time. Especially when other forces also possessed means that could read Fallen Origin Aura.</span></p>

It was the token that Mandala had given to the ten Kings before the Hunting War started.</span></p>
