 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone heard Mu Chen’s words, there was a slight change in their expressions but they did not speak a word. Their gazes remained on the latter and saw that Mu Chen was smiling. “I believe everyone has weighed the pros and cons. No matter what, the Glacier King is still a King of our Great Havenlaw Domain. If we allow him to be executed before the other forces, it will be a disastrous blow to our reputation if we allowed an expert of ours to be humiliated in this way and do nothing. It will undoubtedly make the hearts of others turn cold.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This action from the Netherworld Palace is trying to ruin our morale. After all, if this matter was the spread out, the forces of the Great Havenlaw Domain will undoubtedly be depressed. With the final battle approaching, our fighting strength will also be affected if the morale of our warriors drops.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we do nothing, it will go as the Netherworld Palace planned.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the Asura King and the other Kings grew even more grave as they gently nodded their heads. They had also sensed the ruthlessness in the Netherworld Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But, I’m afraid that the Netherworld Palace will not let us rescue him so easily. The bigger possibility is to dig a hole for us to jump in,” said Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With the Netherworld Palace’s strength, it’s impossible for them to devour us without the presence of top experts. So they can’t accomplish it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s black pupils flashed as he gently said, “Since it’s a gathering, they must have also invited the Divine Pavilion and the Sky Profound Palace, since they have a bad relation with us. If the three of them joined together, they might actually be able to bury us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, even the Asura King’s face couldn’t help changing. If three peak forces were to have such intentions, then the situation would be extremely unfavourable for their Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, are we still going to rescue him?” Someone couldn’t help frowning. The Netherworld Palace was truly sinister to force them into such a difficult situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the Netherworld Palace can find someone to help them, why can’t we?” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Kings all exchanged looks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Netherworld Palace has killed the Battle Will genius of the Demon Gate, so the grudge between the two forces is extremely heavy. I have previously gotten into an agreement with them. If we’re to deal with the Netherworld Palace, they’re willing to cooperate with us. The Myriad Saint Peak also has some grudges with the Divine Pavilion. If the Divine Pavilion joins with them, it’s not hard for us to get the Myriad Saint Peak to join up with us. This way, we will not have to fear the three of them joining forces.” Mu Chen slowly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have already gotten into an agreement with the Demon Gate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s words, even the Asura King couldn’t help having a surprise on his face, while the other Kings were all shocked. After all, in the Hunting War, where they are all opponents, it’s hard for a cooperation to be facilitated. But Mu Chen was actually able to cooperate with the Demon Gate, which had exceeded their expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head with a smile. “It’s hard for a cooperation to be done in the Hunting War. We’re all in it for our own benefits. Isn’t it the same for the Divine Pavilion and Sky Profound Palace for them to cooperate with the Netherworld Palace? It’s to get rid of our Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Asura King nodded his head as he briefly pondered, before sweeping his gaze out. “Then, do the other Kings have any other opinions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mountain Splitting King and the rest shook their heads. Since there’s a decision, then they would naturally not fear the Netherworld Palace. After all, the Netherworld Palace’s tyrant actions had enraged the higher hierarchy of the Great Havenlaw Domain. If they were to suck it up, how was their Great Havenlaw Domain going to have a footing in the Northern Region in the future?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay. Since that’s the case, then issue the orders. We will move out to the Bones Mountain Range three days from now. Let us see how big of an appetite the Netherworld Palace has. Let’s see if they can devour our entire Great Havenlaw Domain!” The Asura King revealed a cold smile as he coldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other Kings heard his words, they had all heavily nodded their heads. They had practically gathered the required amount of Fallen Origin Pellets, so they could only wait for the orders of Mandala and the three Emperors. Since the Netherworld Palace dared to climb over their heads, they had to let them know that there’s no one that didn’t have to pay a price for doing so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Mu is already a Battle Formation Master, right?” Seeing the raging atmosphere around everyone, the Asura King smiled and his gaze suddenly shifted towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the Asura King’s gaze, Mu Chen felt uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. It’s said that King Mu has already helped Mountain Splitting King and the rest’s troops to refine the Spirits of Battle Will, right?” The Asura King smiled with his eyes squinted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other Kings heard those words, their eyes beamed as they looked at Mu Chen with drooling eyes. Their intentions were abundantly clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But regarding this matter, there’s no reason for Mu Chen to deny it. He straightforwardly smiled. “If everyone trusts me, then you can leave your troops with me to refine the Spirits of Battle Will. But there’s some shortcuts in this Spirit of Battle Will, so you guys need to be aware of that beforehand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What he spoke was naturally having him refine the Spirit of Battle Will, so there would be his imprint left behind. So if those troops wanted to deal with him, he only needed a single thought to greatly damage their Battle Wills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But despite knowing that, the Asura King and the rest weren’t bothered about it. “King Mu can go ahead and do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not think that there’s a need for them to use their troops against Mu Chen one day. If that really happened, then the Great Havenlaw Domain would probably be in chaos. So, at that time, no one would be bothered about this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing their approvals, Mu Chen smiled as he nodded. “Leave it to me. For the next three days, I will refine the Spirits of Battle Will of your troops and return them to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his current strength as a Ten Thousand Rune Battle Formation Master, it wasn’t hard for him to refine the Spirits of Battle Will for their troops. But once those Spirits of Battle Will left his control, there would definitely be a great decrease in the might that their troops could unleash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But regardless of how weak they were, they were still stronger compared than they were now. If the fighting power of their troops could increase even a little bit, they might be able to decrease their casualties. After all, nurturing those troops required a large amount of energy and resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for your trouble, King Mu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other Kings saw Mu Chen’s agreement, they all rejoiced and immediately cupped their hands in thanks. At this moment, they knew why the Mountain Splitting King and the rest were all so polite to Mu Chen. Even the Blood Hawk King, who had grudges with Nine Nether and Mu Chen, was so polite, so they couldn’t belittle Mu Chen’s identity as a Battle Formation Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen naturally smiled and responded their gratitude with his hands cupped together. He wasn’t arrogant just because of his identity as a Battle Formation Master, which made the Asura King and the rest inwardly nod their heads. Although Mu Chen was young, him not acting proud made them have a good feeling about him. Their past thoughts that Mu Chen was young and inexperienced to be ranked together with them had all been wiped away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not rely on Mandala and Nine Nether for him to come this far, he had relied on his own strength and hard work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the next three days, the Great Havenlaw Domain had reorganised their troops. Every single troop had a boost in their morale, especially since the sinister schemes that the Netherworld Palace had for the Great Havenlaw Domain had made every single expert to be enraged. They were naturally proud that they could be a member of the Great Havenlaw Domain. But right now, the Netherworld Palace had clearly captured the Glacier King to execute him in front of others, they were clearly intending to climb over their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it was natural that their Great Havenlaw Domain couldn’t endure this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single expert of the Great Havenlaw Domain had bore a breath to meet the force of the Netherworld Palace. The so-called “gathering” had also been brewed over the past three days, before it spread into the ears of every single force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the entire inner section, there were naturally some commotions being caused by it. Especially those that were well-informed about the Glacier King having been captured by the Netherworld Palace. Many of them were shocked. The so-called “gathering” was probably an execution site, but was the Great Havenlaw Domain so easy to kill off?</span></p>
