When everyone felt it, there was a dreadful pressure coming from that pillar of light. That pressure wasn’t unfamiliar to them, they had sensed it from those Sovereign Realm Elders in the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evidently, the person within that pillar of light had successfully broken through to the Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a particular peak in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong raised their heads as they looked at the direction of the light pillar with complicated gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow is truly a monster.” Shen Cangsheng bitterly smiled. There was a hint of admiration in his eyes, along with unwillingness. Back then, when he met Mu Chen, the latter was still being chased after by Mo Xingtian. But in just three years, that youth had already far surpassed him, taking the lead and stepping into the Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Xuantong nodded his head in agreement, his thoughts were deeper than Shen Cangsheng’s. After all, Mu Chen was just someone that had managed to take three of his moves with all his strength and felt that Mu Chen was only ordinary back then and wasn’t a fitting match for the outstanding Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in less than merely three years, he witnessed how Mu Chen soared and dazzled. Right now, Li Xuantong had no choice but to admit that Luo Li’s eyesight truly was good. Although when Luo Li left, and Luo Tiansheng wasn’t entirely satisfied with Mu Chen, Li Xuantong, who had witnessed Mu Chen’s growth, knew that there would be a day when Luo Tianshen will change his opinion of Mu Chen, just like how he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was the youth that could always produce stunning miracles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid that Mu Chen won’t be staying long in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.” Shen Cangsheng suddenly said with reluctance in his tone. After spending so much time, he had a favourable impression of Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about you?” Li Xuantong looked at Shen Cangsheng, he knew that this man before him was filled with pride down to his bones. It was impossible for him to stay in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will begin my secluded cultivation, in an attempt to break through to the Sovereign Realm shortly. At that time, I will roam around the Great Thousand World. Haha, who knows, I might be able to encounter Mu Chen at that time. If there’s a chance, I will definitely have a spar with him to determine who will be stronger at that time.” Shen Cangsheng smiled with blazing fighting intent and expectation in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go at that time, I might be faster than you in entering the Sovereign Realm.” Li Xuantong spoke with a smear of a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, it’s not that easy for you to surpass me! do you think you’re Mu Chen?” Shen Cangsheng laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, we’ll wait and see.” Li Xuantong smiled. His gaze was gentle. He had treated Shen Cangsheng as an opponent that could be comparable to himself and saw how lacking he was. As for Mu Chen, that fellow was simply a monster, so he had excluded him, since Li Xuantong didn’t wish to have his self-confidence shattered every single time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

The achievements that Mu Chen obtained in these two to three years were extremely rare, even in the history of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That kid is truly formidable. How good would it be if he stayed in our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy forever?” Hallmaster Mo Yu couldn’t help sighing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Being short-sighted will break the future of another.” Northern Sea Dragon bluntly scolded with a black face to Hallmaster Mo Yu’s sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being scolded, Hallmaster Mo Yu wore a dejected expression as he said in awkwardness, “I’m just casually saying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Tai Cang couldn’t refrain from smiling from that scene, his eyes were a little abstruse as he said, “Mu Chen’s potential is very high, and it’s impossible for our academy to fully develop his potential. Only the vast Great Thousand World can be a stage for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Therefore, even if his strength could rise while staying in our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, it is impossible for him to become a true supreme expert. Mo Yu, do you believe that the next time Mu Chen returns to our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, not to mention about us, even Brother Northern Sea could not be compared to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yu’s expression was shaken as he had never expected such a high praise from Dean Tai Cang to Mu Chen.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　</span></p>

Unexpectedly, he did not refute Dean Tai Cang’s words as he knew that Dean Tai Cang’s words weren’t impossible. That youth… did possess a terrifying potential. The crucial point was that he had a firm heart to walk the path of supreme experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unswerving determination, stubbornness and a firm heart.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He should have.”</span></p>

However, there weren’t any guys to feast on such a scene. Ling Xi held onto a jade pot as she poured a drink for herself. She casually cast her glance at the sizable light pillar and indifferently nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Ling Xi, why are you not worried for Big Brother Mu Chen?” Sun’er was a little unhappy when she saw how indifferent Ling Xi was as she pouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He has a stunning beauty to protect him by his side right now, so there’s nothing for me to worry about.” Ling Xi said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ohhh~” Sun’er sat before Ling Xi with her eyes narrowed from her smile as she dragged her tone and chuckled, “So Big Sister Ling Xi is jealous of that beautiful big sister!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She’s very beautiful?” Ling Xi stared at Sun’er as a dangerous arc rose on her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As beautiful as Big Sister Ling Xi… No, I mean Big Sister Ling Xi is more beautiful!” Sun’er accidentally blurts out, but when she saw Ling Xi slightly raising her brows, she immediately changed her words upon sensing a bad premonition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.” Ling Xi lightly snorted as she raised her cold face and stared at the light pillar made of Spiritual Energy that stood towering between the heavens and earth, and gritted her teeth. Back then, when he was going into seclusion, she even took the initiative to ask if he needed her help to protect him. However, she was actually refused by that fellow, that’s simply detestable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sun’er sneaked a glance at Ling Xi and was confused in her head as well. Although Big Sister Ling Xi was cold when she treated others, she had a good heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, she got along with Big Sister Luo Li pretty well, so why is she so opposed of Big Sister Nine Nether?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was said that in the Goddess Luo Association, Big Sister Ling Xi and Big Sister Nine Nether were the most popular mature ladies… Although she didn’t quite understand what that was about…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Sun’er’s brain was running wild with thoughts, Ling Xi stood up as she looked at the sizable light pillar. In her eyes, there was a smear of gratification and pride.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He is indeed, Aunt Jing’s son, perhaps in the future, he will become as outstanding as Aunt Jing.</span></p>

When the light pillar faded, two light rays streaked across the horizon and appeared in the air of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy in a flash.</span></p>

His appearance was still the same, even that robust Spiritual Energy fluctuation around him had entirely dissipated. If it wasn’t for his bearing when he stood in the air, everyone might think that he failed his breakthrough.</span></p>

Compared to Mu Chen, she attracted even more attention. Her slender figure was a little tall, her fair neck was as graceful as a swan, and her exquisite collar bone drew a gentle arc. Especially that pair of long legs of hers that pulled the souls of others. Her slender eyes were filled with wildness that was flowing through, which made others understand that conquering such a woman was even harder than ascending to the sky.</span></p>

He breathed out with satisfaction and slowly clenched his fist. He could sense the volcanic surges of terrifying Spiritual Energy in his body. The strength of that Spiritual Energy wasn’t something that could be compared with Third Grade Spirit Disaster.</span></p>

I wonder if that is possible.” Mu Chen was a little nervous as he looked at Dean Tai Cang and cautiously spoke. This matter was too vital for him, and if it wasn’t possible, it would indeed be hard for him to search for the Immortal Catalog.</span></p>
