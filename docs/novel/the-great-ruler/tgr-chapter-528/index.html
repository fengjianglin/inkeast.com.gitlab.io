When that light image appeared, everyone could sense extremely shocking Spiritual Energy ripples being unleashed. The Spiritual Energy pressure froze even the space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of Mu Chen, Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan turned grave. The sudden change of events had far surpassed their expectations. Who could have thought that the Academy Alliance would hide such a trump card…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The strength of this Courtyard Spirit...is something that even First Grade Spirit Disaster probably could not fend against.” Luo Li said with a solemn expression as she tightly gripped her Luo God Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head in agreement with his brows furrowed. The current situation had became exceedingly troublesome. The fluctuation that was released from the Courtyard Spirit was definitely something that ordinary Spirit Disaster experts could not contend against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Mu Chen, how is it? No matter how powerful you guys are, didn’t you guys lose this game of chess?” Mo Yu stood within the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard as he looked at Mu Chen’s group of three, whose expressions were grave, and he could not help smiling as the proudness could not be concealed in his laughter. With this trump card, no matter how powerful Mu Chen and his group of three were, they could not change this outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You say that the Courtyard Spirit would indiscriminately clear out anyone that is not within the protection of the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard…” Mu Chen looked at Mo Yu as he continued, “Are you guys planning on hiding inside here even after obtaining the treasure in the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yu’s expression turned serious. He never thought that Mu Chen would discover this difficult problem that they would soon face. Just as Mu Chen had said, although they were the ones that summoned the Courtyard Spirit, it was impossible for them to control it. They would be out of the Courtyard Spirit’s attacking range when they were inside the protection radius. However, the instant they stepped out of that radius, they would face the hostility of the Courtyard Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to worry about that.”</span></p>

Although this was indeed a problem, the important issue was to deal with Mu Chen’s group of three at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the two of them were conversing, the eyes of the Courtyard Spirit that was hovering in the sky of the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard shone with brilliance. It swept its eyes out and fixed onto Mu Chen’s group of three. Thereafter, a hoarse voice resounded from its mouth, “Kill those who intrude without permission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Careful!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

With a flash, its figure had appeared before Wen Qinxuan like a ghost. Its palm that was emitting dazzling brilliance carried a hurricane-like Spiritual Energy as it slapped down on Wen Qingxuan without any hint of mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan was well-aware of how powerful the Courtyard Spirit was as her face turned grave. The golden warspear burst forth with golden brilliance once again and under the clear cry of a phoenix, it turned into a sharp golden light as it shot towards the palm of the Courtyard Spirit at light speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure appeared behind Wen Qingxuan at this moment as he pushed his palm against her shoulders. The earth-shattering impact was instantly transferred to him, causing wounds to tear open on his arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no expression on the Courtyard Spirit’s face as it waved its hands, unleashing a powerful ray of light as it surrounded Mu Chen and Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhhuuuu!</span></p>

The Spiritual Energy Sword Aura wrecked havoc as it tore the earth apart.</span></p>

Sharp Sword Intent was being emitted from the Luo God Sword as it fixed onto the Courtyard Spirit as a great opponent.</span></p>

Furthermore, even if they managed to clench victory with all sorts of trump cards used, they would still have to pay a huge price. However, that was probably what Mo Yu and his group would want to see the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do now?” Luo Li said with a low voice as she looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan had also directed her gaze towards Mu Chen. The strength of this Courtyard Spirit that stood before them had strength that surpassed their expectations. If they were to continue on fighting, it would definitely not be good news for them. After all, due to the Sealing Spiritual Array, her and Luo Li’s strength were sealed and could not use them to the fullest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyes flickered as he said with no hesitation. The situation had already gone out of their control. No matter how many methods they had, they would have to pay a huge price in order to deal with the Courtyard Spirit that possessed the strength of a Third Grade Spirit Disaster. Therefore, no matter how unwilling they were, they could only choose to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Luo Li nodded her head without any hesitation. Wen Qingxuan, however, was looking towards the protective radius of the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard, at Qin Feng’s group, whose faces were filled with complacency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Its figure flashed as it appeared in the sky. Spiritual Energy gathered in its hand as it had turned into a huge Spiritual Energy light seal. That light seal was verdant with a lush green color and complicated runes on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Green Wooden Mountain Sealing Stamp!”</span></p>

The light seal grew as it faced the wind, growing to a size of a few hundred feet that had nearly surrounded this land.</span></p>

The Courtyard Spirit seemed to have sensed their intention to retreat as it had unleashed its finishing move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The degree of the attack had reached to an extent that even First Grade Spirt Disasters could only dodge.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not your turn to cover the rear with your strength!” Wen Qingxuan said coldly. She had a strong personality that did not like to stand behind a man. Ever since she came here, she had already been saved by Mu Chen multiple times. Her personality would noy allow it if she were to let Mu Chen cover their backs while they retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen took a glance at her as he did not speak any rubbish. He extended his hand out to grab onto Wen Qingxuan’s tender shoulders as his Spiritual Energy surged out, pushing her towards the direction of the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Wen Qingxuan’s face flushed red in the air. Although she was furious, she did not fly back and could only stare with hatred at Mu Chen.</span></p>

She warned Mu Chen as she rapidly retreated as well.</span></p>

Even with his powerful physical body, he could feel stinging pain from the boundless energy. It was the sign that his physical body had felt danger.</span></p>

A brilliant light burst forth from his forehead and at the same time, a baleful aura surged out. A demonic pillar flew towards the heavens from the spiritual light. It was the Great Meru Demonic Pillar.</span></p>

Thereafter, he threw a punch out that heavily clashed against the bottom of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar.</span></p>

When they saw that Mu Chen had managed to withstand that startling attack from the Courtyard Spirit, their faces turned ugly as a smear of fear flashed in the depths of their gazes, since they knew that if they were in Mu Chen’s shoes, it was absolutely impossible for them to withstand that attack.</span></p>

When it retreated at high speed, his expression turned exceptionally grave. The strength of a Third Grade Spirit Disaster was indeed out of his expectations. Compared to the puppet on the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, it was simply not on the same level.</span></p>
