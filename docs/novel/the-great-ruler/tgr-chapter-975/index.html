 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen defeated both Jiang Ya and Qin Xuan, the last quota had completely fallen into his hands. In the coming days, he did not leave but stayed in the Nine Nether Realm, awaiting the opening of the Divine Beast Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the days that he stayed in the Nine Nether Realm, Mu Chen had gotten a place to stay, lead by Nine Nether, and shut himself in without coming out, concentrating on his cultivation to adjust his own state. After all, he was clear that although he had already displayed his strength in his fight with both Jiang Ya and Qin Xuan, it was still impossible for them to accept an outsider like Mu Chen so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, Mu Chen couldn’t be bothered to bootlick, so he stayed there and focused on his cultivation, aiming to be able to help Nine Nether obtain the Undying Bird’s Divine Blood in the Divine Beast Origin. After all, he did not come to the Nine Netherbird Clan to form friendships, but just purely help Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So during the days that he stayed in the Nine Nether Realm, he did not come in contact with the clansmen of the Nine Netherbird Clan. Nine Nether was the only one that he usually came in contact with whenever she told him pieces of information about the Divine Beast Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed extremely quickly and without him knowing, ten days had already passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the first shine of sunlight of the tenth day shone onto the majestic Nine Nether Mountain, Mu Chen had suddenly opened his eyes in the room and his black pupils flashed with sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked out the window and slightly his expression changed, before his silhouette flashed out to the courtyard. Not far away, there was a beautiful silhouette swiftly making her way over before stopping in the courtyard, it was naturally Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, the Divine Beast Origin will soon appear.” Nine Nether landed on the ground and looked at Mu Chen with a bewitching smile on her face that was extremely beautiful. After dealing with the trouble from their Bloodlink Bond, Nine Nether had clearly looked more at ease. She was no longer like the past, filled with worries in her heart every moment..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled and nodded his head. He did not speak, but flew up the sky before swiftly making his way towards the Nine Nether Mountain under Nine Nether’s lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, there were innumerable steaks as well. Those were the clansmen of the Nine Netherbird Clan rushing towards the peak of the mountain. Although the quota for the Divine Beast Origin was extremely few in number, these clansmen still had the yearning to see the Divine Beast Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them swiftly travelled and some ten-odd minutes later, they entered into the region of the mountain peak before descending onto the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peak was covered with a multitude of people at this moment, with Patriarch Tian Huang and the Elders standing at the centre of the plaza, and Mandala standing beside him. Compared to Mu Chen, the Nine Netherbird Clan was extremely courteous when treating Mandala. Regardless of anything, she was a genuine Greater Earth Sovereign Realm and with her strength, not to mention the Nine Netherbird Clan, she could easily become a VIP even in the powerful forces of the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Patriarch Tian Huang, Mo Feng and Mo Ling had already arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under countless gazes, Mu Chen and Nine Nether landed beside Mo Feng, whom he was indifferent to, having an expression as if nothing mattered to him. Mo Ling, however, gave Mu Chen a youthful and lively smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Patriarch Tian Huang saw the four of them gathered, he gently nodded his head, before raising it and cast a glance at the sky, then faintly said, “The Divine Beast Origin will soon appear. I will tear open the space along with the Elders and the four of you will take that chance to enter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the four of them heard his words, they all nodded their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Patriarch Tian Huang cast a glance at Mu Chen before saying, “The Divine Beast Origin is in the spatial void with a chaotic space rift wreaking havoc. If you guys are swept in it, you guys will definitely die. You have never entered the Divine Beast Origin, so you have a low understanding of it. After you enter, keep close to Nine Nether at all times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Mu Chen nodded his head. He had considered having gotten through quite a bit of dangerous situations over these past few years, thus he understood the dangers contained in the Divine Beast Origin. So, he would naturally not be foolish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Patriarch Tian Huang did not speak but raised his head and looked at the sky, waiting for the best opportunity to take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala walked towards Mu Chen and smiled. “After you go into the Divine Beast Origin, I will go back to the Great Havenlaw Domain. When you successfully come out, the Nine Netherbird Clan will send you back to the Northern Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After speaking about it, she paused before continuing, “After you leave, I will use the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid to sense the location of the Ancient Haven Palace to obtain as much accurate information for you as possible for when you return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew that the reason why Mu Chen came to the Northern Realm was for the evolution method of his Great Solar Undying Body hidden in the Ancient Haven Palace. Since she had received so much help from Mu Chen, it was natural for her to help him as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she had expected, when hearing her words, even Mu Chen couldn’t help feeling excited, even with his character. The Primordial Immortal Body was too important for him, so no matter what, he had to obtain the evolution method in the Ancient Haven Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have received favours from you, so it’s natural for me to reciprocate.” Mandala smiled before her expression turned serious. “But I have to remind you that the moment the Ancient Haven Palace appears, the Skylaw Continent will be greatly shaken. At that time, even I am not sure about how many forces will be attracted and the competition will be one that far surpasses your imagination.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, you’re not the only one targeting the evolution method for the Great Solar Undying Body…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard her words, he contracted his eyes as he looked at Mandala’s serious expression and recalled the information that she had told him in the past… In this world, he’s not the only one that cultivated the Great Solar Undying Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were other lucky people that obtained the cultivation method for the Great Solar Undying Body as well, and they were naturally absolutely stunning people. At the same time, they would become Mu Chen’s greatest obstacles in obtaining the Primordial Immortal Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of how many people were there that cultivated the Great Solar Undying Body, there would only be one that obtained the Primordial Immortal Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brutality of the competition would definitely exceed Mu Chen’s imagination. It was the survival of the fittest, where the weak became nutrients for the strong… Obtaining the Great Solar Undying Body was a massive opportunity for Mu Chen and, at the same time, a great danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With your current strength, you can ascend the peak amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region, but it’s far from enough.” Mandala seriously said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head, the Northern Region is only a portion of the Skylaw Continent. Not to mention about the other continents, even amongst the younger generations of the Nine Netherbird Clan alone, his Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm cultivation wasn’t particularly outstanding. So he naturally understood that it was still insufficient for him to compete for the opportunity in the Ancient Haven Palace with his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen solemnly looked at Mandala and slowly nodded his head. If he managed to break through to the Seventh Grade Sovereign Realm in the Divine Beast Origin and reached the second level of the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, then he wouldn’t have to fear, even if he faced an Eighth Grade Sovereign, and only those with that cultivation could be considered as experts in the Skylaw Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that Mandala was reminding him not to let his guard down. Although he had not met his opponents that had cultivated the Great Solar Undying Body as well, he could imagined that they were definitely absolute geniuses. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to cultivate the Great Solar Undying Body to such an extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala saw his response, she no longer spoke, but turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at Mandala’s silhouette and his gaze turned more grave. He initially thought that as long as he could find the Ancient Haven Palace, he should be able to obtain the evolution method of the Great Solar Undying Body. But Mandala had given him a wake-up call. If he wasn’t powerful enough, then even if he found the evolution method, it would only benefit others instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like I must definitely have a harvest in the Divine Beast Origin this time.” Mu Chen slowly clenched his fist and his gaze turned sharp. Although he spoke in this way, the competition that he would face would be even more brutal and he could only do his best to obtain the evolution method of the Great Solar Undying Body.</span></p>
