 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Streaks of light flew across the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen turned into a ray of light as he blew through the horizon. The injuries on his back had already recovered at this moment, his recovery speed even made him felt astonished. Clearly, the fearsome recovery was because of the Undying Flame merged in his spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were in the past, Mu Chen would definitely have to rest to recover before continuing the journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Undying Flame was indeed profound.” Mu Chen couldn’t help sighing. Shortly after, he turned his head over to the distant and sighed. Clearly, he had yet to recover from Lin Jing’s identity as the little princess of the Martial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? You can’t reluctant now?” Nine Nether appeared behind Mu Chen as she was staring at him with a strange gaze, “The Martial Realm is so much more powerful compared to the Great Havenlaw Domain. You would actually refuse?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen let out a faint smile as he spoke in a light tone, “Perhaps I will be protected upon joining the Martial Realm, and no one would provoke me, but so what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The supreme expert that I was referring to wasn’t this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the youth narrowed his eyes with a slight smile, “Furthermore… why can’t I accomplish something that this Martial Ancestor has accomplished?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your ambition isn’t small.” Nine Nether spoke as she raised her brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, although I might be overestimating myself a little, if I do not even have that courage, what am I going to talk about supreme expert?” Mu Chen laughed as self-confidence brilliance in his black pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether smiled hearing his words as she shifted her gaze towards the distant, “There should be the Teleportation Spiritual Array to the Skylaw Continent in the next city. At that time, we will be able to end our two months journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen silently felt relieved, two months of the rush journey wasn’t easy. But at the very least, it had finally come to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen clenched his teeth as he retrieves the Meru Bracelet that he had seized from Liu Ming. He injected spiritual energies in, and the light flickered, followed by two rays of light appearing in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the two rays of light, one was blazing as a sun, the other was withered dry as it quietly floated, emitting strange spiritual energy fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze was heated as he looked at them, he couldn’t help lifting a smile from the corner of his lips. He was a little excited in his heart as he had finally collected the three materials required to refine the Great Solar Undying Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sighed in his heart. If he were to remain in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, he might never be able to fully collect the materials required.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When do you intend to refine your Sovereign Celestial Body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether stared at the two lump of light as she enquired. If Mu Chen genuinely intended to compete for the Commander of the Great Havenlaw Domain, then he would definitely have to experience an intense competition. Furthermore, his competitors would all be excellent figures of the Skylaw Continent. They wouldn’t be weaker compared to Liu Ming, who relied on resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, even if Mu Chen succeeded in seizing the title, he would at least have to refine his Sovereign Celestial Body. Otherwise, it would be too much of a loss for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Refining the Sovereign Celestial Body isn’t something that can be accomplished in a day or two. I’ll start refining it when we arrive in the Great Havenlaw Domain.” Mu Chen spoke out after pondering. The Great Solar Undying Body wasn’t that ordinary stuff, no one knows what would happen in the midst of refining it. There are only the two of them here, if troubles were to come unfortunately and caused his refinery to fail, it would be a significant loss for him. After all, the three materials that he had gathered would be destroyed if he failed in refining it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then let us speed up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether looked at the distance as reminisce surged in her slender eyes. It had been so many years since she left the Great Havenlaw Domain, she didn’t have any idea what had the Nine Nether Palace become right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boundless spiritual energies surged from the two of them as they turned into streaks of light, swiftly shuttling across the horizon. In a blink of an eye, they had already disappeared in the background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skylaw Continent, Sky Profound Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Profound Palace sat at the extreme north of the Skylaw Continent as one of the major power in the continent. The Sky Profound Palace also possessed high status as they controlled vast territories. If it was simply based on scale, it was even bigger compared to ten Northern Heavens Continent added together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the vast territory, the Sky Profound Palace was the only controller of them. Although there were forces beneath them, they had all existed by attaching themselves to the Sky Profound Palace. Every year, they would have to submit a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid as offerings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, in the central region of the Sky Profound Palace, was an indescribable golden palace. Clouds surrounded it as it emitted golden light, it was like a celestial realm that was prestigious and faintly discernible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The depth of the golden palace was filled with spiritual energy. There was as if a light lotus that sat at the central area of the palace, with a silhouette quietly sat on the lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That silhouette was like a boulder. There was a rhythm to his breathing, every single one would be accompanied with gale and thunder roaring, causing the vast spiritual energies to whistle like an ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, the silhouette that was submerged in cultivation state opened his eyes. Rays of light that seemed as if it could pierce through space along with anger surfacing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He extended out his hand as a simple and unadorned jade pendant appeared. Right at this moment, the lustre of the jade pendant was gradually dimming down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ming’er’s soul imprint if getting weak… outrageous, someone actually dared to harm the son of mine, Liu Tiandao!” sharpness surged in the eyes of the silhouette as his deep voice blew up gale in the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He flicked his finger, causing the jade pendant to fly out. He made seals with his hand as spiritual energy enveloped the jade pendant as he attempted to probe to the location of Liu Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he probed for a long time but there was no reaction from the jade pendant, there wasn’t any news coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unable to probe? How is that possible?!” that figure exclaimed out as he abruptly stood up. spiritual energy retracted around him, revealing a middle-aged man donned in azure robes. His eyes were as abstruse as the starry sky, emitting great pressure in his every action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was the Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace, also the well-famed peak expert in the Skylaw Continent, Liu Tiandao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, his face was gloomy as his gaze flickered with light. At this instance, Liu Ming was naturally being trapped. Furthermore, the strength of the one that acted would undoubtedly be extremely terrifying as well. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be possible to shut off his probings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will take a look, who was it that dared to harm my son!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao coldly snorted as he waved his sleeve shortly. A massive eight trigrams light plate appeared. Soon after, he flicked his finger, causing the soul imprint to shatter as a ray of light shot into the eight trigrams plate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz! Buzz!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eight trigrams plate begun to spin as extremely profound light runes surged out, wrapping that golden light as space above the eight trigrams distorted as if it was trying to investigate something through space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space distorted as it tore a small spatial crack. Upon seeing this, Liu Tiandao strode a step in, and his figure disappeared in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merchant Continent, the land that Liu Ming was suppressed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space distorted as a figure stepped out of it a brief moment later, appearing in the sky. His sharp gaze swept in this region as he focused on land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light gathered in his eyes as if he was looking through the ground and saw a spiritual energy mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heaven and Earth Phase? It was actually an Earth Sovereign Realm?” Liu Tiandao’s face slightly changed as rage splurged forth in his eyes. He coldly snorted and waved his sleeve, causing the ground below to crack in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the earth split apart, a massive spiritual energy mountain appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s figure moved, landing on the peak of the mountain as he formed seals shortly after. A ray of light shot out, enveloping the massive mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was trying to dissolve this massive mountain made of spiritual energy, returning it to its initial state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as time passes, Liu Tiandao’s face gradually turned ugly as he realised that his actions weren’t sufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the spiritual energy mountain, there seemed to be a force resisting, containing the intent of the mysterious expert that acted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What ruthless means.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s face was cold, the person that acted seemed to have fixed on the idea of suppressing Liu Ming here.
