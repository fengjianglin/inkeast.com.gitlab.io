 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majestic Sovereign Celestial Body sat on the sky as the majestic Spiritual Energy that looked like an ocean whistled with violent fluctuations undulating out. That scene was extremely spectacular.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sleeping Emperor sat on the Sovereign Celestial Body that had a golden dragon coiled around it. The golden dragon opened its mouth and a dragon roar resonated with the might of a dragon spreading out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Dragon Celestial Boy that was ranked 70th amongst the 99 Rankings of the Sovereign Celestial Bodies!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless experts exclaimed in astonishment as they looked at the colossal figure that was covering the region. The Sovereign Celestial Body that the Sleeping Emperor had activated with his cultivation of Eighth Grade Sovereign was extremely condensed comparable to an actual body. That condensing degree was something that not even Mu Chen’s Great Solar Undying Body could be compared to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sighed as he looked at the massive Sky Dragon Celestial Body. This was the strongest Sovereign Celestial Body that he had seen to date. Naturally, that was because of the Sleeping Emperor’s terrifying strength. After all, even an ordinary Sovereign Celestial Body could also possess terrifying destructive capabilities in the hands of such an expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumour has it that the Sky Dragon Celestial Body requires a Sky Dragon to act as a medium for it to be successfully refined.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Mu Chen a little shocked was the fact that the Sky Dragon Celestial Body required the body of a Sky Dragon as a medium for it to be refined. Furthermore, absorbing its Spiritual Energy and fusing it with his own. However, the Sky Dragon was a high-ranked dragon amongst the dragon clan, with unfathomable strength. Furthermore, they had powerful backgrounds as well, so obtaining it was as hard as ascending the heavens. Since the Sleeping Emperor could achieve such a feat, it must’ve meant that he had an enormous opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the exclamations that filled the skies, the Devil Compassion Sovereign slowly raised his head. His usual calm demeanor had been replaced with graveness as he looked at the massive figure that the end could not be seen of. Shortly after, he formed seals with a single hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he formed his seals, there were torrential waves of Spiritual Energy that swept over as well. The dazzling golden light converged behind the Devil Compassion Sovereign. In just a few breaths’ time, the golden light condensed and a golden Sovereign Celestial Body that wasn’t any inferior to the Sky Dragon Celestial Body stood behind the Devil Compassion Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a Sovereign Celestial Body that looked to be forged from gold with an alms bowl in its massive hand. It was filled with countless ancient runes and a golden liquid appeared, looking like it was going to overflow from the alms bowl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the Great Vajra Celestial Body! Ranked the 73th of the 99 Rankings of Sovereign Celestial Bodies!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were countless gazes filled with shock upon looking at the golden Sovereign Celestial Body. The latter also had a body that looked like it was forged with gold, with unimaginable sturdiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the Sovereign Celestial Body of the Devil Compassion Sovereign was also not a simple one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two massive Sovereign Celestial Bodies stood between the heavens and earth, even the sky had turned dull from the pressure. Everyone held their breaths at this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure of the Sleeping Emperor slowly rose and landed at the head of the Sky Dragon Celestial Body. He was looking at the Great Vajra Celestial Body, but did not speak a single word since he knew that there would definitely be a victor out of the two of them today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reaching their level of strength, they definitely had to use their hidden cards in order to determine the victor out of the two of them. It was a situation that no one knew what would happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Sleeping Emperor wasn’t an indecisive person, his gaze flickered and he abruptly stomped his feet. The golden dragon on the Sovereign Celestial Body beneath him opened its ferocious mouth and firmly sucked in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space crumbled before him and countless space fragments were sucked into the mouth of the Sky Dragon. In the next instant, a golden Spiritual Energy, along with the black space fragments, spurt out like a torrent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Void Shattering Dragon Breath!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden current directly penetrated through space, disregarding distance, and appeared before the Great Vajra Celestial Body. Such a torrent that gathered the power of space was sufficient to destroy anything that obstructed its path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Vajra Palm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Compassion Sovereign had a grave expression as his mind moved. The Great Vajra Celestial Body threw a palm out and the palm expanded against the wind. As a golden light glittered, it formed into a golden mountain and clashed with the torrent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire region violently trembled in that instant of contact. A hurricane the size of a few thousand feet was formed from the clash, it was like a demonic dragon as it wreaked havoc on the land, causing the sky to crumble and the earth to crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden torrent clashed against the huge palm that seemed like a golden mountain, causing space to shatter in layers. The golden palm was sent back a few hundred feet. But as it crumbled, the torrent that contained the fragments of space was also blocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hurricane between the heavens and earth continued to wreak havoc, causing countless spectators’ hearts to leap. A confrontation of this level was truly fearsome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the Devil Compassion Sovereign flickered as he watched the golden torrent pressing over. His gaze turned even more solemn. On the contrary, when his gaze was turning grave, his body was gradually easing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truly worthy of becoming the head of the Three Emperors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Compassion Sovereign’s calm voice rang out along with the hurricane that was spreading out in this region. He stared at Sleeping Emperor, who was standing on the head of the Sky Dragon Celestial Body, and deeply inhaled a mouthful of air. Reaching their level of strength, it’s not possible to determine the winner through ordinary means. Since that was the case, then there was no need to hold his hands back any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can receive this attack of mine, then consider this fight your victory!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Compassion Sovereign slowly closed his eyes and formed seals with both of his hands. Along with his hands coming together, the huge palm of his Sovereign Celestial Body that looked to be forged from gold was aimed at the Sleeping Emperor and the Sky Dragon Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the alms bowl revolved, the hurricane in this region froze. It was so much so that in that instant, even the flow of the air had slowed down as an unspeakable danger revolved between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every expert felt the tingling chill on their skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the Devil Compassion Sovereign had decided not to drag the battle any further and was able to resort to his final move to swiftly determine the victor of this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s face was also tensed as he watched this scene. He could sense that there was a terrifying fluctuation flowing in the alms bowl, this must be the strongest attack that the Devil Compassion Sovereign could deploy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is he trying to do?” Tang Bing couldn’t help asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze flickered as he softly said, “I’m afraid that he will deploy his Sovereign Ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sovereign Ability, something that was only possessed by a powerful Sovereign Celestial Body. But judging from the looks right now, the Great Vajra Celestial Body possessed such capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How terrifying would the might of an Eighth Grade Sovereign deploying his Sovereign Ability be? It was something that Mu Chen could not imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes in this region, a white mist slowly spat out of the mouth of the Devil Compassion Sovereign. Shortly after, he abruptly opened his eyes. His eyes that were usually calm looked like they could crumble mountains and shatter the earth as they became filled with violence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seals formed from his both hands hung as he barked out with his eyes opening wide, “Sovereign Ability - The Destroying Vajra Alms Bowl!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The massive golden alms bowl trembled as ancient runes flew out of it. The alms bowl violently trembled, and in the next instant, a golden torrent swept out from the bowl. The torrent was endless, causing space to shatter from the suppressive force the moment it appeared. In the end, it formed into countless golden torrents as it shot towards the Sleeping Emperor from every direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden torrents were filled with ancient runes. The power of every single torrent could make a Seventh Grade Sovereign feel a numbingness on their scalp. But with such an amount gathered here, not even an Eighth Grade Sovereign would dare to face it head-on!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an attack without any holding back from the Devil Compression Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden torrent that filled the skies swept across countless gazes of shock. However, the figure of the Sleeping Emperor still stood on the Sky Dragon Celestial Body without any indications to budge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this region, only the Great Havenlaw Ruler had no change to his expression, while Liu Tiandao, who stood on another area in the sky, had his brows slightly frowning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden torrents drew back and shot forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile remained on the face of the Sleeping Emperor as he abruptly formed seals with gold flowing in the depths of his pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden Sky Dragon that was coiling around the Sky Dragon Celestial Body let out a long roar as it opened its mouth and deeply inhaled. Thereafter, everyone in this region was dumbfounded as they witnessed the golden torrents that contained terrifying energy being directly sucked into the mouth of the golden Sky Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire region was in silence. No one expected that the strongest attack of the Devil Compassion Sovereign would be so easily received by the Sleeping Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So powerful…” Tang Bing covered her mouth as she exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s face also changed as his gaze fixed on the figure of the Sleeping Emperor. That earlier instant, he sensed what seemed to be tiny changes to the Spiritual Energy fluctuations that were enveloping the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shocked exclamation constantly resounded. The Sword Concealing Elder and the rest of the Hundred Battles Domain faction couldn’t help changing their faces. The outcome of this was probably beyond their expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is that possible?! They are both Eighth Grade Sovereigns, so how could he block the all-out attack of Devil Compassion?!” The Sword Concealing Elder solemnly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Great Vajra Celestial Body, the Devil Compassion Sovereign looked at the the distant figure. Along with the dissipation of golden light, the figure of the Sleeping Emperor appeared once again. But this time, the terrifying Spiritual Energy that was surging around him had completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Spiritual Energy had disappeared, the Devil Compassion Sovereign sensed a real threat of danger enveloping him that caused shock to appear on his calm face. He took a deep glance at the Sleeping Emperor. “So, I have misjudged…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be able to make an Eighth Grade Sovereign like him feel pressure, the Sleeping Emperor’s strength had clearly exceeded his!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the Sleeping Emperor wasn’t at Eighth Grade Sovereign but Ninth Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people in this region were speechless. Even the Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor involuntarily inhaled a deep breath. Who would have thought that the Sleeping Emperor, who was always sleeping, would be so deep and unfathomable…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I lost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Compassion Sovereign was straightforward. He knew that there was no chance of winning for him. He directly dissipated his Sovereign Celestial Body and returned to the Hundred Battles Domain camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first battle ended with the victory of the Great Havenlaw Domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We won!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A stunning burst of cheers rang out from the Great Havenlaw Domain and Tang Bing couldn’t help having a smile on her face. With the first victory, if they could win once more, the fight would end with the victory of their Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first battle had come to an end, while the second battle was soon starting.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, under the cheers of the Great Havenlaw Domain’s faction, as their hearts became relaxed for the upcoming fight, the second battle ended stunningly fast.

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had abruptly widened their eyes and filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just three moves, the Asura King lost with heavy injuries!</span></p>
