 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing and Tang Rou were stunned as they looked at the Spiritual Energy light screen on the stone stage of the Nine Nether Palace. When they saw the youth gradually heading into the distance, they recovered from their shock as the splendour of joy shone in their eyes. Tang Rou couldn’t help cheering; and even Tang Bing, who had a pretty good will, had pursued a tiny smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength that Mu Chen had displayed was indeed out of their expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four heads of Mt Mang had some fame even amongst the Great Havenlaw Domain, and their strength was also pretty decent. With them joining together, they might even be able to confront an expert of Second Grade Sovereign Realm. But, right now, they had landed in such a miserable state by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s performance gave everyone a surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even among the Nine Nether Troop, Qiu Shan and the rest had shock filling their eyes as the admiration they had for Mu Chen rose in their hearts. It didn’t matter where it was, strength was the hardest justification. If their Nine Nether Troop could have such a Commander, it might not be a bad thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The battle of ascension has just started, if he can’t obtain the final qualification, it’s useless, no matter how outstanding his performance is.” Nine Nether was the calmest as she smiled while looking at the sisters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it useless? After all, Mu Chen’s age is a little young. He had just come to the Great Havenlaw Domain, so it is reasonable if he fails. Even if he fails this time, he will definitely win the next.” Tang Rou defended as she felt injustice for Mu Chen. After all, he had already done an excellent job.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing, who was beside her, did not speak a single word. Compared to Tang Rou, she was naturally a little more mature, and even though she knew that Mu Chen had indeed done an excellent job, the reality was harsh. No matter how outstanding he was, only those that stood on the peak would be the focus of attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one would pay any attention to the clusters of failures that had become stepping stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Mu Chen could not obtain the qualification in the end, perhaps the shock he caused earlier will instantly disappear. At most, there would be people feeling pity for him and forget about it after that. Because at that time, he would just be a failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether looked at the two girls, whose breathing had instantly weakened, as her rosy lips lifted. She gazed at the massive Spiritual Energy light screen as she muttered, “But… Mu Chen will not lose so easily…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the region where the Nine Nether Palace was located was celebrating, the Blood Hawk Hall’s region was a little quiet, even the atmosphere was a bit strange. Many experts of the Blood Hawk Hall exchanged look as they sneaked peeks towards the throne. They did not dare to alarm the Blood Hawk King, who had no expression at the moment, since they could sense the torrential rage in the latter’s heart at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The armrest of Blood Hawk King’s throne cracked and his chest was heavily heaving as he suppressed the rage in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truly four pieces of trash…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He muttered as he stared at the screen. There was a sharp eerie light flowing in his eyes. Shortly after, he leaned back on the throne with an indifferent expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was indeed a little beyond his expectations for Mu Chen to defeat the four Sovereigns of Mt Mang. But it no longer mattered, as long as Mu Chen did not obtain the qualification, in the end, all of his efforts were for nought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The competition of the Greatlaw Goldpond had just begun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a golden current flowing down from the majestic Goldpond Peak, the surges made many people feel cold in their hearts. Fortunately, they had not targeted someone. Otherwise, without mentioning their strengths being only at the First and Second Grade, even the Nine Kings might have a hard time reaching the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, at this moment, two figures were stepping on the golden ocean of trees, their gazes were directed at the distance where the intense battle broke out between Mu Chen and the four heads of Mt Mang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That Mu Chen actually defeated the four Sovereigns of Mt Mang?” Wu Tian slightly knitted his brows as he looked into the distance. Previously, they had witnessed the fight, and those methods that Mu Chen had executed were indeed very powerful. It was no wonder why he could kill a First Grade Sovereign in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tian was frowning his brows, but he broke into a smile a moment later. “But this makes things interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was genuinely astonished by the fact that Mu Chen could defeat four First Grade Sovereigns, but that was all to it. With his current strength, there weren’t many difficulties for him to achieve the same results. In his eyes, the four Sovereigns of Mt Mang didn’t pose a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The difference between the grades of Sovereigns was not something that could be so easily complemented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like the heavens are giving me a chance.” Cao Feng faintly smiled with both of his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, it just so happens that we can show others the difference between the old and new Domain Lods of the Nine Nether Troop.” Wu Tian smiled, “We don’t have to bother about him for the time being, let’s ascend the peak first. This time, I want to try and see if I can push my ranking a little higher.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he turned his head towards the depths of the Goldpond Peak and licked his lips. From his appearance, he was like a wolf that was glaring at his prey and would not give up until he achieved his objective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cao Feng raised his brows. “You intend to fight Zhou Yue?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Wu Tian was ranked three amongst the Four Great Domain Lords. If he could defeat Zhou Yue, he could increase his ranking by one. However, Zhou Yue was the general under the Mountain Splitting King, the achievements he acquired for all these years were splendid and he could be considered as an influential figure in the Great Havenlaw Domain. He was a genuine formidable opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Cao Feng was using the resources of the Blood Hawk Hall and had a significant increase in his strength, he understood that he wouldn’t be able to shake the rankings of the Four Great Domain Lords for the time being. But if it was Wu Tian, he might have that ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The ranking of being in 3rd doesn’t feel too good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tian grinned with a smile, revealing his white teeth. After that, he did not speak anymore as he waved his sleeve and his figure flew out, flitting across like an eagle as he tore apart the golden current and made his way towards the peak at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that sight, Cao Feng immediately followed up. Along the way, they encountered some experts, but no one dared to provoke them. After all, they were two of the Four Great Domain Lords, they would undoubtedly seek death if they went after them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Wu Tian and Cao Feng had once again made their way up the mountain, there were another two figures that stood in the sky in a different location far away. Those two were the 1st and 2nd rank of the Four Great Domain Lords, Xu Qing and Zhou Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a smear of astonishment in their eyes as they watched Mu Chen’s earlier fight, but they did not say anything and inwardly revealed a trace of interest.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like there will be some variables in this competition of the Greatlaw Goldpond…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>

The speed had even surpassed several experts up in the front. When those experts were surpassed, their faces changed. They hesitated for a brief moment, but, in the end, they chose not to attack. Because they didn’t have the confidence to defeat an expert that could defeat the four Sovereigns of Mt Mang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dragon figure was undoubtedly Mu Chen. He had obtained a Dragon Soaring Art, an agility-based Divine Art, from the White Dragon Sovereign a ways back. In the beginning, this Divine Art had provided a decent amount of help for Mu Chen, but along with him getting stronger, the effect of the Dragon Soaring Art had also gradually decreased until he stepped into the Sovereign Realm…</span></p>

Achieving this step, he could change into a draconic figure as he utilised the mystical energy to tear through space to shorten the distance. Earlier, it was the might of this Dragon Soaring Art that allowed him to dodge the inescapable net from the four Sovereigns of Mt Mang.</span></p>

With the strength he had displayed, anyone that intended to attack him would have to consider it wisely.</span></p>

Within the draconic image, Mu Chen swept his gaze around as he started to approach the peak of the Goldpond Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From his perception, there were about twenty Spiritual Energy fluctuations in this region, and every single one of them was pretty powerful. They were even stronger than those Sovereign experts he had encountered before.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head, looking towards the distance. There was a brilliant golden platform with golden light circulating on it, looking as if it was forged with gold. He knew that it was the Greatlaw Goldstage, the only path towards the Greatlaw Goldpond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only through this path could he have the qualification to ascend the peak.</span></p>

However, when he travelled about a hundred feet, his figure abruptly came to a stop as the draconic image faded away and returned to a human form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood in the air as he swept his gaze around narrowed eyes. In this vast ocean of trees, there were multiple figures quietly standing still with some distance separating one other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single one of those figures had sharp gazes that were similar to hawks and falcons with tremendous Spiritual Energy fluctuating around them, attracting the whistling of violent gales.</span></p>

Thus, if they wished to go there, they would have to charge through with their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at those people as their clothes fluttered and a sharp gaze in their eyes. He couldn’t help gently licking his lips as his black pupils blazed with fighting intent.</span></p>
