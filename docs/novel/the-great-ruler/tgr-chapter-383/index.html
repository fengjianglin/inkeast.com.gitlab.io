 <p><strong>Chapter 383 - Battle of the Sovereigns</strong></p>
 <p>Boundless Spiritual Energy flooded the large hall. The Spiritual Energy present here was extremely pure, with faint signs of being liquid-like. With the level of Spiritual Energy within each clump being comparable to the maximum amount a Heavenly Completion Stage expert could condense within one’s body…</p>
 <p>Within the centre of all that boundless Spiritual Energy, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar continued to endlessly emit humming noises. However, the frightening demonic energies were unwaveringly suppressed by the Spiritual Energy, unable to spew out as previously.</p>
 <p>The Demonic Dragon pattern squirmed about on the surface of the demonic pillar, as if the Demonic Dragon Brand had seemingly sensed the impending danger. Low and deep roars rang out from it as a dark and sinister black brilliance radiated from it, defending against the corrosion brought by the boundless Spiritual Energies.</p>
 <p>Humm. Humm.</p>
 <p>However, faced against the collaboration of six Sovereign Stage existences, the Demonic Dragon Brand was by itself and appeared clearly weaker. Even though it had taken root within the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, and was unable to borrow some of its demonic energies, with signs of it starting to dissipate under the corrosion of the boundless Spiritual Energies.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mu Chen was standing at the furthest position possible, while he was unable to move a single inch of his body. That was due to the immense pressure created by six Sovereigns unleashing their Spiritual Energies.</p>
 <p>With nothing he could do about it, he could only bitterly laugh in helplessness. With his strength only at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase, he was not even at the level of an ant in front of a Sovereign Stage expert. Just the Spiritual Energy pressure created by them was enough to make him incapable of budging.</p>
 <p>However, the only thing that could make Mu Chen feel comfort was that the Demonic Dragon Brand was being dispelled. That was undeniably removing an extreme danger hidden within.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>However, just as Mu Chen had exhaled a breath of relief, extremely terrifying energies furiously gushed out from the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. The Demonic Dragon Brand, which was gradually being corroded by the boundless Spiritual Energies gushing from Dean Tai Cang and the five Elders, radiated with intense black rays of light at this moment. Dragon roars howled out as storms were whipped up by the Demonic Dragon Brand. Separating itself from the demonic pillar, it had unexpectedly transformed into a rather frightening demonic dragon.</p>
 <p>As the demonic dragon coiled up in the air, frightening fluctuations radiated from its jet-black body. Being somewhat unable to endure them, the surrounding space even started showing signs of shattering.</p>
 <p>“Tai Cang, are you planning to take the treasure of our Demonic Dragon Palace for your own? It isn’t that easy!” In a seated position, the gigantic eyes of the demonic dragon roared with incomparable rage and ferocity towards the people present in the large hall.</p>
 <p>“Black Dragon Sovereign?!”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that familiar voice, Mu Chen’s heart was instantly overwhelmed with shock and dread.</p>
 <p>“Look’s like you’re unable to endure it after all, huh, Black Dragon Sovereign?” Upon seeing this, Tai Cang gave a faint smile as if he didn’t feel the slightest bit of surprise. Obviously, he had long expected the outcome of this situation.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! The guts of your Demonic Dragon Palace ain’t small! You’re really asking for trouble by daring to send a remnant shadow to charge into our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy!” A cold snort rang out from Hall Master Mo You as his expression turned dark.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! In this Northern Heavens Continent, our Demonic Dragon Palace can go wherever we want! Do you think you can stop us?!” Another cold voice rang out from within the demonic dragon. This voice was different from the Black Dragon Sovereign. However, it appeared similarly cold and frightening.</p>
 <p>“Haha. If not for you guys activating the Demonic Dragon Brand, we wouldn’t have been able to cast our projections over. Today’s a good day. Relying on the power of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, we’ll completely butcher all of you!” A laughing voice brimming with cruel tyranny rang out from within the demonic dragon.</p>
 <p>“So, it's not just a single projection. Can it be that the Six Great Hall Masters of the Demonic Dragon Palace have arrived?” Elder Zhu Tian spoke out with a sneer.</p>
 <p>“Six Great Hall Masters?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was startled as he heard those words. Looking towards the gigantic eyes of demonic dragon, a black brilliance erupted from within as six blurry figures were faintly discernable from within. Those six figures were akin to figures of demon gods, causing people to feel extreme pressure and oppression.</p>
 <p>“All of you guys have finally gathered together. However, it’ll not change the result one single bit.” Chilling intent flashed within the abstruse eyes of Dean Tai Cang. With a wave of his sleeve, the boundless Spiritual Energy gushing out of him transformed into a sea of Spiritual Energy. As the waves surged out, they shattered space, sweeping straight towards the sitting demonic dragon.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Hall Master Mo You and the other four Heavenly Seated Elders launched their attacks, causing boundless Spiritual Energies to sweep out.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, the demonic dragon gave a roar. Extending its claws, it grabbed onto the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. Violently fanning it out, it smashed the incoming Spiritual Energy sea apart.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At this moment, frightening demonic energies erupted from the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. As the demonic pillar was waved around, the surrounding space was split and shattered apart, completely blocking against the boundless Spiritual Energies heading towards the demonic dragon.</p>
 <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>
 <p>As a frightening fight erupted within the large hall, the startled Mu chen hastily shot out of the large hall. In the next instant, cracks started to appear and split apart on the surface of the Spiritual Array-reinforced large hall.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As the cracks extended to their extremities, unable to endure the frightening shock waves forming within, the large hall exploded apart. As the frightening Spiritual Energy shock waves rushed out, storms were whipped up in the air above the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, attracting the shocked and horrified gazes of countless students.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As countless shocked and terrified gazes looked over, the large hall exploded apart. In the next instant, a gigantic dragon with a demonic pillar grasped within its hands rushed towards the sky. Six streams of light rushed towards the horizon from the surroundings as boundless Spiritual Energy seas enveloped over, continuously sweeping towards the demonic dragon. As the Spiritual Energy seas came pressuring over, space started to shatter, piece by piece, showing their extremely terrifying destructive powers.</p>
 <p>Such a terrifying exchange appearing out of nowhere caused all the students to stare in dumbfounded shock. Did they ever see a fight of such degree?</p>
 <p>Alarm cries quickly resounded across the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, causing numerous higher levels of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to swiftly shoot over. Looking gravely at the fight taking place in the sky, shock and astonishment appeared within their eyes.</p>
 <p>At a secluded peak far away, a big and small figure could be seen observing the battle up in the sky. It was Ling Xi and Sun’er.</p>
 <p>“Such frightening Spiritual Energy fluctuations… even the Dean and the other Elders have actually taken action.” Sun’er cried out in shock.</p>
 <p>“That’s…the people of the Demonic Dragon Palace.” Ling Xi’s crescent moon-shaped eyebrows slightly bunched up. Staring at the demonic dragon, she spoke out in response.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you going to take action, Elder Sister Ling Xi? That demonic dragon seems extremely formidable!” Sun’er replied in worry. This was, after all, the inner region of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. If students were to be swept up in the collateral energies radiating out from the fight, this would be too grave and serious for the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Gently shaking her small head, Ling Xi replied in a faint voice, “There’s only the projections of those fellows from the Demonic Dragon Palace within that demonic dragon. How can they contend against Dean Tai Cang and the other Elders? Therefore, there’s no need for me to take action.”</p>
 <p>Speaking until here, her gaze turned slightly towards the mountain peak located below of the fighting radius. There was a thin figure faintly discernable over there, which was precisely Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Mu Chen’s figure, faint fluctuations appeared for an instant within her eyes.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mu Chen didn’t notice the gaze coming from Ling Xi in the far distance as his head pointed towards the sky. Although the commotion coming from the sky was extremely huge, he wasn’t overly worried about that. The fight happening there was clearly in the control of Dean Tai Cang and the five Elders. After all, the Six Great Hall Masters of the Demonic Dragon Palace had only sent their projections over. Although they were relying on the might of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, they were still unable to truly contend with Dean Tai Cang and the five Elders.</p>
 <p>If this continued, it would be no surprise to anyone that Dean Tai Cang would obtain victory.</p>
 <p>“Is there any point in doing such useless actions, Black Dragon Sovereign?! Today, none of you will be able to bring it out of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy!” Dean Tai Cang spoke out with a cold and detached expression.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Is that right?!”</p>
 <p>Black Dragon Sovereign’s sneering voice rang out, while sinister and chilling intent seemed to surface within the eyes of the demonic dragon. In the next instant, its body suddenly started to crazily inflate. At this moment, the six blurry figures within the giant eyes of the demonic dragon had unexpected exploded.</p>
 <p>“Careful! They want to self-destruct their projections!” Dean Tai Cang’s eyes instantly contracted as he cried out.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At the instant when his cry rang out, the demonic dragon had already inflated to a size nearing ten thousand feet. Hiding the sky and covering the earth, it completely exploded in the next instant. Seemingly destructive fluctuations swept out, enveloping the academy below.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Dean Tai Cang and the five Elders instantly retreated. Sending a palm patting out, boundless Spiritual Energy seas expanded out underneath, enveloping the academy below them.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>As the destructive fluctuations smashed against the Spiritual Energy seas, deep and low sounds erupted out. However, they were unable to pierce through them in the end, causing the pale faces of the countless students below to regain some colour.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>After Dean Tai Cang and the five Elders had successfully blocked the destructive fluctuations, a bloody light rushed towards the sky. The Great Meru Demonic Pillar swiftly followed suit as the space before it violently distorted, transforming into a pathway.</p>
 <p>“Don’t let it escape!” Dean Tai Cang’s expression sank. Those Demonic Dragon fellows were really decisive and ruthless. They had actually wanted to let the Great Meru Demonic Pillar escape by itself.</p>
 <p>However, relying on the explosive force due to the explosion of the projections, the speed of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar drastically increased. In a flash, it had already rushed into the spatial pathway, and was just about to disappear within.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>However, just at the instant when it was about to shuttle through the spatial pathway, the entire stretch of the world suddenly turned dim. Overwhelmed with shock, countless people raised their heads, only to see a ten thousand foot long feathery wing unfurling across the horizon. This entire stretch of the world was shrouded by the shadow it created.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Under the feathery wing, sharp black claws were thrust out, causing the spatial pathway to completely shatter apart. Piercing deep within the spatial path, it grabbed onto the Great Meru Demonic Pillar within.</p>
 <p>As the feathery wing that hid the skies and covered the earth rapidly disappeared, sunlight came enveloping back. As the strange scene suddenly disappeared, countless students looked at each other, slightly confused over what had just happened.</p>
 <p>“Just now, that’s…”</p>
 <p>“It looked like a wing…”</p>
 <p>“Such a big wing! Could it…could this be the Divine Beast Protector of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Lord Northern Sea Dragon?”</p>
 <p>“…so formidable! Even space was captured!’</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>A Clamoring of emotional voices erupted across the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>On the mountain peak, Mu Chen’s face was filled with shock and astonishment. However, before he could regain his clarity from it, a black streak of light shot over the horizon, shooting straight into his body.</p>
 <p>It’s the Great Meru Demonic Pillar!</p>
 <p>With a thought, the Mandala flower within his aurasea immediately bloomed. Countless purple-coloured chains shot out, rapidly wrapping around the demonic pillar, before pulling it back into the centre of the flower. In the next instant, purplish light radiated, before suppressing and sealing it up once again!</p>
 <p>Hu.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the Great Meru Demonic Pillar was sealed once again, Mu Chen breathed a sigh of relief akin to having a heavy weight lifted off his shoulders. For the sake of dealing with the Demonic Dragon Brand, the peak existences of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had all taken action…</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang and the five Elders shot down, appearing beside Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>“Haha. We’re fortunate to have lord Northern Sea take action. If not, we’d have really lost it,” said Mo You with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Those fellows are really decisive. Exploding their own projections. That will definitely cause damage to their true bodies.” Elder Zhu Tian added with a frown.</p>
 <p>With a smile also present on his face, Dean Tai Cang looked towards Mu Chen and said, “However, it's good that we didn’t lose it. From today onwards, the Demonic Dragon Palace will no longer be able to control the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. As long as you’re able to control it, it will be yours.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you very much, Dean!” Mu Chen was unable to express how much gratitude he had from them. They had helped settle a gargantuan hidden danger for him. He would absolutely have been unable to achieve it by himself. After all, he didn’t have the strength to face against the projections of six Sovereign Stage experts.</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, Dean Tai Cang didn’t continue speaking anything as he turned around, planning to leave.</p>
 <p>“Dean…”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing him leave, Mu Chen hastily called out to him. When Dean Tai Cang had turned around and faced him, Mu Chen hesitated for a moment. Summoning his courage, he spoke out, “I’ve some interest towards the Divine Spiritual Mountain…”</p>
 <p>“Divine Spiritual Mountain?” Hall Master Mo You and the other four Elders were all startled, before starting to slightly frown. This matter was, in fact, a thorn in the heart of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. After all, they were a leviathan and the Overlords of the Northern Heavens Continent. However, they had always been unable to participate in the biggest occasion of the Northern Heavens Continent, causing quite a few tongues wagging outside for the past few years.</p>
 <p>“It’s too dangerous.” Shooting a look at Mu Chen, Dean Tai Cang shook his head, before turning around and walking away.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen gave a bitter laugh, shrugging his shoulders in disappointment. <em>Looks like I’ve no affinity with this Divine Spiritual Mountain.</em></p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang’s footsteps suddenly paused, before he entered the large hall. Placing his hands behind his back, he pondered deeply for a moment, before a faint voice rang out from him.</p>
 <p>“If you really want to go, there’s a possibility. Make a breakthrough to Heavenly Completion Stage in a month.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing those words, Mu Chen immediately felt elated, before becoming dejected the next moment. Make a breakthrough to Heavenly Completion Stage in one month…this level of difficulty was too high…</p>
