 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s somewhat cold voice rang out in the sky of this city, the commotion in this area spontaneously came to an end. Innumerable people were looking at the black-clothed, slender youth with shock in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere in the sky also seemed to be a little frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had imagined that the Commander that was brought back by Nine Nether would be so firm. The moment he showed himself, he had already said those words before he was even able to stand firm. Was he not afraid of the rebound and falling out?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a total of over fifty City Lords here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people exchanged a look. They were clearly startled by the unusual actions of this new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While everyone was startled by Mu Chen’s words, the City Lords that were on the plaza, including Luo Mang and his group, also had startled expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The formation that they had set up was with the intention of slightly suppressing those of the Nine Nether Palace. Luo Mang also believed that facing such a formation was sufficient to make a First Grade Sovereign brat feel pressure. As long as Mu Chen was shocked by their formation, they would have the initiative in the next negotiation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Mang had somewhat predicted the situation, so his preparations could be considered ample. But at this moment, he was at a loss at this instant and realised that the formation he had set up seemed to have been disregarded by the new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being at a loss, rage surged as Luo Mang’s face instantly grew dark. He stared at Mu Chen and sneered, “How mighty of the new Commander. Who are you to dismiss us from our City Lord positions?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of the other City Lords also had faint anger written on their faces. However, the majority had their gazes flickering instead because Mu Chen’s grandeur was too excessive. He didn’t seem to be roping them in. Judging from his tone, was there any intention to negotiate?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Mu Chen maintained a calm expression, but his black pupils were filled with a chill. He naturally saw through Luo Mang’s intentions. Furthermore, he clearly knew about the morality and conduct of this person right before him. Facing such a person, as long as you showed signs of moving back, he would want a mile instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You retreat a step, and he would advance a foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only solution was to cut the crap and step on his face, not giving him any leeway!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His words represent our Nine Nether Palace!” Standing behind Mu Chen, Tang Bing had a cold gaze as she looked at the City Lords and continued to coldly say, “If you guys are unconvinced, then sound your opposition to the three Emperors!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Mang’s face slightly changed as his gaze grew even darker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen coldly swept his gaze at the City Lords and lightly said, “If there are still any City Lords loyal to the Nine Nether Palace, we of the Nine Nether Palace will definitely keep them. But if you want to threaten us, I will let you understand the right of attribution to those cities. They belonged to our Nine Nether Palace, if you are unhappy, then my Nine Nether Palace will cripple you. I believe that many people will be interested in such a pleasant job as the City Lord.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many City Lords had the corners of their lips twitching. Was the Nine Nether Palace crazy to dismiss so many City Lords? The Nine Nether Palace wasn’t afraid of those cities going out of control?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if the Nine Nether Palace truly smashed the jug and dismissed all of them… it would be their loss. It would be an incredibly huge loss; after all, as Mu Chen had said, many people were eyeing the City Lord’s position. The Great Havenlaw Domain was vast with experts as many as the clouds in the sky. Getting someone to replace them wasn’t a tough thing to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some City Lords couldn’t help feeling nervous in their hearts, thinking that if they had gone too far to force the Nine Nether Palace to the position where neither side wins…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the Nine Nether Palace had a backing. So even if the loss was significant this time, the Nine Nether Palace could be maintained. But if they were to lose their position as the City Lord, they would lose all backings and resources. Losing the resources support of the Great Havenlaw Domain, their cultivation path would also become difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many City Lords had their facial expressions changing and were flustered by Mu Chen’s actions that weren’t a concern about the consequences. The angered expressions on their faces had also turned to hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Luo Mang saw this scene, his gaze turned cold. He had still underestimated the new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace. Although the brat was still young, his actions were decisive. This hand of smashing the jug suppressed the stirring thoughts of many City Lords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, what nonsense are you talking about? These cities are now under the jurisdiction of the Blood Hawk Hall. The City Lord’s positions are controlled by the Blood Hawk Hall. Since when is it your turn to have a say in it?!” Luo Mang’s voice sharply resounded. At this point in time, if he didn’t say anything, those City Lords might have the heart to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, don’t be frightened by him, Lord Blood Hawk King is watching us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the three words “Blood Hawk King”, the eyes of these City Lords flashed across with a smear of fear. Compared to Nine Nether, who had been missing for a long time, the intimidation coming from the Blood Hawk King was undoubtedly stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those City Lords whose hearts were wavering secretly exchanged a glance and bitterly smiled in their hearts. In fact, it didn’t matter who they pledged allegiance to, except the fact that pledging allegiance to one party would offend the other party. Whether it was the Nine Nether Palace or the Blood Hawk Hall, it wasn’t something that they could confront individually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, when Tang Bing saw that those City Lords who were frightened by Mu Chen to the point that their hearts were wavering were, once again, scared by Luo Mang’s words, she instantly clenched her teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Luo Mang felt relieved in his heart as he sneered while looking at Mu Chen, who was up in the sky. “This new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace, we don’t want to make things this way. If you want us to pledge our allegiance to the Nine Nether Palace, you should seek the opinion of Lord Blood Hawk King, at the very least. If he agrees to it, we definitely won’t say a second word!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless gazes in this region were directed at Mu Chen. Now that the situation had come to this, if the new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace were to retreat this way, he would probably become the laughing stock in the entire Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And under the countless gazes, Mu Chen had a smear of a smile on his handsome face. He looked at Luo Mang and laughed, “Judging from your words, City Lord Luo Mang is not complying with the suggestion of my Nine Nether Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is not that I am not complying, I only want you to ask the opinion of Lord Blood Hawk King.” Luo Mang sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since that’s the case, then we have nothing else to speak about.” Mu Chen helplessly smiled as a chill swiftly piled up in his black pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed, looks like we have nothing to talk about.” Luo Mang stood up as well with his arms folded to his chest. His robust figure was exceptionally oppressive as he coldly stared at Mu Chen. Did this brat honestly think that he would be intimidated with those words? Did he, Luo Mang rely on his mouth to come this far?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This brat only has the strength of First Grade Sovereign and yet dares to act so impudent here. Does he really think that he has nothing to fear since he managed to defeat Cao Feng?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Mu Chen smiled as killing intent poured from his cold smile. He abruptly took a step forth as spiritual light poured out, along with a resonating draconic roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the draconic roar rang out, Mu Chen’s figure disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s figure disappeared, Luo Mang’s eyes trembled. He had retreated at nearly an instant. But when he was retreating, the space behind him seemed to have been torn apart as a draconic image flew out. A palm that was shrouded in purple flames heavily smashed towards Luo Mang’s back in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
