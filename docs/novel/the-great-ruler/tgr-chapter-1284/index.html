 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1284 - Mother and Son finally meet again</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A gift from my mother?” Mu Chen’s gaze flashed with joy from the depth of his eyes as he looked at Ling Xi. Clearly, the latter’s words had utterly aroused his interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a slight smile, she waved her hand and the blackstone beneath her dazzled before turning into a brilliant starry sky with specks of light, looking akin to stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen’s gaze was also fixated on the starry sky before he looked at the trajectory of the stars and vaguely felt a profound fluctuation slowly emanating from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, Aunt Jing had cultivated on this Spiritual Jade Island, so there is a lot of comprehension and experiences that she left behind in this piece of Spiritual Black Mirror. This is something that’s been left behind by a genuine Spiritual Array Ancestor, and it’s akin to a treasure for every Spiritual Array Master.” Ling Xi’s gaze was a little blurred as she looked at the starry sky and gently said, “For three years, I have been cultivating here until two months ago and broke through to High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Ling Xi, you have already reached High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar?” Mu Chen was shocked. When Ling Xi left, she was only a Spiritual Array Grandmaster. Yet, she had reached the High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar in just three years?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This surge was simply unheard of!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Before I lost my memories, my attainments were already near the Spiritual Array Scholar Realm… I have been recovering my memories in the past years, so my cultivation naturally recovered in addition to cultivating here and accepting Aunt Jing’s comprehension to allow me to have such swift increments.” Ling Xi smiled as she explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen had figured out what was going on, but he was still slowly digesting this information. That’s because Ling Xi already had an outstanding talent in Spiritual Arrays, in addition to the fact that she had followed his mother back then. So her starting point was unimaginable to ordinary people, not to mention that she had secluded herself to comprehend the experiences and comprehension that his mother had left behind. So it wasn’t too unbelievable for her to obtain such an achievement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More important, Ling Xi focused entirely on Spiritual Arrays, unlike him. Not only was he cultivating Spiritual Arrays, he even had to pay attention to Battle Formation Arrays and his own Spiritual Energy as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, it was natural that Ling Xi could surpassed him in the attainment of Spiritual Arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Xi nodded her head as she smiled. “Stay here for the time being to cultivate. I believe that it will be extremely beneficial to you. As to whether you can reach the High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar, it will have to depend on your own luck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen licked his lips with his eyes blazing in flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since his separation with Ling Xi, Mu Chen had been probing his ways in his Spiritual Array cultivation. Although he could be considered as a Spiritual Array Scholar, in terms of his foundation in Spiritual Arrays, he was still inferior when compared to Ling Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he could learn from the comprehension and experiences left by his mother, it was undoubtedly a valuable experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, even when he meets Gu Shihuang again, he would no longer have to use the Heavenly Emperor Sword to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the impatience in Mu Chen’s eyes, Ling Xi smiled before she elegantly stood up. “From now on, this place belongs to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen also wasn’t polite. He sat down on the floor and briefly exchanged a glance with Luo Li before gradually closing his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go. Let him submerge in his cultivation for this period.” Seeing that Mu Chen had entered his cultivation state, Ling Xi smiled towards Luo Li, held the latter’s hand and left the prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they left, this prison returned to silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen’s heart had also gradually calmed down, like a bottomless pond without any ripples…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the silence lasted for a long time, the sound of water dripping resounded, creating ripples in the silence. The ripples spread out, and Mu Chen could sense that his surroundings wer starting to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The starry sky had started to change with comets streaking across the horizon like a beautiful portrait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, starlight descended before Mu Chen and condensed into a silhouette. Her hair was loose and she had a gentle smile hanging on the corner of her lips. She had a kind appearance and graceful bearing that caused Mu Chen to be gradually stunned. “…Mother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with his composure, Mu Chen was dumbfounded when he saw her, since he never thought that he would be able to meet his mother here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this was merely a spiritual image, ever since the Northern Heavens Continent, he had never seen his mother again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My child…” While Mu Chen was dumbfounded, Qing Yanjing was also stunned while looking at Mu Chen. A brief moment later, he could see the tears flickering in her eyes before she swiftly moved up and gently hugged Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was merely a spiritual image, she was still linked to her main body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was hugged, Mu Chen’s mind, which had always been cool, turned a little stiff. When he was young, one thing he had been yearning for was the embrace of his mother, and yet, such a simple request couldn’t be fulfilled for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was merely a spiritual image, Mu Chen still felt an indescribable warmth rising up in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, even if his heart had been tempered over the years, his eyes still couldn’t help turning red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mu Chen, you have really grown…” After a long while , Qing Yanjing finally let Mu Chen go and started to look at him as if she didn’t want to miss any spot with a gratified smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen scratched his head and simply smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must have gone to the Spiritual Jade Island, since you can encounter this spiritual image of mine…” Qing Yanjing caressed his hair as she gently smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen nodded his head. “Big Sister Ling Xing said that you have left a gift to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Yanjing smiled. “Only you and Ling Xi can enter into this place, so I have left all my comprehension on Spiritual Arrays for the two of you here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She swept a glance at Mu Chen and said, “Show your strongest Spiritual Array to mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Steering back onto the main topic, Mu Chen felt excited in his heart and countless spiritual seals flew out like butterflies before they integrated into the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the spiritual seals integrated, a massive Spiritual Array started to gradually form, along with the roars of dragons echoing within the starry sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Spiritual Array was also the strongest Spiritual Array that Mu Chen could control at the moment, the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array, Qing Yanjing lightly nodded her head. “This Spiritual Array of yours is somewhat interesting. I never thought that your attainments in the path of the Spiritual Array would reach the level of a Middle Rank Spiritual Array Scholar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her voice sounded gratified, since Mu Chen had relied on himself to cultivate his Spiritual Arrays this far. In fact, Mu Chen could be considered as a son blessed by the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With your current level, you can be considered as having entered the foothold of Spiritual Arrays.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that even a Middle Rank Spiritual Array Scholar was merely considered as have entered the foothold to Qing Yanjing, Mu Chen couldn’t help inwardly smacking his lips. If it’s in the Greatlaw Continent, a Middle Rank Spiritual Array Scholar could even form his own sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, thinking about how his mother was a Spiritual Array Ancestor, he knew that the so-called “scholars” in her eyes were perhaps in the foothold in the path of Spiritual Arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your current attainments in Spiritual Arrays have also reached a small success, it’s just that your future path might be unfamiliar…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he heard those words, Mu Chen gently nodded his head. Qing Yanjing was probably speaking about the Ancestor Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Realm was something that even Mu Chen had no clue about how to comprehend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In general, all Spiritual Energy starts at linking with heaven and earth, borrowing the Spiritual Energy in nature to summon wind and rain… and you should also be in that stage yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The so-called ‘Ancestor Realm’ isn’t to link with heaven and earth, but create a world. A Spiritual Array that’s like a world where anyone entering it would be viewed as an enemy.” Qing Yanjing smiled. She then clenched her hand, and an exquisite palm-sized Spiritual Array appeared in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spiritual Array was extremely exquisite, but when Mu Chen looked at it, he felt his scalp going numb. He could sense the terrifying power contained in that tiny Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he entered that Spiritual Array, he would undoubtedly be dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So this is the legendary Ancestor Realm… to create a world with Spiritual Arrays, and anyone entering it will be viewed as an enemy by the world…” Mu Chen looked intoxicated. Qing Yanjing’s words had opened a brand new world in his mind. So it turned out that the higher-ranked Spiritual Arrays were actually so profound and unbelievable, no wonder those in the Ancestor Realm could compete with Heavenly Sovereigns!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how infatuated Mu Chen was, Qing Yanjing gently smiled before she stretched her finger and lightly tapped Mu Chen’s forehead. Instantly, boundless information endlessly poured into Mu Chen’s mind. This was all of her comprehension and experiences in the path of Spiritual Arrays!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Mu Chen could study and digest them, there would definitely be a great increment to his attainments in Spiritual Arrays, and it might even set a good foundation for him to reach the Ancestor Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light gradually enveloped Mu Chen, but he remained motionless, as if he had sunk into a deep sleep…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Far in the Ancient Buddha Clan, Qing Yanjing, who was seated, suddenly trembled and slowly opened her eyes before staring into the void with a gentle smile hanging on the corner of her lips. “Mu Chen… Mother will wait for the day when you become a Spiritual Array Ancestor…”</span></p>
