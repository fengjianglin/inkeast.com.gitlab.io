 <p><strong>Chapter 424 - Completing the Baptism</strong></p>
 <p>Within the Divine Spiritual Mountain</p>
 <p>The region that was originally wracked by chaotic battles had now become abnormally quiet as everyone present within had all sat down, continuously absorbing the golden raindrops fluttering down from the sky. Presently within them was the incomparably mysterious Strength of Baptism.</p>
 <p>As it went past the Nine Heavenly Steps, the Strength of Baptism became thin and diluted. However, there was not a single person that had forsaken any part of it, as everyone knew that if they could absorb just a bit more of it, they might gain an extra sliver of a opportunity to live when they attempt to pass through their “Three Sovereign Disasters” in the future. This was something that concerned their very survival, something that they definitely wouldn’t be sloppy or careless about.</p>
 <p>As everyone absorbed the Strength of Baptism descending from the skies, some envious gazes shot towards the position at the highest point in the Nine Heavenly Steps. Present there was the thin figure of a youth sitting quietly on the ground, with bright and resplendent golden light seemingly wanting to submerge his entire body into its brilliance. The boundless Strength of Baptism present there caused everyone’s eyes to turn red with envy. Nevertheless, they were unable to do anything about it, as all of them knew the difficulty and challenge of the fights that one would have to undergo to obtain that position. As for them, they clearly weren’t able to do such a thing.</p>
 <p>Therefore, feelings of respect were present, along with the envy they had for the youth, who was able to stand at the highest point in the Divine Spiritual Mountain’s Nine Heavenly Steps, where the number of experts were as numerous as the clouds in the skies.</p>
 <p>The students taught by the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy truly were formidable. Truly worthy of being one of the Five Great Academies.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen quietly sat on the top of the Nine Heavenly Steps, concentrating his mind and getting rid of all external influences. Golden rain drops continued to cover his entire body, before the Strength of Baptism that was endlessly flooding in entered his body.</p>
 <p>At this moment, golden light had already flooded everywhere within Mu Chen’s body. There were even faint rays of brilliance radiating from his blood and muscles. An indescribably comfortable and refreshing feeling surged within Mu Chen’s body. Although the Strength of Baptism wasn’t able to help Mu Chen with any increase in his strength, he was able to feel some kind of miraculous change happening within his body.</p>
 <p>This change was unquantifiable. However, Mu Chen knew that when he attempted his “Three Sovereign Disasters” in the future, he might be able to obtain a gigantic benefit then.</p>
 <p>Within his glowing golden body, slivers of a golden fluid started to seep through his blood, flesh and meridians, before flowing endlessly into his aurasea. Condensing within the small palm of the Divine Soul present there, golden light radiated out as the golden liquid continued to contract and condense. Within the innermost part, a golden crystal appeared to rapid condense and form.</p>
 <p>Humm.</p>
 <p>Upon accumulating to a certain degree, the golden rays of brilliance radiating out from Strength of Baptism within Mu Chen’s body started to gradually scatter away. All of the golden fluid quickly compressed together with the golden rays of brilliance, humming sounds resounded out as they did so. As the golden light gradually grew faint, a thumb-sized golden crystal surfaced within the palm of the Divine Soul.</p>
 <p>“Baptism Crystal.”</p>
 <p>Upon feeling this, happiness and elation erupted in Mu Chen’s mind. As long as he had the crystal condensed from the Strength of Baptism, he would have completed this Divine Spiritual Baptism in perfection.</p>
 <p>With a thought, Mu Chen’s Divine Soul opened its mouth. With a gentle suck, it absorbed the Baptism Crystal into its body, causing it to transform a ray of golden light as it entered the Divine Soul’s throat. After floating in the position of its heart, gentle rays of brilliance started to slowly merge with the Divine Soul, increasing its condensation rate within.</p>
 <p>“Success.”</p>
 <p>On the Nine Heavenly Steps, Mu Chen opened his eyes, golden light erupted from his black pupils. As the golden light slowly dissipated away, he took a heavy breath of relief. Although there wasn’t much increase in his strength, he could feel that his body had become much more light and springy, as if he had undergone a series of tempering and refining.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Mu Chen looked towards the sky, were vast and boundless golden raindrops were still falling down. There was clearly some more time till the end of the Baptism.</p>
 <p>Continuing to stare at this scene, Mu Chen didn’t stop with his cultivation. With a thought, suction force erupted once again. Having condensed a Baptism Crystal, meant that he had completed his Baptism. From the looks of it, he clearly had some time to condense a second crystal. Naturally, this was done for the sake for Luo Li.</p>
 <p>Although he knew about the background of Luo Li’s clan, the Luo God Clan, her chances of crossing her “Three Sovereign Disasters” would far exceed that of ordinary people, so it would be in her best interests for her to get another portion of safety. Coming to the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, she had given up the bitter training of the Luo God clan to quietly accompany his side. Although this was something that she had done willing, Mu Chen couldn’t be as heartless as to do nothing about it. He knew about how heavy the responsibility she had on her shoulders. If he could reduce her responsibility by just a little bit, he would go all-out to do so.</p>
 <p>The current him was still too weak. Faced against the Luo God Clan, which was a gargantuan existence, even more enormous than the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, he was unable to provide much help for Luo Li. Therefore, this was the only thing he could do to help Luo Li with her responsibilities.</p>
 <p>However, he also believed that there would be a day that he would possess the strength to stand right in front of Luo Li, helping her block every storm and rain that headed her way!</p>
 <p>Golden raindrops that blotted the skies condensed once again towards Mu Chen. Golden rays of brilliance started to come together and condense within his palm.</p>
 <p>Seeing those actions coming from Mu Chen, those experts could only sigh bitterly in anguish. <em>He really has no fear of drowning from too much of it.</em> All of them were at the bottom, only able to enjoy a limited amount of the Strength of Baptism. However, Mu Chen was already in the process of condensing a second Baptism Crystal. This truly made people open their eyes wide as they stared at him…However, after all of the bitter sighs, there wasn’t anyone that felt any anger or indignation. There’s no such thing as absolute equality in this world. Having relied on his own strength to stand at the highest position of the Nine Heavenly Steps, this showed that he had the qualifications necessary to enjoy the most amount of the Strength of Baptism. As long he possessed the strength, there wouldn’t be anyone that would complain, even if he were to devour all of it for himself.</p>
 <p>The golden rain in this region continued falling in a constant pace. This continued for about half an hour or so, before showing signs of stopping. As the experts started to successively open their eyes, feelings of regret and pity appeared within their gazes. They were clearly unable to complete their Baptisms as they could only absorb as much of the Strength of Baptism that was available for them to absorb, before preparing for their “Three Sovereign Disasters”.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xia Youran, Xi Qinghai and Su Buxiu had also opened their eyes, with inconcealable feelings of happiness and elation appearing on their faces. Clearly, they had managed to successfully condense their Baptism Crystals, completing this Divine Spiritual Baptism in the most perfect state.</p>
 <p>On the second highest step, the faces of Liu Ying, Dong Yuan and Zhou Xuan appeared somewhat ugly. Although their bodies were faintly radiating with a golden glow, they still had some distance to go before completing their Baptisms. Despite that, the Divine Spiritual Baptism was about to end, something that they were helpless to do anything about. The only thing they could blame was for choosing Mo Xingtian at the beginning…</p>
 <p>“That trash.”</p>
 <p>The bellies of all three men were filled with flames of anger as they shot a look at each other. Nevertheless, the only thing they could do was to send a vicious bout of curses towards Mo Xingtian. Since that fellow had been completely destroyed by Mu Chen, there was no more trouble that could happen from that.</p>
 <p>Across the horizon, the final bit of the Strength of Baptism was absorbed into Mu Chen’s palm. Golden light erupted from there, condensing together before a Baptism Crystal started to form.</p>
 <p>Rumble.</p>
 <p>As the golden crystal appeared, successive sounds of people gulping down their saliva rang out as countless people raised their heads as they stared at Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Seeing himself being stared at with wolf-like gazes, Mu Chen hastily stored the Baptism Crystal in his hands. <em>This one’s for my life. Don’t pin your hopes on it.</em></p>
 <p>“Haha. Congratulations.” A smile beamed across Xia Youran’s face as she congratulated Mu Chen, with not a single shred of envy or jealousy present. She had already completed her Baptism. Therefore, the Baptism Crystal had totally no use for her.</p>
 <p>“Many thanks for this, Brother Mu Chen.” both Xi Qinghai and Su Buxiu cupped their hands towards Mu Chen as they spoke out words filled with gratitude and emotion. Both of them knew that it was all due to Mu Chen that they were able to successfully complete their Baptism.</p>
 <p>With a smile, Mu Chen rebuked their words with a wave of his hand. However, just as he was about to reply to them, a ray of golden light suddenly shot down from the skies. As the golden light converged together, the surrounding space started to rapidly warp and distort, before transforming into a spatial whirlpool. This was the pathway to leave the Divine Spiritual Mountain. Obviously, upon the end of the Strength of Baptism, the Divine Spiritual Mountain was about to close up once again.</p>
 <p>Smacking his lips, Mu Chen shot a look towards the gigantic clump of light floating in the skies. Present within, there might just be the greatest secret of this Divine Spiritual Mountain. However, it was a pity that he was totally unable to conduct any investigations on it with his current level of strength. Perhaps, in the future, when he had become one of the peak-level experts in the Great Thousand Worlds, he might be able to conduct an investigation then.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Sending a smile towards Xia Youran and the others, Mu Chen took the lead, shooting towards the spatial whirlpool.</p>
 <p>Below him, countless people took the skies, getting ready to leave this place.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>However, just as they neared the spatial whirlpool, extremely rampant Spiritual Energy suddenly gushed out from it in a tyrannical fashion. Sweeping out, it instantly sent countless people into a pitiful state, with a few unlucky fellows being tossed thousands of feet away. In an instant, their faces turned deathly-pale, clearly suffering heavy injuries as a result of this impact.</p>
 <p>Reacting exceedingly quick, Mu Chen and the others evaded the strongest shockwave. Nevertheless, all of their faces were brimming with shock as uncertainty and doubt fluctuated in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?!”</p>
 <p>Countless whispers erupted as everyone’s faces were filled with shock and confusion.</p>
 <p>“There seems to be Sovereign level experts fighting outside of the Divine Spiritual Mountain!” A faint change appeared on Xia Youran’s face as she exclaimed in shock. The tyrannical fluctuations radiating from the spatial whirlpool absolutely matched those that could only be created by Sovereign-level experts.</p>
 <p>“Sovereign-level experts crossing hands?”</p>
 <p>With a gawk, Mu Chen’s face contorted as feelings of unease and worry erupted within his heart. There were not many Sovereign-level experts in the Northern Heavens Continent, resulting in all of them having a great restrictive effect on one another. Therefore, this resulted in the current situation where none of them would start a massive war against each other. If a war was to erupt outside of the Divine Spiritual Mountain, the highest possibility would be between two peak-level influences, which would most likely be between the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy and the Demonic Dragon Palace. Furthermore, added with the fact that he had just killed Mo Xingtian earlier…</p>
 <p>Complicated expressions flashed across Mu Chen’s face. With a move of his body, Mu Chen shot rapidly towards the spatial whirlpool. As his head entered the whirlpool, his faces turned dark as he clenched his teeth. <em>It’s best that this fight doesn’t involve Luo Li. If not, I don’t care if you’re from the Demonic Dragon Palace or not! I’ll make sure every single one of you will go and accompany Mo Xingtian!</em></p>
