 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1244 - Ghost Master</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Mu Chen had expected, his fame spread out a day later. Mu Chen couldn’t even figure out how those cautious fellows exchanged their information…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this would cause trouble for Mu Chen, since he realised that even if someone came to him after he set up his Spiritual Array and waited, the moment his prey saw the Spiritual Array around him, they would briefly hesitate before retreating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, they would still look down on Mu Chen’s cultivation at the Lesser Earth Sovereign Realm. But after knowing that Mu Chen was a Middle Rank Spiritual Array Scholar, his Spiritual Array was something that could even threaten a Greater Earth Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Great Thousand World, it’s common knowledge not to fight with a well-prepared Spiritual Array Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, no one would dare to enter a myriad foot around Mu Chen as long as they’re not stupid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his identity as a Spiritual Array Scholar exposed, it had given Mu Chen a significant intimidation, which wasn’t good news for the current Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to obtain Battle Seals, so he had to defeat his competitors, and none of those cunning foxes dared to enter the range of the Spiritual Array; causing him to feel helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, his trump card wasn’t only the Spiritual Array. So unless one of his trump cards was no longer capable of dealing with his opponent, he had no intention to reveal his other trump cards. Sometimes, catching the opponent by surprise was also an advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So, over the next two days, Mu Chen wasn’t able to obtain even one Battle Seal. Naturally, there was a Greater Earth Sovereign that tried his luck, but Mu Chen wasn’t able to obstruct him, since that person was too slippery, possessing a Saint Artifact that could shuttle through space. So when that Greater Earth Sovereign saw that the situation wasn’t good for him, he instantly fled and Mu Chen couldn’t even stop him from doing so, he even had to witness his prey fleeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through this battle, Mu Chen’s fame rose again, and no one dared to provoke him. Although there was the occasional Greater Earth Sovereign here and there, they only cast a look at him from afar before leaving immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Mu Chen could only look at his empty Spiritual Array and sigh. Despite being helpless, Mu Chen wasn’t anxious, since he knew that more Greater Earth Sovereigns were being eliminated in the cruel battle. Those that remained would all be elites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although those elites might still be fearful of Mu Chen, they wouldn’t be like those cowardly fellows. Furthermore, they would definitely keep an eye out, and the moment a flaw appeared, they would surely launch an assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a boundless ocean with towering mountains that broke through the surface of the sea. They were akin to sharp blades that stood out of the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Mu Chen sat quietly on one of the mountains with space violently fluctuating a few myriad feet around him. He could vaguely sense countless stars. This was a powerful Spiritual Array that was hidden within the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Spiritual Energy whistled into the Spiritual Array, high waves would lift from the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a break of wind that resounded from the distance before a silhouette stepped over and stopped a hundred miles away from Mu Chen. After a brief hesitation, that silhouette also turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at that silhouette, Mu Chen’s gaze flickered. He could sense a tremendous pressure of Spiritual Energy that was much stronger than the Firecloud King and Purple Mound Sect Master coming from the silhouette.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The standard is getting higher…” &nbsp;Mu Chen muttered to himself. He had been meeting Greater Earth Sovereigns of higher standards over the past two days. Evidently, none of them were pushovers, since they could remain in this battlefield through the cruel elimination rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since that’s the case… then the time is almost here.” Mu Chen flicked his finger. With the Greater Earth Sovereigns that remained in the battlefield getting stronger, the intimidation of the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array was also weakening. He could sense that there had been many people that tried to look for a flaw in the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That also meant that the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array was losing its intimidation, and according to his estimations, there would probably be someone making a move against him in less than a day…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about it, Mu Chen faintly smiled before he slowly closed his eyes. He wanted to see who would be confident enough to make a move against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, one day swiftly passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tidal waves slammed against the mountains, which caused an ear-shattering noise that spread throughout the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Opening his eyes, a spiritual light flashed in Mu Chen’s black pupils before it gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze was faintly directed at some of the distant islands. He could vaguely sense several Spiritual Energy fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was additional killing intent in the atmosphere of this region and they seemed to originate from those preying gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Mu Chen was akin to a wolf in a streak of tigers. The moment he revealed a flaw, Mu Chen believed that those fellows would immediately swarm over to try and seize the Battle Seals from his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were cautious, and they wouldn’t stand out by themselves. Thus, they would definitely wait for an opportunity to arise…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As sunlight shone down on this ocean, the ocean reflected the rays of light, which was a gorgeous scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the surface of the ocean, which was glittering with lustre, Mu Chen’s gaze suddenly narrowed before he raised his head. The sea in that direction was swiftly turning crimson as it turned into a myriad foot of waves as it rolled out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a few breaths’ time, the crimson wave appeared a few myriad feet away from Mu Chen before it slowly stopped at the border of the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crimson-robed silhouette appeared. It was a familiar figure, Xue Lingzi of the Blood God Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he was coldly looking at Mu Chen, akin to looking prey with brutality and ruthlessness in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it’s the old dog…” Seeing that figure, Mu Chen was briefly stunned before he laughed out, “I had vaguely sensed your existence for the past two days, but you have been hiding like a mouse. So why are you showing yourself now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, your death is already in the corner, and you're still stubborn!” Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Xue Lingzi’s face turned cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his eyelids, Mu Chen faintly replied, “It’s uncertain if I will die, but I can guarantee that you will be the one that’s in a disaster today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was calm, but it contained unconcealable killing intent. Mu Chen already had the intention to get rid of Xue Lingzi, since he heard that Luo Li’s father died in the hands of Xue Lingzi, even Luo Tianshen was poisoned by him a long time ago. When Luo Li returned to the Luo God Clan, it was because of Xue Lingzi that she had to be under such enormous pressure and even faced the threat of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From a certain degree, Xue Lingzi was the mortal enemy of the Luo God Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Luo Li did not show her hatred for Xue Lingzi before him, Mu Chen could sense that she didn’t want Mu Chen to take the risk. Thus, she had been suppressing the emotions in her heart and wanted to wait until she grew up to take vengeance for herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to all that, Mu Chen was naturally filled with killing intent for Xue Lingzi as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he entered the battlefield, he had already made up his mind to look for an opportunity to get rid of Xue Lingzi, and since the latter had come knocking on his door, things had gone as Mu Chen wished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh, what a foolish brat!” Xue Lingzi mocked before he eerily said, “But did you think that you can be arrogant with a Middle Rank Scholar Grade Spiritual Array?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you think that there isn’t any Spiritual Array Scholar in our West Heaven Continent?” He waved his hand and a black light flickered beside him. A skinny grey-robed old man appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the grey-robed old man appeared, his eyes looked at the Nine Dragon God-Killing Array around Mu Chen with a dark light flickering before nodding his head with a smile. “It truly is a Middle Rank Scholar Grade Spiritual Array, no wonder no one dares to make a move against him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, the Ghost Master has been famous for many years and you have immersed yourself in many Middle Rank Scholar Grade Spiritual Arrays, so how can a brat be comparable to you in terms of attainments?” Xue Lingzi smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Master chuckled, “Xue Lingzi, let's stop wasting time. I can help you suppress this Spiritual Array, but half of the Battle Seals on the brat will go to me, and you even have to pay me a Battle Seal as payment.”</span></p>
