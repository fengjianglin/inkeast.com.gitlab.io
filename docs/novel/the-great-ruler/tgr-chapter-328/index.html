 <p><strong>Chapter 328 - Blood Battle</strong></p>
 <p>On the giant peak, destructive fluctuations gushed out from Mu Chen’s body as low and deep rumbles of thunder continuously rang out from within him. As those sounds resounded, even the sky seemed to turn dark and overcast.</p>
 <p>Countless gazes converged on Mu Chen’s body, which was covered in black lightning liquid that was flowing across the entire surface of his body. Due to the successive shocks and astonishment they had received from him, the faces of a large number of people started to gradually turn calm. Instead, their gazes towards Mu Chen started to turn peculiar and weird, since the latter’s performance had exceeded far beyond their expectations…</p>
 <p>“Are the current Freshmen strong to such a level?” the gazes of Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan had also turned strange. They never imagined that a Freshman, whose strength was only at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase, would actually be able to force Gu Tianyan to such a miserable state.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, the gazes of Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong in the distance, intersected for a moment. Obviously, they were also unable to understand the hidden cards that Mu Chen had now displayed.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of that, to them, this was not bad news.</p>
 <p>The fight in front of them had seemingly turned slightly towards Mu Chen’s favor.</p>
 <p>Staring at Mu Chen, whose current appearance had become somewhat terrifying, Gu Tianyan’s eyes turned increasingly solemn and grave. At this moment, the destructive fluctuations radiating from the former’s body had made his heart start to palpitate and tremble.</p>
 <p>Strength of such a level shouldn’t appear on the body of a Freshman, whose strength was only at the level of a Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase.</p>
 <p>Taking in a deep breath, scarlet-red Spiritual Energy curled onto his arms, akin to raging flames. Across the horizon, boundless scarlet-red Spiritual Energy swept out, akin to a prairie full of heavenly fire.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he could no longer continue to show any mercy.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>As boundless Spiritual Energy gushed out of Gu Tianyan’s body, Mu Chen, who was completely covered in the black lightning liquid, had already taken a step forward. Instantly, the earth tremble as peals of thunder resounded. Akin to a black bolt of lightning, Mu Chen instantly shot out.</p>
 <p>Looking at the black bolt of lightning heading his way, while radiating with devastating fluctuations, Gu Tianyan’s eyes instantly narrowed. With a clench of his hands, scarlet-red Spiritual Energy erupted out, before transforming into a long flaming spear in his hands.</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>As a tremble shook through his arms, the long flaming spear transformed into a fiery streak of light. Shattering space, while carrying along violent and explosive fluctuations, it fiercely shot towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Facing the berserking fiery long spear flying explosively towards him, Mu Chen did not show any sign of wanting to give way to it. Clenching his hand tightly to form a fist, the black lightning liquid enveloped his fist, which he violently sent rumbling towards the fiery long spear.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As they violently collided, the fiery spear, which was capable of piercing through an expert at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase, was directly sent shooting away by Mu Chen’s fist, before transforming in fluttering scarlet-red bits that blotted the sky. In the next moment, Mu Chen’s figure travelled through the plume that was created. In a flash, he had already arrived right in front of Gu Tianyan.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Without the slightest courtesy and hesitation, Mu Chen’s black lightning liquid-covered fists howled. Transforming into shades, they hid the skies and covered the earth as they hurtled towards Gu Tianyan.</p>
 <p>Every single fist sent out was abnormally frightening, with even the surrounding space showing slight traces of distortion.</p>
 <p>If it was before, Gu Tianyan might have commented on Mu Chen’s stupidity for wanting to engage in close-quarter-combat. After all, the difference in strength between the two of them was too large. Mu Chen could only rely on special methods to defeat him. In a head-on confrontation, the latter would lose without a doubt.</p>
 <p>However, facing the attacks that Mu Chen had launched at him now, Gu Tianyan did not dare to show the slightest negligence. The current Mu Chen, who was enveloped in the black lightning liquid, was too terrifying! The strength radiating from the former was to such a degree that made even him feel a sliver of dread.</p>
 <p>Boundless scarlet-red Spiritual Energy erratically gushed out from Gu Tianyan’s body. In an instant, his arms were covered in a majestic layer of scarlet-red crystals; the embodiment of the degree of condensation of his Spiritual Energy.</p>
 <p>After unleashing all of the Spiritual Energy within his body without any restraint, Gu Tianyan’s gaze started to turn scorchingly hot, and fighting intent erupted from his eyes.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A howl resounded from his throat as he too took a step forward. Sending his fists howling out, they seemed to have transformed into a boundless sea of fighting intent as they violently rumbled out.</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
 <p>Seemingly in an instant, fists of the two collided into each other. Akin to meteors striking the earth, they erupted with extremely astonishing erratic fluctuations.</p>
 <p>Everyone watching could only see the black lighting, as well as the scarlet-red Spiritual Energy, frantically erupting about, and the figures of the two violently collided into one another. As fist shadows dissipated, everyone could see the deep and enormous holes that they created around the surrounding earth.</p>
 <p>Countless people became tongue-tied as they watched the crazily clashing figures hidden behind the the erratic eruption of Spiritual Energy.The raw confrontation when fists smashed against flesh caused the hearts of countless people to feel fear and trepidation.</p>
 <p>No one would have guess that this fight would be violent and ferocious to such a degree.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Under the countless gazes that showed fear and trepidation, the fists of the two, whose eyes had already turn red, violently smashed against each other in the erratic eruption of Spiritual Energy.</p>
 <p>Shock waves visible to the naked-eye swept out, and the entire stretch of the earth there instantly cracked and shattered.</p>
 <p>Bang! Rumble!</p>
 <p>Destructive black lightning seemed to flash within Mu Chen’s eyes as the black lightning liquid started to squirm and wriggle on his arm, causing destructive energies to gush out from within.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Once again, Mu Chen’s black lightning-covered fist smashed straight against Gu Tianyan’s scarlet-red crystal-covered fist.</p>
 <p>Black-coloured ripples radiated out as Gu Tianyan’s face instantly changed, some cracks had, unexpectedly, started to appear on the scarlet-red crystal on his fist.</p>
 <p>The destructive fluctuations within the black lightning liquid continued to ceaselessly pervade him. Under these destructive fluctuations, the Spiritual Energy within Gu Tianyan’s body started to rapidly get destroyed and defeated.</p>
 <p>“Go back!”</p>
 <p>A hoarse roar furiously rang out from Mu Chen’s mouth, causing the black ripples to violently tremble. Instantly, the crystal layer on Gu Tianyan’s arm completely shattered, while his body was flung back a thousand metres by the former’s fist.</p>
 <p>As Gu Tianyan was sent flying, Mu Chen’s feet dug deep into the hard rock ground below him by the rebounding force, causing him to almost flip backwards.</p>
 <p>“He sent Gu Tianyan flying yet again!”</p>
 <p>Shocked, clamoring voices rang out once again from the surroundings of the Spiritual Light Mountain as excitement and strong emotions surfaced within the eyes of countless students. No one would have imagined that the current Mu Chen would be frightening to the point he was actually able to send Gu Tianyan retreating in a head-on confrontation.</p>
 <p>Under the soaring atmosphere, Mu Chen pressed his hands on the ground, and pulled himself out from the earth as a bit of the black lightning liquid flowed out.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, he looked towards Gu Tianyan, who he had sent flying. At this moment, there weren’t any traces left of the initial expression he had in the beginning of the fight, since blood was continuously dripping from his arms. Not only was his clothing tattered, his head of fiery-red hair had turned messy and charcoal black.</p>
 <p>The energy contained by shattering that black lightning bead had far exceeded Mu Chen’s expectations. This energy was too terrifying. Even with him learning the Lightning God’s Physique, there were still some pretty serious internal injuries within his body.</p>
 <p>Thinking about it, if he didn’t learn the Lightning God’s Physique, and possessed the ability granted by it to absorb the strength of lightning to temper his fleshly body, the current him would’ve been completely fried by the energy of the black lightning and turn into ashes.</p>
 <p>Regardless of that, he was unable to maintain this state for too long. As of now, his current body was simply unable to endure the devastating black lightning that was wreaking havoc.</p>
 <p>“I have to end this fast.”</p>
 <p>Instead of succumbing to the intense pain radiating from within his body, it had caused Mu Chen to maintain his calmness at all times. Eyes sparkling, he did not allow the advantage that he seemed to have gained to flood his mind, as he firmly decided to prevent this fight from dragging on any longer.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Just as this thought flashed past Mu Chen’s mind, an exceedingly erratic Spiritual Energy fluctuation suddenly rushed to the heavens in the far away sky. Raising his head, Mu Chen saw that the horizon present before him had already turned into a purgatory of flames.</p>
 <p>Under the burning horizon, Gu Tianyan stood erect. As of now, his eyes were scarlet-red, as if flames had erupted from them. Staring tightly at Mu Chen, a hoarse sound rang throughout the horizon.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, with your strength at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase, you’re the first person that is able to force me to such a stage!”</p>
 <p>“I admired your capabilities! In this fight today, if you’re able to receive this move of mine, it’ll be considered your victory!”</p>
 <p>Upon shouting those words, Gu Tianyan did not show the slightest hesitation. Rapidly placing his hands together, he formed a seal. Following the seal’s formation. The scarlet-red Spiritual Energy that blotted the horizon hid the skies and covered the earth as they rapidly converged in his hands.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>As the scarlet-red Spiritual Energy crazily converged, a scarlet-red halberd, approximately ten metres long, was faintly discernable as it finally formed within Gu Tianyan’s hands.</p>
 <p>The long halberd was akin to a twisting fiery dragon, looking exceedingly malevolent and sinister. It’s entire body was scarlet-red, as if it was made entirely of scarlet-red crystals. As the fiery dragon slowly wriggled and squirmed, indescribably erratic fluctuations started to ripple and undulate.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>As the fiery dragon roared, the entire stretch of the world seemed to be in a fiery and scorching state.</p>
 <p>“He even had to use <em>that</em> move…” the eyes of both Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan contracted. Both of them had deep understanding of Gu Tianyan, and naturally had ample knowledge of his skills and abilities. The move the latter was using right now was considered the strongest attack in his arsenal.</p>
 <p>At the beginning of the fight, who would have expected that Gu Tianyan, who had victory grasped within his hands, would be forced to such a stage?</p>
 <p>Both Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had also raised their heads and stared gravely at the horizon. Anyone could tell that at this stage of the fight, both parties had already brought out all of their trump cards. In this fight today, even if Mu Chen were to lose, there would be absolutely no one that would mutter half a word of doubt…</p>
 <p>“Looks like this is his final move.”</p>
 <p>Following the appearance of the fiery dragon halberd, Gu Tianyan’s face turned somewhat pale. As his scarlet-red eyes stared at Mu Chen, he furiously took a step forward. As a tremble shook through his arm, the long halberd erupted with scarlet-red light that blotted the skies.</p>
 <p>“Great Heavenly Fiery Dragon Halberd!”</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Within the sea of flames, a dragon roar seemed to resound as the flames that blotted the sky erupted out. Transforming into a scarlet streak of light, the fiery dragon halberd shot across the horizon, before enveloping Mu Chen within its light.</p>
 <p>Within the scarlet streak of light, the fiery dragon spread its jaws and claws open as the dragon roar shook the earth.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Mu Chen looked at the scorching gale blowing at him, causing the earth around him to be roasted to the point of cracking and shattering. Within his black eyes, the destructive black lightning started to grow increasingly erratic.</p>
 <p>Placing his palms together, the black lightning liquid started to flow within his palms, before fiercely forming a seal with his hands.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Spiritual Energy erupted from his back, before transforming into a starry sky. Within the starry sky, Spiritual Energy the blotted the sky gushed out as a tiger and a tortoise stepped out from within, appearing simultaneously.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Moo!</p>
 <p>As they roared and howled together, countless nervous and emotional gazes immediately swept over, while noticing the black lightning twisting and arching around their bodies.</p>
 <p>A dragon, a tiger and a tortoise.</p>
 <p>Shattering the skies, under the gazes of countless people who were close to suffocating under their pent up breaths, they furiously collided against each other!</p>
