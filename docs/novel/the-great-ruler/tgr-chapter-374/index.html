 <p><strong>Chapter 374 - Trump Cards Revealing</strong></p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Brimming with boundless Spiritual Energy, the two gigantic black lotuses started to slowly revolve, radiating a powerful pressure that enveloped across the entire Western Desolated City.</p>
 <p>The expressions of countless people faintly changed due to the two gigantic black lotuses, since they had sensed the formidability and might of Mu Chen’s Spiritual Array. From the pressure and Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiating from it, even a Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase expert would be left with the only option to temporarily retreat from it.</p>
 <p>Indeed, this youth by the name of Mu Chen truly had some ability. It’s no wonder why he’s able to defeat Wu Jia. It looked like his attainments on the aspect of Spiritual Arrays wasn’t lower than the latter. In fact, he might even be more tyrannical.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>While countless people were sighing in admiration towards Mu Chen’s abilities, the two gigantic malevolent dragons had already howled over, their roars shaking the entire stretch of the world.</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>The two gigantic black lotuses started to rapidly revolve. Under the cold and chilling gaze from Mu Chen, two gigantic rays of black light spewed out all of the sudden right from the centre of both lotuses. They intertwined together, appearing similar to two black dragons that had entangled with one another as indescribably overbearing and tyrannical energies radiated from them.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Under the attentive gazes from everyone, the two rays of black light violently smashed against the bodies of the two demonic dragons. A black light instantly blossomed across the horizon, covering and shrouding over the entire sky.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Painful roars erupted from the two demonic dragons as they did everything they could to struggle and escape. Nevertheless, under the rays of the black light, which appeared to be as dense as ink, they started to corrode, before turning incorporeal.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As a loud bang rang out, the two demonic dragons were pierced right through by the ink-like rays of black light. Furthermore, the rays of light continued on with their assault. Without appearing to have weakened, they violently shot over towards Mo Longzi as they enveloped over him.</p>
 <p>A clamor rang out across the entire city.</p>
 <p>A dark and cold expression appeared on Mo Longzi’s face as he looked towards the black rays of light shooting over towards him. He was able to sense that the powerful energies contained within them were sufficient to smash and defeat a person at the Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase.</p>
 <p>However, it was a pity that he, Mo Longzi, was much, much stronger than a Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase.</p>
 <p>As a dark shadow erupted from Mo Longzi’s eyes, he took a step out. Dense greyish-black Spiritual Energy erupted from his arms as layers of black scales surfaced on his skin.</p>
 <p>“Scram off!”</p>
 <p>A cold roar rang out from Mo Longzi as he sent two fists rumbling out. The air before him instantaneously exploded, while ripples undulated across the surrounding space. Without the slightest intent of evading, Mo Longzi’s fists heavily impacted against the two black rays of light that were shooting towards him.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Rings of rampaging Spiritual Energy ripples were seen spreading out by everyone as Mo Longzi was sent retreating a dozen steps back. The sleeves around his arms were torn into tatters. However, not a single injury was present on his arm. Furthermore, from the head-on confrontation, the black rays of light that seemed to be an irresistible force were immediately shattered into glowing dots that blotted the sky.</p>
 <p>This Mo Longzi’s strength was actually on the level that could easily resist a Fifth Grade Spiritual Array!</p>
 <p>Shock erupted within the hearts of countless people as everyone thought, <em>This Mo Longzi is indeed extremely formidable and powerful.</em> Although Mu Chen had used the strength of a Fifth Grade Spiritual Array Master, the degree of the Spiritual Array arranged by him was unable to cope with Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>Grave expressions filled the faces of Su Xuan, He Yao and the rest. All of them had seen the might of Mu Chen’s Demonic Butchering Lotus Spiritual Array. However, they never expected that a Spiritual Array of such might was, in all, only able to force Mo Longzi to retreat, nothing more than that.</p>
 <p>“It seems like it’s very difficult for Mu Chen to be Mo Longzi’s match.” Xu Huang whispered.</p>
 <p>“As long as he can endure till Luo Li and Li Xuantong finish of their opponents, with the collaboration of the three of them, they’ll have some chance of victory.” He Yao chimed in while wrinkling his forehead. However, with Mo Longzi’s level of intellect, he would clearly not give Mu Chen such a chance.</p>
 <p>He would definitely end this fight as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>“This fellow…” Mu Chen’s eyes had narrowed as a result of seeing the spectacle that had played before his eyes. This was truly the first time that his Demonic Butchering Lotus Spiritual Array was unable to have its desired effect. The strength of this Mo Longzi was truly very powerful and formidable.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Mo Longzi sent a chillingly dark smile towards Mu Chen. In the next instant, in a flash, he appeared right before Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Having raised his vigilance against him, the dragon’s shadow around Mu Chen’s body sparkled as he explosively retreated hundreds of metres back. At the same time, with a change of his hand seal, the two giant black lotuses that had yet to dissipate started to revolve once again, sending two black rays of light violently shooting out.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi’s fists rumbled out again, smashing the two incoming rays of light apart while being forced to retreat a dozen steps back once again. However, this time, he gave a violent stomp with his feet, making his speed increase dramatically, causing remnant shadows to appear across the sky.</p>
 <p>In the short span of a blink of an eye, he had appeared right before Mu Chen like a specter. As the chillingly dark sneer turned somewhat malevolent, he spoke out, “ Do you truly thinking that you’ll be able to avoid me with your small accomplishment in the Soaring Dragon Technique?”</p>
 <p>Clenching his fingers tightly together, the black scales on his fist sparkled with a sinisterly cold light, appearing akin to a weapon of slaughter and carnage, while chilling and erratic fluctuations radiating out.</p>
 <p>“Dragon Breaking Fist!”</p>
 <p>A low roar rang out from Mo Longzi’s mouth as he sent his fist rumbling out. The air in front instantly shattered and exploded as the fist went straight for Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>At this distance, Mu Chen was already unable to attempt any form of evasion. A fierce expression flashed within his black pupils as black lightning raced and erupted from his body, while a lightning rune surfaced on his chest.</p>
 <p>Activating his Lightning God’s Physique, Mu Chen turned his body, sending a fist violently rumbling out, and smashed it straight against the fist coming from Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Ripples visible the naked-eye extended out seemingly at the instant when the two fists smashed against each other. Vibrations shook the surrounding space as the Spiritual Energy surging forth from the two had seemingly transformed into violent storms.</p>
 <p>A shudder went through Mu Chen as he went flying back hundreds of metres. A faintly sweet taste appeared in his mouth as a sliver of blood appeared as it flowed down from the corner of his mouth. After all, his strength was only at the level of Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase. Although he had the reinforcement from his Lightning God Physique, in such a head-on collision of strength, he obviously wasn’t Mo Longzi’s match.</p>
 <p>Standing arrogantly in the air, Mo Longzi didn’t move a single inch from the earlier collision, with only a tremble of his shoulder, which was dealt with by the energy within his body. Looking with ridicule and contempt at Mu Chen, he spoke towards the latter, “You’re truly a crazily arrogant brat. You actually dared to fight head-on with me. Looks like you’ve no regards for your life.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words and seeing Mo Longzi’s reactions towards the earlier exchange, Mu Chen’s expression sank like a brick in water. The disparity between Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase and Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase was truthfully far too large. Even with all the various methods he had used, he was struggling with much difficulty.</p>
 <p>Wanting to truly become a threat to Mo Longzi using ordinary methods was simply impossible.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s eyes started to sparkle as he pondered on the methods and ways he could use.</p>
 <p>Obviously, Mo Longzi wasn’t going to foolishly wait for Mu Chen to complete his preparations. With a sneer, he shot out once again, yet again displaying that astonishing speed. Hiding the skies and covering the earth, a furious barrage of attacks swept towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>In response, Mu Chen could only twist and turn his body to evade the incoming attacks. However, there were many instances where he was forced by Mo Longzi’s absolutely tyrannical strength to meet in a head-on confrontation of power. Therefore, under this assault, Mu Chen quickly fell into a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>Within the city, countless people sighed in admiration within their hearts, since Mo Longzi truly was the more formidable one. Although that Mu Chen had caused people to feel shock and astonishment by his combat prowess, the disparity between one full stage wasn’t that easy to be supplemented.</p>
 <p>The faces of Su Xuan, He Yao and the rest were brimming with anxiousness, because once Mu Chen falls, they would no longer have the chance to reverse the entire situation around any more.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Low and deep sounds continued to ring out across the sky. Following every sound, Mu Chen would be sent miserably flying back, while the blood dripping down from the corners of his mouth became increasingly prominent.</p>
 <p>However, every single time when Mu Chen was miserably sent flying back, the palms within his sleeves would intensely tremble, before light would flow out of his finger tips. As this happened, the air would faintly ripple, before returning to its original, undisturbed state.</p>
 <p>In the air, Mu Chen’s situation became increasingly miserable and dire. Being forced to flee in all directions by Mo Longzi, cries of pity and mocking laughter started to ring out within the city. However, after hearing those noises, frustration and unwillingness were surprisingly absent from the black eyes of the youth. On the contrary, a chilling calmness akin to the bottom of an ancient lake was present.</p>
 <p>Seeing the blood flowing down from the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth, Su Xuan couldn’t help covering her mouth with her jade-like hands, while an impulsion to help him erupted within her heart. However, at this very moment, the other cruel people from the Bounty List Rankings were tightly staring at them.</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, Mu Chen seemed to be unable to hold on for much longer.</p>
 <p>Within the large hall, the green-robed male faintly narrowed his eyes as he stared at the scene of Mo Longzi seemingly dominating over Mu Chen. Faintly wrinkling his forehead, he seemed to have discovered that wasn’t quite right.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>In the sky, Mo Longzi’s spectre-like figure appeared before Mu Chen once again. With a face filled with gloom, he sent another fist rumbling towards Mu Chen’s throat, causing the latter to cross his arms in front of his body in defense.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi’s fist violently slammed against Mu Chen arms, causing a mouthful of blood to spurt out from the latter as intense pain racked his arm. If not for him having cultivated his Lightning God’s Physique, his arms would definitely be maimed after receiving that attack.</p>
 <p>Relying on the force of the blow, Mu Chen explosively retreated, his fingertips still vibrating, while fluctuations radiated within the air.</p>
 <p>The blood flowing down from the corner of his mouth was now clear and prominent, with only the chilling expression within those pair of black pupils growing increasingly thicker.</p>
 <p>After stabilising his body after backing off a couple hundred feet, Mu Chen slowly cleaned away the blood from the corner of his mouth before proceeding to chillingly glare at Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>“You’re truly a tenacious brat. Looks like the body refinement divine art that you’ve cultivated is quite formidable.” said Mo Longzi with a sinister laugh. If he was replaced by an ordinary person, even someone whose strength was at the Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase would have already long suffered heavy injuries after being smashed so many times by him. However, although the Mu Chen before his eyes appeared rather miserable, he clearly still possessed the capability to continue fighting.</p>
 <p>“Nevertheless, I really want to see, exactly how many more punches you can take from me!”</p>
 <p>A malevolent laugh rang out from Mo Longzi as he took a step out, wanting to continue his assault to finish Mu Chen off.</p>
 <p>However, just as he was able to take another step forward, a chilling smile bursting within killing intent surfaced from the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth in the far distance. At this moment, those pair of black pupils had turned crystalline, seemingly able to see through the myriad of every living thing in the world, appearing exceedingly mysterious.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>Astonishing fluctuations rang out across the world, shocking and astonishing countless people to raise their heads, only to see the Spiritual Energy in the sky above them seemingly starting to rampage about. Countless glowing lines started to come together within the air, before spreading out. From the looks of it, they appeared to form an incomparably gigantic furnace.</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi’s eyes instantly contracted faintly as he looked at the spectacle unfurling around him, causing his expression to slowly start sinking.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Mu Chen looked towards Mo Longzi, who had a sunken expression hanging on his face. In the next instant, an extremely chilling voice containing some ridiculement within resounded across the sky.</p>
 <p>“Did you really think I was allowing you to freely hit me, you trash?”</p>
