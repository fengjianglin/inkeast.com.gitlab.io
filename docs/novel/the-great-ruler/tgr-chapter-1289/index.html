 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1289 - Acquaintance</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, Qin Tian is the Grand Elder of the Great Thousand Palace. Before the next Palace Master appears in the Great Thousand Palace, he is in charge of everything in the Great Thousand Palace. Perhaps his name resounded as much as the Flame Emperor, and the Martial Ancestor in the Great Thousand World, his fame amongst the Heavenly Sovereigns isn’t any weaker than the two of them.” Celestial Chi Yan rubbed his beard and sighed while Mu Chen’s group was left shocked by Demon Slayer King Qin Tian’s shocking achievements. Even Mu Chen and the rest could hear the respect in his tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. Although he hadn’t met this Demon Slayer King Qin Tian, since he could obtain such a high standing amongst the Heavenly Sovereigns, he must be extremely powerful. He was so much so that he might even be comparable to the Flame Emperor and Martial Ancestor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Thousand World was truly a place with hidden dragons and crouching tigers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Chi Yan, how are we going to obtain this Demon Slayer Token, then?” Mu Chen asked. Clearly, he was also moved by the benefits from the Demon Slayer Token. Not only could it grant them the title as a Guest of the Great Thousand Palace, but they could also even use it to exchange for Peerless Divine Abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, aside from the Three Pures, he had no other Peerless Divine Abilities. If he could obtain it from the Great Thousand Palace, it would surely be a great boost to his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the interest rising in Mu Chen’s group, Celestial Chi Yan smiled before he turned to the center of the city, with Mu Chen and the rest following behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group swiftly passed through the city, and nearly half an hour later, Celestial Chi Yan slowed down his steps and everyone realised that they were already standing beneath the Demon Slayer Plaque. There was a black pavilion beneath the plaque that emanated a heavy pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the Great Thousand Pavilion, part of the Great Thousand Palace that has a hold in the Sacred Abyss Continent to observe the Fiend Clan’s movements.” Celestial Chi Yan said as he pointed at the black pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Celestial Chi Yan finished speaking, he walked towards the Great Thousand Pavilion with Mu Chen and the rest following behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the group had entered the Great Thousand Pavilion, their view instantly widened. The first level was extremely massive, with crystals floating in the sky that emanated light to illuminate the entire pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a massive corner of the pavilion, it was akin to a restaurant with people coming and going with all sorts of noises. When Mu Chen directed his gaze over, his gaze slightly narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen could tell that most of them emanated powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations. Furthermore, there was killing intent flowing amongst the fluctuations and all of them must have gone through battles of life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the group entered, they had also attracted many people’s attention. But evidently, most of their attention was focused on Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Luo Li’s appearance and bearing made her the focus of attention, no matter where she went, not to mention that compared to the ordinary shocked gazes, the gazes from those people were somewhat unrestrained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing those gazes, Luo Li’s brows slightly knitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before she could say anything, Mu Chen stood before her to block those gazes. At the same time, he also stared at that region without any expression, and his black pupils flickering with killing intent leaking out from the center of his brows. At this moment, he was akin to an Asura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All these years, Mu Chen had also experienced countless life and death battles, the killing intent in the depths of his bones was only stronger and not weaker than anyone in the Sacred Abyss Continent. It was just that he had been keeping it restrained most of the time, and the moment he unleashed it, it could send a chill down others spines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, those people were unhappy with Mu Chen blocking their view, but after sensing the killing intent coming from him, a chill went down their spines and they retracted their unrestrained gazes. They were all looking at Mu Chen in shock, since they never expected for such a young man to possess such killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is the recruitment zone, anyone that wants to hunt for members of the Fiend Clans in the Sacred Abyss Continent would usually go out in groups. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have many chances by themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So everyone that’s recruiting here all has a thing or two, and there’s no lack of Greater Earth Sovereigns…” Celestial Chi Yan explained as he walked towards the depths of the pavilion. There was a counter, along with a screen of Spiritual Energy that constantly flickered. Occasionally, there would be names trying to make it onto the Demon Slayer Plaque.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A grey-robed elder was lazily lying on the counter with a sleepy look, as if he couldn’t maintain being awake most of the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hand slammed on the counter and Celestial Chi Yan’s voice hollered, “Sleepy Old Goat, stop sleeping and start working!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alcoholic Old Goat, what are you yelling for! Aren’t you dead yet?” The grey-robed old man quivered and forcefully opened his eyes to look at Celestial Chi Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, even if I die, I will go after you.” Celestial Chi Yan impolitely responded before waving his hand towards Mu Chen and the rest. “Give the four of them a Demon Slayer Token.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that’s what this geezer is responsible for.” At the same time, he also introduced the old man to Mu Chen’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mu Chen and the rest heard him, their hearts trembled, since they never expected this unremarkable old man to be the one responsible for them. If Celestial Chi Yan did not tell them, they wouldn’t treat that old man as an ordinary receptionist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They swept their gazes at the old man with curiosity. However, there wasn’t any Spiritual Energy fluctuation from the old man. He looked like an ordinary person, but that was clearly impossible…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, to be able to retract his Spiritual Energy to the point of not having any leakage, it was something that only a Heavenly Sovereign could accomplish. Not even a Perfected Earth Sovereign could do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen and the rest exchanged gazes and their hearts trembled. No wonder Celestial Chi Yan said not to treat the Great Thousand Palace as a symbol, so their strength was also so terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man glanced at Mu Chen’s group before looking at Celestial Chi Yan with astonishment. “Old Goat, looks like you’re coming for the Ancient Spirit Channeling Light again? But all those candidates that you have chosen seemed to have failed so far.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Celestial Chi Yan’s face instantly turned dark. “You’re speaking as if someone else has succeeded!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grey-robed old man grinned. “I’m only curious about why you have chosen a Lesser Earth Sovereign lass.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, he had actually determined that Luo Li was the one chosen by Celestial Chi Yan, and not the other three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Celestial Chi Yan grinned. “Wanting to obtain the Ancient Spirit Channelling Light can’t just rely on strength. Regardless of strength or opportunity, this lass is the most suitable person that I have chosen by far.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” The grey-robed old man held doubts, but did not speak anymore. His hand waved and Mu Chen’s group felt a sting by their fingertips before four drops of blood flew out to the grey-robed old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen and the rest couldn’t help changing their faces as they looked at the grey-robed old man in shock. They felt that the latter was a little domineering from how he extracted their blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This grey-robed old man had utterly disregarded their Spiritual Energy defenses to control the blood in their bodies so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe.” The old man grinned as he flicked his finger. Four spiritual lusters flew out and enveloped the four drops of blood before condensing into four tokens before returning to Mu Chen’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they received the tokens, the tokens were black in color with two crimson names on them, Demon Slayer along with the words Low Rank at the bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you guys kill a Fiend Clan, just shatter a strand of their demonic souls and put it in the Demon Slayer Token to obtain the corresponding Demon Slayer Points. Furthermore, only you can check the Demon Slayer Points that were refined by your blood. So it’s useless, even if someone else took it.” The grey-robed old man explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fiddling with the Demon Slayer Token, the four of them cupped their hands towards the old man. “Thank you, Senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the four of them have obtained their Demon Slayer Tokens, Celestial Chi Yan said towards the old man, “Sleepy Old Goat, how many forces have come for the Sacred Abyss this time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his eyelids, the old man chuckled, “Isn’t that one of them? Let me look at who it is. They seem to be the members of the Northern Domain’s Wen Clan…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Celestial Chi Yuan turned over and saw a group entering the pavilion. There was a red-clothed old woman strolling on the side, causing Celestial Chi Yan’s eyes to narrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s actually Matron He from the Wen Clan…” Mu Chen, Luo Li, and the rest also raised their heads in curiosity. Those that entered possessed extraordinary bearings, and when their gazes passed that old woman, a slender silhouette suddenly entered their eyes.</span></p>
