As it dominated, even the space couldn’t bear that pressure and had gradually become distorted.</span></p>

When he saw that the latter had closed his eyes, the corner of his eyes lightly twitched as he eerily said, “Even at this point in time, you still dare to act. You’re truly courting death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, when the powerful will had caused intense pain to his mind, it had also given Lin Ming great confidence. Under this state, he was absolutely confident that he could suppress Mu Chen.</span></p>

Someone as cautious as him had told him that this battle couldn’t be delayed on any further. Mu Chen, who stood before him, wasn’t a simple opponent; and now, since he had the opportunity, he had to beat Mu Chen to the point that he didn’t even have any energy to stand up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As this thought flashed through his mind, Lin Ming’s gaze abruptly turned ferocious and his seals swiftly changed. Up above in the eyes of the massive black skull, there were crimson flames, which made it look alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Space undulated as the huge mouth of the black skull slowly opened up.</span></p>

At this sort of time, the only thing that they could do was to hope that Mu Chen still had cards up his sleeves.</span></p>

The current situation was completely grasped by Lin Ming, and if Mu Chen was out means, then it would be tough to shake the victory of this match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Lin Ming’s face slowly lifted into a vicious smile, before he abruptly joined his hands. His voice, which was filled with killing intent, resound, “Devil-Devouring Art - Devil-Devouring Death Light!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black light was extremely bizarre, without any fluctuations. It was deathly silent and in the depths of it, even the Spiritual Energy in this region was annihilated by it.</span></p>

If they were to be struck by this attack, even the Spiritual Energy in their bodies would be erased. This attack from Lin Ming was extremely overbearing and vicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing such an attack, how would Mu Chen fight?</span></p>

It was as fast as a bolt of lightning, making it impossible to dodge.</span></p>

His body had tensed up as well. If Mu Chen couldn’t resist Lin Ming, then he could only forcefully take action to save him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the deathly beam of light enveloped over, and when everyone thought that Mu Chen had given up resisting, the latter had suddenly opened his tightly shut eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lightning seemed to flash in his black pupils, which were as sharp as a hawk, as if he could nearly pierce through space.</span></p>

That’s because, as a Battle Formation Master herself, she was extremely familiar with the energy of will. Although it did not have a form, the eyes of a person could display the energy of will the most. Thus, the change in Mu Chen’s eyes had undoubtedly proven that his will had become extremely powerful in that instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that short period, when he had closed his eyes, his will had grown stronger!</span></p>

Regardless of anything, she and Mu Chen had once sincerely cooperated and knew some of each other’s secrets. Compared to vicious people like Lin Ming and Xiao Tian, Zhantai Liuli was clearly more willing to be friends with Mu Chen. Therefore, her heart had sided more towards Mu Chen, although it was an outcome in contrast to the one that the Divine Pavilion was anticipating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, when Mu Chen opened his eyes, the deathly black light had swept over and was reflected in his eyes, causing his eyes to be even more abstruse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Afterimages flew as his hands joined together.</span></p>

They seemed to have felt an abnormal energy beaconing them. Under the abnormal beacon, the Battle Will that surged from their bodies had instantly grown stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

As the storm of Battle Will whistled, everyone could see the appearance of a war banner.</span></p>

In that instant when the war banner appeared, the entire region had instantly darkened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable oppression was being emitted from the war banner.</span></p>

That’s because they had realised that there were over 16,000 runes on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was more than the black skull, which Lin Ming had formed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, Mu Chen had utilised a special technique at this moment to make his Battle Will stronger, thus he was able to refine more runes with a similar level of Battle Will!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Deceiving!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Ming saw this scene and felt the number of runes on Mu Chen’s war banner, he had squinted his eyes. But his first reaction was that Mu Chen was trying to put on a show to intimidate him. Furthermore, even if it was real, both sides would only be able to fight on the same level.
