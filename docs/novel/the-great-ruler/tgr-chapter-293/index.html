 <p><strong>Chapter 293 - Join Hands</strong></p>
 <p>In the huge crater, the Spiritual Energy was extremely dazzling as it looked like a Spiritual Energy ocean with many light figures floating within. Although they did not have any consciousness, from the huge amount that had gathered, the Spiritual Energy had already reached a frightening degree.</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Pawns here were terrifyingly huge in numbers. If they were replaced with humans of equal strength, there would be thousands of Heavenly Fusion Stage experts. If they were all added together, even those of the Heavenly Fusion Stage would be destroyed by them.</p>
 <p>But, fortunately, those Spiritual Pawns did not possess any consciousness. Otherwise, Mu Chen and his group would have had to run for their lives.</p>
 <p>“So many Spiritual Pawns!” An Ran and her group were dumbfounded as they looked at the scene before them. Shortly after, they couldn’t help looking at Mu Chen, “How are we going to act?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s brows were knitted together. Aside from the huge amount of Spiritual Pawns, there was also an existence in the depths that was comparable to Heavenly Transformation Stage, the Spiritual Knight. They were comparable to a small army.</p>
 <p>“Our numbers are small and I’m afraid that we won’t be able to take over this place.” Luo Li’s brows slightly knitted together. Even though the Spiritual Pawns here didn’t possess any consciousness, even if they only knew how to use simple attacks, if they combined together, it would still be extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>Not to mention that on their side, they only had five people, with her and Mu Chen being the strongest in the group. If they had to rely on the two of them to deal with this huge amount of Spiritual Pawns, as well as the Spiritual Knight that was hidden in the depths, this would undoubtedly be really exhausting for them.</p>
 <p>And it was, naturally, unwise for them to exhaust a huge amount of their strength.</p>
 <p>“Furthermore…” Luo Li’s pupils glanced around the surrounding mountains and lightly added, “We aren’t the only one that had our eyes on here.”</p>
 <p>She could vaguely sense some concealed auras. Clearly, they weren’t the only ones there. However, everyone that had noticed this place had the same thoughts as them, as they did not possess the ability to swallow this fat lamb.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded as he had also sensed some of the concealed undulated Spiritual Energies.</p>
 <p>His eyes flickered and glance towards the mountain. Shortly after, he lightly smiled as his robust voice echoed, “Everyone, why the need to hide? The amount of Spiritual Pawns here isn’t little and no individual party is capable of taking it all. Since that’s the case, why don’t we work together?”</p>
 <p>His voice resounded throughout the mountains. However, there weren’t any movements from those Spiritual Pawns that had gathered in large numbers. They did not have any consciousness to the point that they could not even be called lifeforms. At best, they could only be considered relatively condensed Spiritual Energies. Therefore, Mu Chen wasn’t afraid that he would alarm them.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen’s words sounded out, the mountains were quiet for few minutes before a gale of wind broke out. Several figures came out of their hiding places, one after another, and were floating in the sky. The amount wasn’t small, roughly a few dozen. They formed separate circles to clearly differentiate that they were from different groups.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen glanced pass those figures that were up in the sky as a trace of astonishment flashed through his eyes. He could clearly sense that those teams had Heavenly Transformation Stage figures amongst them. Although their strengths were only at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase, this could already prove their strengths.</p>
 <p>‘Indeed, worthy of being the Hunting War. The strength of many people has increased.’ Mu Chen sighed in his heart. Generally speaking, those with strength at the Heavenly Transformation Stage could compete with the top 20 of the Heavenly Ranking. But, clearly, in this Hunting War, the amount of Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase experts would have quite a huge change. Henceforth, the strength of a Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase expert would be far from sufficient to enter into the top 20 of the Heavenly Ranking.</p>
 <p>“My name is Mu Chen, I wonder how should I address everyone?” Mu Chen smiled as he cupped his hands towards the crowd.</p>
 <p>Hearing that name, many people glanced at Mu Chen with astonishment as this name wasn’t unfamiliar in the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>“Haha, so it was the famous Junior Apprentice Brother Mu Chen. I’ve long heard of your name, my name is Lin Feng.” A youth also smiled as he cupped his hands in return. He was the leader of an estimated ten-man group.</p>
 <p>“Liu Zhan.” Another youthful leader cupped his hands and declared.</p>
 <p>“Chen Peng.” A skinny youth also nodded as his face was filled with arrogance.</p>
 <p>Those three were the leaders of the three groups and their strengths were also the strongest amongst them with Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase strengths. No wonder those people that followed them had faith in them.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen lightly smiled, “I believe that everyone is clear that the amount of Spiritual Pawns gathered in this area is too much, to the point that no one could take them down by themselves. Why don’t we cooperate and work together. As for the distribution of Spiritual Light, it’d depend on our individual abilities, what do you say?”</p>
 <p>When the three leaders heard Mu Chen’s suggestion, their eyes flickered with light. Lin Feng and Liu Zhan didn’t have any objections, whereas Chen Peng glanced at Mu Chen from up high before shaking his head, “We are the ones who discovered this place first. You want us to split some of it to you guys the instant you get here? This isn’t such a good thing.”</p>
 <p>Among the three groups, Chen Peng’s group had the most people and was also the strongest in strength. They originally wanted to defeat the Spiritual Pawns that were here slowly, but who could have expected that this place would be found by two other groups. Henceforth, they hiddenly stood against the confrontation and, all of a sudden, Mu Chen suddenly appeared. Furthermore, from the looks of it, they also wanted to have a share of the Spiritual Pawns.</p>
 <p>Although Chen Peng had heard of Mu Chen before, he wasn’t too afraid of him. With his strength at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase, even in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, he could be considered as outstanding. Adding the formation behind him, he wasn’t too willing to split this cake with them.</p>
 <p>Hearing the contempt in his words, An Ran and her group was a little furious. But due to the power that the other party possessed, they did not dare to say anything.</p>
 <p>“Then, what does Brother Chen Peng want?” Mu Chen lightly smiled. No one could clearly see through the expression in his black pupils.</p>
 <p>“How about this. It wasn’t easy for you guys to get here. If you guys help us, when all of the Spiritual Pawns are eliminated, we’ll give you guys a hundred Spiritual Lights, what do you say?” said Chen Peng.</p>
 <p>“A hundred Spiritual Lights?” Mu Chen’s brows twitched. Shortly after, he laughed, “It seems that Brother Chen Peng believes that we do not possess the strength to split this cake.”</p>
 <p>Chen Peng did not comment and quietly circulated the Spiritual Energy within his body. Although he was arrogant, he was also cautious. Although this Mu Chen that stood before him only had strength at the Quasi-Heavenly Transformation Stage, it was said that not even those of the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase could do a thing to him. But after all, they were superior in terms of numbers. So if a fight were to break out, they could absolutely suppress the other team.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen lightly smiled as Luo Li stepped forth from his side.</p>
 <p>When Chen Peng saw Luo Li’s actions, his body tensed up. The dozens of people that stood behind him immediately turned cautious as they revealed considerable fighting experience and cooperation.</p>
 <p>“If you can withstand a sword from me, then we’ll become your cannon fodder for free.” Luo Li’s jade-like hands slightly tightened her grip on her sword hilt. Her pupils stared at Chen Peng as her voice was clear and calm.</p>
 <p>“What an arrogant tone of voice!” Chen Peng smiled from extreme anger.</p>
 <p>Rustle!</p>
 <p>However, before his smile stopped, Luo Li had already thrown a stab forth as a torrential sword aura shot out. It was like a brilliant ray of light as it instantly rip the horizon apart.</p>
 <p>A deep sword light burst forth ahead of Luo Li.</p>
 <p>When that sword aura shot out, Chen Peng’s face drastically changed. However, he still had some ability, after all, as he unleashed a bark with his Spiritual Energy bursting out from his body and rapidly turned into a Spiritual Energy light barrier before him.</p>
 <p>Shhhhh!</p>
 <p>Just when the Spiritual Energy light barrier took form, a brilliant sword aura shot against it, causing the light barrier to waver. Thereafter, it was torn apart under Chen Peng’s dumbstruck gaze.</p>
 <p>A streak of blood appeared on Chen Peng’s face and even several strands of his hair was severed. Making him appear to be in a sorry state.</p>
 <p>When the dozen of people behind Chen Peng saw that he could not even withstand a move, their faces drastically changed. Their gazes were filled with shock as they looked at Luo Li, who was sheathing her sword as she stood behind Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Even Lin Feng and Liu Zhan’s expressions were focused as they looked towards Luo Li with grave expressions. They never imagined that such a stunning lady would be so formidable.</p>
 <p>“Does any of you still have any opinions?” Mu Chen once again, directed his eyes towards Chen Peng, who was frightened. His voice was light, but within his black pupils, there was already chill light gathering within. If Chen Peng still refused to be tactful, then he would have to take some trouble to chase them away.</p>
 <p>Chen Peng lightly clenched his teeth. After all, he wasn’t an idiot. Although Mu Chen’s group was few in numbers, the strength that they showed was more than sufficient to keep them intimidated.</p>
 <p>“Okay.” He wasn’t an effeminate person. Since Mu Chen and his group possessed the sufficient strength to have a share of this cake, he would be seeking trouble if he continued to obstruct them.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Junior Apprentice Brother Mu Chen is, indeed, someone that even Li Xuantong could not do anything against.” Lin Feng laughed as he praised, “We have no opinions against your suggestion.”</p>
 <p>“So are we.” Liu Zhan nodded his head as well.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen lightly smiled. “Since that’s the case, then I hope that we’ll have a good time cooperating with each other.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s line-of-sight shifted towards the crater where the undulated Spiritual Energy was like the ocean. The sight of it raised a heat that flashed through his eyes. If they could dispose of all those Spiritual Pawns, then it would definitely be a huge harvest for them.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, get ready to start. Otherwise, the longer we drag this on, the more people will gather towards this location.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen laughed. Shortly after, the Spiritual Energy within his body surged out in waves as it soared into the clouds like black smoke.</p>
 <p>“Okay!”</p>
 <p>Lin Feng, Liu Zhan and Chen Peng acknowledged as they circulated the Spiritual Energies within them and their Majestic Spiritual Energies instantly fluctuated, filling the void between the heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>Just when Mu Chen and the rest were getting ready to destroy this gathering point, there were several concealed gazes that were fixed onto them somewhere in the depths of the mountain range.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Big Brother, they’re about to start, are we still just going to observe them?” The voice sounded like a laughter.</p>
 <p>“Lin Feng and the rest are just trivial matters. However, the two freshmen, Mu Chen and Luo Li are a little thorny. But no worries, the three of us have concealed ourselves for so long, and now, it’s time to reveal our strengths. After this Hunting War, there will definitely be a spot for us in the top 10 of the Heavenly Ranking.” Another voice sounded out, it was also a faint laughter.</p>
 <p>Up ahead of them was a slender figure and his gaze was indifferently looking towards the crater’s direction. His faint voice was ice-cold with mockery.</p>
 <p>“Let them deal with those Spiritual Pawns and, at that time, all we have to do is conclude it, as well as leave a hundred Spiritual Lights to express our gratitude.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, Big Brother is so generous.”</p>
