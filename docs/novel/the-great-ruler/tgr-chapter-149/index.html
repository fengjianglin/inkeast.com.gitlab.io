 <p><b>Chapter 149 – Black Flames</b></p>
 <p><span style>As black flames emerged from the depths of Mu Chen’s eyes, his eyes turned slightly weird. Dark black Spiritual Energy also wrapped around his body. As the Spiritual Energy surged around him, hints of black flames also moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen immediately stepped into the sky and slowly gripped his hands. A mysterious fluctuation also emitted from his body. At this moment, dark black Spiritual Energy also gathered behind his body. However, it did not form the shape of the ingested Soul Essence like Shi Jingtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because he did not ingest a Spiritual Beast’s Soul Essence. What he was performing instead was the much higher ranked method; Bloodline Bond. At this moment, he currently possessed some of the Nine Netherbird’s abilities. Moreover, this ability was much more flexible. This is due to the Bloodline Bond. The Nine Netherbird within his body possessed a complete intelligence. Therefore, compared to the Spiritual Beast’s Soul Essence where Shi Jingtian had completely erased its consciousness, it had more spirituality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless gazes gathered on Mu Chen’s body. They could detect that the Spiritual Energy fluctuations emitting from his &nbsp;body had increased considerably &nbsp;as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy become that much stronger all of a sudden? It’s even stronger than a Spirit Stage Late Phase. Could it be because he ingested a Spiritual Beast’s Soul Essence?” Ye Qingling said in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Li’s eyes focused as she stared at Mu Chen’s body. A hint of surprise also flashed through her clear eyes. Perhaps others might fail to detect it, but she could tell how domineering the dark black Spiritual Energy that wrapped around Mu Chen’s body was. Moreover, it secretly gave off a heart-throbbing feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A powerful Spiritual Beast is probably within his body. However, it isn’t the Mysterious Spirithail Dragon and the Geocentric Flame Jalapura.” Luo Li muttered to herself. A faint smile immediately emerged on her face. She knew that he would be able to catch up even if he had lost the opportunity from the Spiritual Road. There were even times when Luo Li had believed in Mu Chen more than she believed in herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is because they had encountered numerous difficulties and dangers during their one year within the Spiritual Road. In the end, it was always the smiling boy who had helped her escape these dangers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Luo Li usually did not show much concern for anything, she was actually quite prideful deep down inside. However, this pride of hers was constantly destroyed ever since she met Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the half-year chase, she actually knew that Mu Chen had countless opportunities to kill her. However, he still gave up in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, Luo Li felt that he was truly foolish for giving up these opportunities. But until she finally managed to defeat him and placed her sword in front of Mu Chen’s throat, she finally understood that she wasn’t able to kill him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This boy &nbsp;was like a spider who would form spider webs within spider webs. On the other hand, she was a tiny chick that chased after him endlessly. But once she finally came to her senses, she discovered that the layers of spider silk had already wrapped around her tightly. She had been trapped to the extent that she did not even wish to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen was, indeed, still powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Li’s glass-like eyes twinkled as she stared at the thin figure. Then, she smiled softly. In that instant, numerous people’s gazes were captivated by that smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder you dared to show up, so you were hiding your abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Jingtian also noticed the Mu Chen’s mysterious Spiritual Energy fluctuations, which had increased in strength &nbsp;in an instant, and his eyes turned serious. He immediately let out a cold laugh. Since he had suffered earlier, he was quite vigilant towards Mu Chen. However, he had currently summoned the Earthstone Spirit Python and his strength was infinitely close to a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse. On the other hand, Mu Chen’s power up had only caused his strength to be equivalent to a Spirit Stage Late Phase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gap between them had opened up instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me show you just who is the one getting carried away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingtian clenched his hands and dense Spiritual Energy surged out like a flood. Angry roars rang out from his throat as a mysterious fluctuation spread out underneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the earth seemed to tremble. As he stomped down and charged into the sky, greyish-white Spiritual Aura erupted out from his clasped hands. It actually formed into numerous greyish-white lights. These lights soon formed into numerous boulders that were suspended in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An overbearing fluctuation was emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, many individuals’ gazes turned solemn. They could detect that every single one of the rocks formed near Shi Jingtian had the power to gravely injure a Spirit Stage powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was evident that his combat abilities had soared after activating the Soul Essence’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone Emperor Art, Meteorite Shower!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Jingtian’s eyes darkened as he locked down on Mu Chen, who was below him. His gaze instantly turned cold as he changed the seals formed by his hands. At this moment, the numerous greyish-white lights suddenly buzzed and sounds of the winds breaking instantly rang out. These countless rocks descended down towards Mu Chen and covered almost all of his paths of retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen lifted his head and stared at the rocks that were rapidly becoming larger within his eyes. At this moment, he took a deep breath and circulated the Great Pagoda Art within his body. A mysterious light started to flash within the depths of his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dark black Spiritual Energy that was surging on the surface of his body instantly turned into a blurry black light tower. On top of the light tower, traces of black flames floated around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the black light tower was formed, the descending rocks came violently crashing down. In the end, they had smashed fiercely onto the black light tower outside of Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth seemed to tremble at this moment. Countless people stared in shock at the earth where the bombardment of rocks occurred. At that location, smoke spread out and covered their line of sight. However, they were still able to feel how terrifying the attack was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This vicious attack would definitely turn anyone who was at the Spirit Stage Late Phase into pulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye Qingling and the others were staring nervously at the place where the smoke rose up. Their hands were clenched tightly. Sun’Er even had to cover her eyes with her tiny hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only one that remained calm was Luo Li. Although Shi Jingtian’s attack was indeed powerful, it clearly wasn’t enough to kill Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the bombardment ended. The smoke also started to disperse and everybody immediately turned their attention to that location. Then, sounds of gasps rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the place where the ground was collapsing, a person was quietly suspended in midair. On top of his body, the blurry black light tower had remained completely motionless in the face of Shi Jingtian’s attack. That amazing offensive performed by Shi Jingtian had actually caused no damage to him at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is this possible?!” In the sky, Shi Jingtian was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he was horrified, Mu Chen’s body had appeared in front of him like a phantom. Winds formed by his fists rushed out while it was being wrapped by dark black Spiritual Energy. It drew an arc as it pounded heavily against Shi Jingtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Jingtian hurriedly summoned his Spiritual Energy and blocked with his rock-like arms. The Stone Emperor Art that he had trained in allowed him to possess powerful defence as well. Therefore, he wasn’t afraid of a hand-to-hand fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong! Dong! Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Mu Chen didn’t seem to be concerned about it. His fists were wrapped in dark black Spiritual Energy and bombarded against Shi Jingtian’s arms. At this moment, Shi Jingtian’s expression changed drastically. This is because he detected that extreme heat was being transferred into his arm every time Mu Chen’s fists landed. This intense heat would charge into his meridians, which caused severe pain in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something’s strange with this guy’s Spiritual Energy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Jingtian was shocked. Only now did he detect that there was a hint of black flames that was within the dark black Spiritual Energy whenever Mu Chen attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must not fight against him head on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Jingtian hurriedly retreated backwards. The black flame was too overbearing. If he let too much of the black flames seep into his body, it would probably scorch his meridians, which would gravely injure him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must not delay this battle.” Shi Jingtian finally felt a bit of unease. Mu Chen’s strange techniques had finally made him quite uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll deal with him in one attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Viciousness filled Shi Jingtian’s eyes. He immediately gritted his teeth as his arms trembled slightly. The greyish-white color in his arms turned increasingly dark. His large veins also twitched. At this moment, even his ten fingers seemed to be crafted from stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanied with the greyish-white light, a formidable fluctuation erupted from Shi Jingtian’s palms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the greyish-white light and Spiritual Energy had reached its peak, Shi Jingtian shouted loudly as he smacked down with his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly Stonesmash Palm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following Shi Jingtian’s shout, a greyish-white light escaped his hand and instantly formed into a massive stone palm. This palm was covered with rock engravings and was extremely tough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Mu Chen’s palm also released out a dark black light. He, too, fired out a palm attack calmly. In that instant, faint sounds of thunders were formed and the entire sky seemed to darken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vajra Pagoda!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen also struck with his palm. The dark black Spiritual Energy formed into a black palm. On the black palm, dark golden tower engravings emerged and a fluctuation that seemed to suppress everything appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two palm attacks ripped through the air and collided heavily with each other like meteorites. At that moment, a loud noise resounded. Violent shockwaves were emitted and formed gales in the area. Sand and stone were instantly swept up from the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Suppress!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s eyes turned cold and he clenched his hands. Underneath the golden tower engravings, Shi Jingtian was aghast to see that his rock palm was beginning to crack. It was as if the Spiritual Energy within it was completely erased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is this possible?!” Shi Jingtian was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Mu Chen ignored him and the black palm with golden tower engravings completely emerged above Shi Jingtian as it smacked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Shi Jingtian hurriedly circulated his Spiritual Energy to protect this body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the palm still beat down mercilessly at him. After a muffled cry, everybody noticed Shi Jingtian falling down from the sky and landed fiercely on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground instantly shattered and web-like cracks spread out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puchi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Jingtian had a pale expression as he spat out a mouthful of blood. Traces of horror were still shown in his eyes. He never imagined that the attacks of Mu Chen would be so terrifying. Not even he, who was infinitely close to a Heavenly Fusion Stage, could block it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes blinked as he attempted to retreat backwards. However, he heard the sounds of winds breaking and a light with black flames rushed across his eyes. Then, Mu Chen’s slender fingers, which carried black flames, stopped in front of his throat like the black scythe of a death god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His body instantly froze and was covered with cold sweat. He did not dare make even the slightest movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve told you before…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s black eyes stared calmly at Shi Jingtian, who was completely horrified, as he slowly spoke: “If you get carried away, you will have to pay a price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, you should hand over this price. Otherwise, I do not mind eliminating you.”</span></p>
