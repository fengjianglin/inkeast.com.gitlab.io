 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every gaze in this region was directed towards the direction that Mu Chen had pointed at with his hand and saw a beautiful silhouette amongst the factions of the Divine Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That silhouette was naturally Zhantai Liuli, who had once joined forces with Mu Chen in the Death Ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the panicking experts of the Divine Pavilion, Zhantai Liuli’s strength wasn’t too outstanding. Thus, when everyone saw her, there was a smear of astonishment in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because they had realised that right from the start, Zhantai Liuli had maintained a calm expression. Despite seeing the death of the Divine Pavilion Master, there wasn’t any panic on her face. It was so much so that if one took a clear look at her, they would notice a lift on the corner of her lips, making her look a little happy…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the surrounding experts of the Divine Pavilion that had dull gazes, it was a clear contrast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when Zhantai Liuli, who had maintained a calm visage, saw that Mu Chen had pointed over at her direction, a smear of astonishment flashed in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, she had not expected Mu Chen to provide help to her at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Her?”</span></p>

Despite the cultivation of the latter being extremely ordinary to the point that she was even pulling down the experts of the Divine Pavilion, Mandala had sensed a peculiar fluctuation coming from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The power of Battle Will?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She’s</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;a Battle Formation Master?” Mandala’s brows lifted. Battle Formation Masters were extremely rare in the Northern Region, so judging from the current situation, that girl did have the qualifications to be incorporated by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t belittle her. If it wasn’t for her help at the rock island, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain that Perfect Spiritual Divine Liquid,” said Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words weren’t wrong. Perhaps everyone would think that without her troops, Zhantai Liuli was no different from a useless person. But he was clear that back then, in the Death Ruin, Zhantai Liuli had also obtained the other half of the Divine Battle Will Board. If that item had been activated, she would have been able to even confront Eighth Grade Sovereigns. So if Zhantai Liuli had brought out her Divine Battle Will Board back then, then it would’ve been impossible for Mu Chen to seize that ancient dolium and he would have also landed in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the reason why Zhantai Liuli did not use it was because of her grudges with the Divine Pavilion. So she wasn’t willing to see the Divine Pavilion Master to break through. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to take her revenge during her lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala heard Mu Chen’s words, she was slightly startled. It was so much so that her gaze had turned gentle when she looked at Zhantai Liuli. Although she wasn’t clear about the inside information, since Mu Chen had already spoken out, then that would mean that even their Great Havenlaw Domain had owed that girl a favour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since that’s the case, then our Great Havenlaw Domain is considered to have owed her a favour. So our Great Havenlaw Domain will naturally protect her.” Mandala smiled towards Zhantai Liuli as she continued, “As long as she is willing, the doors of our Great Havenlaw Domain will always be opened for her and the Eleventh King of the Great Havenlaw Domain will also belong to her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, the recruitment intention behind her words was extremely evident and the surrounding forces had slight changes in their expressions. After all, they were clear about the potential of a Battle Formation Master. So, even if they were more courageous, they wouldn’t dare to try and snatch her from the Great Havenlaw Domain. Thus, they could only shake their heads in pity at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli was stunned, but hesitation appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Zhantai, you are worried about the danger to your family. After this is all done, our Great Havenlaw Domain will send someone to the Divine Pavilion to receive your family. I can make my guarantee right here that your family will be fine.” When Mu Chen saw the hesitation on Zhantai Liuli’s face, he had instantly spoken out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s guarantee, Zhantai Liuli clenched her teeth as she nodded her head. “If you can save my family, I will definitely work for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhantai Liuli!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You traitor, our Divine Pavilion has done so much to nurture you, to help you become a Battle Formation Master and you actually dared to betray us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the experts of the Divine Pavilion in the surroundings saw this scene, they immediately roared with anger. Especially the Four Pavilion Lords, all of them had looked at Zhantai Liuli with vicious gazes. If it wasn’t for their movements being sealed by Mandala, they might have already made a move to kill her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing their enraged roars, the corner of Zhantai Liuli’s mouth lifted into a mocking arc as she coldly said, “Nurture? Your Divine Pavilion saw my talent in Battle Will back then and sent someone to slaughter my clan, forcing me to submit to your Divine Pavilion. However, you guys were still not rested assured and even poisoned my little sister into being a cripple in an attempt to force my loyalty to your Divine Pavilion. Haha, I have always remembered this ‘nurturing’ of yours. But the heavens have not let me down. Today is the day your Divine Pavilion pays back the price!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli’s voice was filled with a cold and dense viciousness. Now that the Divine Pavilion couldn’t even protect themselves, she had finally let go of the hatred in her heart and had nothing to worry about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Zhantai Liuli’s cold and vicious words, the Four Pavilion Lords were speechless, and could only viciously look at Zhantai Liuli. Before they could even speak, they saw Mandala wave her hand and a terrifying Spiritual Energy pressure spread out, immediately causing the Four Pavilion Lords to groan as traces of blood leaked from the corner of their lips. Instantly, they were frightened to the point that they no longer dared to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Congratulations to the Great Havenlaw Domain for obtaining a powerful general.” When the Myriad Saint Ancestor saw this scene, he smiled with his eyes narrowed as he said. Clearly, judging from his tone, the intentions to pull their relation closer was evident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala did not have any grudges with the Myriad Saint Ancestor, so she replied with a smile, before directing her gaze towards the remaining Earth Sovereigns. “Since the Divine Pavilion Master has fallen, then there’s no need for the Divine Pavilion to remain. I wonder, what are all your opinions about the territories of the Divine Pavilion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she asked that, the other Earth Sovereigns had their eyes squinted. The Divine Pavilion was, after all, the most powerful peak force in the Northern Region, with ample territory and a deep foundation. It was definitely a huge pie and as long as they could have a slice of it, it would definitely be a great improvement to their own forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, the territories of the peak forces did not have specific rules. Basically, whose fist was greater would get the most. So in the past Hunting Wars, it had always been the Divine Pavilion that got the biggest pie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that was the past, since the current situation was clearly different. The power of the Great Havenlaw Domain had already exceeded the other peak forces. So if the other Earth Sovereigns had thought that if Mandala was still willing to take out the pie to share, then they would be too naïve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Earth Sovereigns all exchanged a glance, but it was the Myriad Saint Ancestor that spoke out in the end. “I wonder if the Great Havenlaw Ruler has any thoughts about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala saw their attitudes, she lightly smiled and said without being the slightest bit polite, “My Great Havenlaw Domain will occupy half of the Divine Pavilion’s treasury and territories.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mandala’s demand, the faces of the Myriad Saint Ancestor and the rest changed. If that’s the case, then the other forces could only split up the other half of the Divine Pavilion? If that’s the case, then they might not even be able to obtain one-tenth of it at the end…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Nine Nether had also inwardly smacked their lips. Half of the Divine Pavilion’s treasury probably wouldn’t be less than ten million drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. This was definitely an extremely high income that could fatten the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, half of the Divine Pavilion’s territories was even greater than the Great Havenlaw Domain’s current territories. If they were to devour that amount of territories, the Great Havenlaw Domain would definitely become the most powerful force in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Havenlaw Ruler, aren’t you demanding a little too much?” The Netherworld Palace Master frowned his brows as he solemnly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, perhaps you need me to remind you guys the rules of the Northern Region?” However, when Mandala saw the questioning gaze of the other Earth Sovereigns, she wasn’t bothered by them and indifferently said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Northern Region, the winner takes all, and thus, the pie they would get would naturally be bigger as well. In the past, the other peak forces had used this as a standard. And now that the Great Havenlaw Domain had replaced the Divine Pavilion as the most powerful force in the Northern Region, they were naturally qualified to get the biggest share of the pie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the five Earth Sovereigns heard her words, they sunk in silence, except for the unwillingness in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone doesn’t have to be so anxious, I still have something to discuss with you all.” When Mandala saw the five Earth Sovereigns remaining silent, she smiled and spoke out once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala lifted her eyelids as she said, “I plan to form an alliance with all of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An alliance?” The five Earth Sovereigns had a change of their expressions and they couldn’t help sneering, “What? Could it be that the Great Havenlaw Ruler wishes to be like the Divine Pavilion Master and dominate the Northern Region?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala curled her lips in contempt as she answered, “I’m not so bored as to do that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the five Earth Sovereigns heard her words, they felt inwardly relieved. If Mandala was intending to act as the Divine Pavilion Master, then their Northern Region would definitely undulate to the point that even as peak forces themselves, they weren’t confident to get through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala flicked her finger and summoned the Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid, then she faintly said, “You guys should know that this Starlight Demon Suppression Pyramid can sense the location of the Ancient Haven Palace…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I believe you guys are aware that if the ruins of the Ancient Haven Palace appears, it will definitely shake the heavens and earth. At that time, I’m afraid that all the peak forces in the Skylaw Continent will come for it and my Great Havenlaw Domain is still not confident enough to eat this entire cake…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala spoke out, the hearts of the five Earth Sovereigns jolted and their eyes blossomed. Their eyes were blazing as they looked at Mandala.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala gently smiled. “So I want to form an alliance with all of you. If I manage to find the ruins of the Ancient Haven Palace, we can our join forces together. This way, we will have a share in the harvest of the Ancient Haven Palace…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder, what do you guys think of my suggestion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala finished her last word, the eyes of the Earth Sovereigns had turned much redder as they looked at Mandala. They said with slight disbelief, “You will still allow us to have a share in it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How great of an opportunity was the Ancient Haven Palace? It was something that ordinary Earth Sovereigns were unfated with, but right now, Mandala was actually willing to share it with them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although it’s a good opportunity, we have to know our limits. My Great Havenlaw Domain is still not powerful enough to devour the ruins of the Ancient Haven Palace.” Mandala smiled. Their Northern Region was only a part of the Skylaw Continent and just their Great Havenlaw Domain alone wasn’t qualified to fight the top forces in the Skylaw Continent. Therefore, she had to pull together the peak forces of the Northern Region; this way, they would be able to confront the peak forces of the Skylaw Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it? I wonder if you guys are interested in my suggestion?” Mandala said once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Earth Sovereigns heard her words, they exchanged a glance and clenched their teeth, then said without any hesitation, “As long as the Great Havenlaw Ruler is willing to let us have a share in it, we are definitely willing to help!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mandala heard their words, she gently smiled and nodded her head with satisfaction. “Since that’s the case, then this matter is settled… Furthermore, about the dividing of the Divine Pavilion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will listen to the Great Havenlaw Ruler!” The Earth Sovereigns decisively said without any unwillingness. Compared to the ruins of the Ancient Haven Palace, the Divine Pavilion was nothing worth mentioning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, thanks for that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the back, when Mu Chen saw how they discussed the fate of the Divine Pavilion, he was a little speechless. He had finally witnessed the authority of the Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouses. Even the powerful Divine Pavilion was nothing but a fat sheep without the Divine Pavilion Master. Instantly being divided, this cruelty made him slightly sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Mu Chen’s heart gradually turned cold, since the difference in strength was too great. There’s still a long way for him to go, but he still believed that one day, he would possess that sort of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s just that he still needed time for it to be fulfilled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head as he puffed out some white mist. No matter what, this Hunting War had finally come to an end. What made them feel fortunate was the fact that after this Hunting War, their Great Havenlaw Domain still managed to stand towering in the Northern Region!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And in the future, they would also keep growing stronger!</span></p>
