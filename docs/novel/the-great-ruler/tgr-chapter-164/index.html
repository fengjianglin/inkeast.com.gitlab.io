 <p><b>Chapter 164 – I will Control the Heaven and Earth</b></p>
 <p><span style>A mysterious feeling rippled through Mu Chen’s heart. Surprise instantly emerged on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had once felt this feeling when his Great Pagoda Art broke through to the Shape-Condensation level. Originally, Mu Chen had thought that the next time this feeling &nbsp;appeared would only be after he had at least reached the Heavenly Fusion Stage. He never imagined that it would actually come so early.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it because of the power of the divine lightning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen pondered thoughtfully. The divine lightning had a miraculous effect, strengthening Spiritual Energy. After training for a few days, Mu Chen could feel the subtle changes in the Spiritual Energy within his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the feeling of it being more condensed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen suppressed the delight he had within his heart. After all, the mysterious feeling was only a sign before the Great Pagoda Art makes a breakthrough. It wasn’t a true breakthrough yet. Next up, he must grasp this mysterious feeling and successfully advance to the next level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, his Great Pagoda Art had reached the Shape-Condensation level. If he was able to progress further, he would reach the Towerform level. Only by reaching this point, he would be considered to have successfully trained in the Great Pagoda Art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towards the mysterious Spiritual Art that his mother left for him, Mu Chen had always been curious about it. According to Mu Feng, the mysterious Spiritual Pulse within his body was sealed by his mother. If he wanted to release the seal, the Great Pagoda Art was the key.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, in Mu Chen’s opinion, the breakthrough in the Great Pagoda Art was more important than his breakthrough to the Spirit Stage Late Phase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen sat cross-legged on the lightning platform and began activating the Great Pagoda Art once again. In an instant, a dark golden light was emitted and the originally dissipating thunderclouds gathered once again. Endless amounts of lightning being to descend from the thunderclouds and struck Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chi Chi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dazzling lightning spread across the surface of Mu Chen’s body as he circulated the Great Pagoda Art at full strength. He forced the dark black Spiritual Energy to surge through his meridians rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Mu Chen circulated the Great Pagoda Art at full strength, he was able to detect that dark mysterious lights had slowly appeared within the depths of his body…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the mysterious lights would fade and reappear. However, once the divine lightning struck Mu Chen’s body, these lights would suddenly brighten up a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, it is because of the power of the divine lightning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aware of this scene, Mu Chen finally understood the reason behind the breakthrough in the Great Pagoda Art. He immediately opened his eyes and stood up. He stared into the depths as he muttered: “The efficiency of the divine lightning on the third level is still too low. If this continues, I’m afraid that the mysterious feeling would gradually subside and I will lose this opportunity of advancing my Great Pagoda Art.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of breakthrough was mostly due to luck. Once he fails, he could only wait for the next opportunity to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s eyes flashed and he decisively took action. His body moved as he rushed swiftly to the depths of the third level of the Lightning Territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In less than ten minutes, Mu Chen had reached the depths of the third level. There, a distortion appeared once again. Outside of the distortion, there was a faint light barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to enter the fourth level of the Lightning Territory, one must possess the strength of a Heavenly Fusion Stage. This light barrier was left here to stop students beneath this level from entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen completely ignored the light barrier and charged directly into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, numerous figures stared at the light barrier. Almost all of them possess the strength of a Heavenly Fusion Stage. It was evident that they were considered excellent within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. At this moment, they were somewhat startled when they noticed Mu Chen’s figure. Just where did this brat come from? Did he not know that only people who had the strength of a Heavenly Fusion Stage were eligible to enter the fourth level?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few of them chuckled and grinned. Every one of them was quite interested in this. After all, they knew how powerful the light barrier was. Even if it would not hurt the student that attempted to forcibly pass through, it would at least cause the student to be in an awkward situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Mu Chen did not care about the nearby gazes. When he was about to make contact with the light barrier, he gripped his hand tightly and blasted out a punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four dark light seals emerged suddenly on Mu Chen’s fist. Then, it formed into a beam of black light as it bombarded fiercely against the light barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous ripples emitted from Mu Chen’s fists. Then, it became more and more violent. In the next instant, subtle cracking sounds rang out. The light barrier in front of Mu Chen had actually been forcibly destroyed by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the cracks appeared, Mu Chen rapidly entered. At this moment, there were many surprised gazes. Just when was it possible for a Spirit Stage Late Phase to enter the fourth level?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just where did that guy come from? Just by relying on his Spirit Stage Late Phase strength, he was able to unleash an attack that was comparable to a Heavenly Fusion Stage Initial Phase. That guy is pretty powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd that had been watching Mu Chen was completely shocked. However, they soon recovered and exclaimed loudly. Then, they stormed towards the fourth level of the Lightning Territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But when they charged into the fourth level of the Lightning Territory, Mu Chen’s figure had already disappeared. After Mu Chen quickly reached the fourth level, he could feel the difference between the third level and the fourth level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thunderclouds in the skies had already become pitch-black. Although the lightning strikes were less frequent than on the third level, deep rumbling sounds would resound occasionally. Just by this sound, one could tell how powerful the divine lightning was within this level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Mu Chen reached the fourth level, he immediately searched for an empty lightning platform. He quickly descended and sat cross-legged as he activated the lightning platform.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Mu Chen activated the lightning platform, the thunderclouds above his head began to gather. Just from their appearance, the thunderclouds were like a terrifying gigantic face. It revealed a wicked smile before a loud rumbling sound rang out. A lightning strike that was dozens of meters wide descended like a beam of light. In the next instant, it fiercely struck Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The powerful impact made Mu Chen’s body tremble fiercely. An intense pain emitted from the surface of his body. Mu Chen could feel that the divine lightning on the fourth level was powerful to the extent that it wasn’t the same grade as the third level. No wonder the academy would only allow students who had reached the Heavenly Fusion Stage to enter this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s body flashed as the lightning struck him. Then, he felt a dense amount of divine lightning entering his body. The power of the divine lightning from this one lightning strike was almost the same as ten strikes of lightning from the third level!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen was quite satisfied with the lightning on the fourth level and began to concentrate. As large amounts of divine lightning entered his body, he could feel that the mysterious black lights within his body began to become brighter at a slow pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the pace was quite slow, it was still many times faster than earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen concentrated and gradually adapted to the divine lightning on the fourth level. Afterwards, he began to increase the frequency of the lightning strikes. Later on, the thunderclouds above his head became increasingly violent and numerous divine lightning bolts struck down. These rampaging lightning strikes had shocked the nearby students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be able to fearlessly activate the lightning platform to this level of frequency, it was not something that an ordinary Heavenly Fusion Stage Initial Phase student would do. They neither had the courage or the ability to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the divine lightning continued to bombard downwards, Mu Chen seemed to have completely secluded himself from the outside world and was only concerned about the changes within his body. This sort of selfless training had quickly lasted for ten days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During these ten days, Mu Chen’s body had basically remained motionless. The descent of lightning strikes from the thunderclouds had also never stopped. It had become an extremely eye-catching scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous students that were cultivating had felt surprised and cast their gazes to this place. On the dark golden lightning platform, they were able to vaguely see a slender figure sitting cross-legged amongst the raging lightning strikes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the fourth level of the Lightning Territory, it was extremely rare to see such a scene. For ten full days, divine lightning had been summoned endlessly. Even a person who had reached the Heavenly Fusion Stage Middle Phase wouldn’t be able to endure it, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just who exactly is this guy? How is he this powerful…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not far away, there were numerous figures standing on a lightning platform. Every single one of them was somewhat surprised as they watched this scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of these individuals, there was a familiar face. It was the face of a cool beauty who was wearing a red dress. It was An Ran, who had lost to Mu Chen within the Northern Heavens World.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That guy is truly powerful. Even I wouldn’t be able to endure this level of divine lightning. I really want to know just who this powerful person is…” Beside An Ran, a youth chuckled. However, he could not conceal the surprise on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are a lot of students within our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Who knows how many people were hiding their strength and cultivated secretly as they waited for the day to suddenly shock everyone? Perhaps this person was one of them.” Another youth laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When An Ran heard their words, her beautiful eyes also stared at the lightning. The figure gave her a somewhat familiar feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just who is that person?” An Ran frowned as she muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? The lightning seems to be weakening.” All of a sudden, the youth beside An Ran spoke out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An Ran immediately turned her gaze over. As expected, the originally violent lightning had begun to weaken. The commotion caused by that place had been extremely eye-catching for the past few days. Therefore, many people immediately cast their gazes over in surprise and curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As countless gazes focused on Mu Chen’s body, Mu Chen’s focus remained within his body. In the depths of his body, the originally looming, mysterious black lights had suddenly become quite bright. A mysterious fluctuation quietly emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Mu Chen felt the mysterious black lights tremble. Then, he noticed that the black lights extended and formed a beam of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These beams of lights would extend out and connect with every single one of the black lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Chen watched this occur, his heart tensed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shortly after, the black light beams finally completely connected with each other. And in the moment when they finished linking up, Mu Chen’s heart jumped. This is because, he noticed that lights spread out and the black lights had slowly formed into a mysterious black tower within his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the instant that the mysterious black tower was formed, Mu Chen felt that he had travelled through time and space. An obscure and mysterious ancient voice echoed slowly within his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By turning the body to a Pagoda, I will control the heavens and the earth."</span></p>
