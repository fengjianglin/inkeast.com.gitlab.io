 <p><b>Chapter 101 - Heavenly Fusion Stage</b></p>
 <p><span style>The entire temple was enshrouded by an amazing Spiritual Energy pressure. Underneath this pressure, everybody’s face changed, and they stared in horror at the grey-robed old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a Spiritual Energy pressure that surpassed a Spirit Stage powerhouse. It could only have been coming from someone who stepped into the first stage of the Three Heavens Stage, the Heavenly Fusion Stage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The so-called Three Heavens Stage was not a single stage. Rather it referred to three separate levels. The first level was known as the Heavenly Fusion Stage, the second level was known as the Heavenly Transform Stage, and the third level was the Heavenly Completion Stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, the Spiritual Energy Pressure emitted from the grey-robed old man was something that only a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse would possess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Fusion Stage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody within the temple felt their mouth stiffen. How many years had it been since a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse appeared in the Northern Spiritual Realm? A powerhouse of this level would be considered as a genuine powerhouse even within the Hundred Spirit Heavens, not to mention within the Northern Spiritual Realm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no less than 10 Spirit Stage powerhouses present at the scene. However, even with this number, they were completely powerless in front of a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is because the gap between them was just too big.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as its name suggested, the Heavenly Fusion Stage was able to integrate with the world and manipulate a portion of the Spiritual Aura within the world. The power from simply their gestures could destroy a mountain. It was not something that an ordinary Spirit Stage powerhouse could compare with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s Liu Jingshan, the previous Territory Lord of the Liu Territory, and once the strongest person within the Northern Spiritual Realm. So he was actually still alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the temple, numerous gazes met with a bit of dismay. They could feel a bit of unease. The Northern Spiritual Realm could only maintain the current setup because a few forces had a relatively similar strength. Nobody was able to make another submit to them completely. Therefore, the Northern Spiritual Realm, because of this, had remained peaceful for so many years. However, Liu Jingshan, who had suddenly appeared, instantly broke the balance between the forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse would instantly increase the Liu Territory’s strength &nbsp;to an exponentially terrifying extent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Feng’s gaze fixated itself onto Liu Jingshan as he clenched his fists. Beside him, Mu Chen’s face turned serious. It seemed that the news they obtained was true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Mu Chen turned around to look at the other Territory Lords. He discovered that their expressions were exceptionally ugly. Hint of fear emerged in their eyes, when they stared at Liu Jingshan. This reaction made Mu Chen sigh. If the 8 territories were to join forces, they wouldn’t be particularly afraid of Liu Jingshan. But unfortunately, none of them had the courage to fight against a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the temple, a few individuals could not breathe due to the atmosphere. As he slowly walked in, Liu Jingshan glanced at everybody. Seeing this, Liu Qingtian hurriedly handed over his seat. However, Liu Jingshan waved his hand. His eyes stared at the crowd as he said faintly: “It’s been a while since we’ve met with each other. I wonder if you still remember this old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohoho, Senior Liu was the strongest person within the Northern Spiritual Realm back in the days. Although you’d disappeared for 3 years, your prestige still remained. How could we forget you?” Tang Shan let out a dry cough and spoke with an unnatural, forced smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan smiled faintly and muttered, “Since everybody remembers me, you should know my personality as well. I have endured this ‘scattered setup’ within the Northern Spiritual Realm for many years. Now it’s time to resolve it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, everybody’s face changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Liu. We do not have much ambition within the Northern Spiritual Realm and do not wish to fight against the other large realms within the Hundred Spirit Heavens. Ohoho, isn’t it quite nice right now,” A Territory Lord asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan glanced at him and answered, “Although you do not have much ambition, I do… From today onwards, the Liu Territory will form the Northern Spiritual Alliance, and I will bear the responsibilities of being the chieftain. As for the rest of you, it is voluntary whether you decide to join or not. However, &nbsp;although I said that, there are only allies and enemies within my eyes. If you’re not willing to be my allies, then I can only treat you as my enemies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous faces inside the temple froze. Implied in Liu Jingshan’s words was an obvious threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingtian and the others smiled as they stared at everybody’s changing complexion. With a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse, the Liu Territory had surpassed all the other forces within the Northern Spiritual Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingtian glanced at Mu Feng, who had a calm expression, and smiled wickedly. </span><i><span style>Mu Feng, Mu Feng, there is no chance of you turning the tables this time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohoho, what Senior Liu said is correct. We cannot just occupy a corner of the land throughout our lives. My White Horse Clan is willing to join the Northern Spiritual Alliance and serve Senior as our chieftain.” The clan leader of the White Horse Clan, who spoke earlier, was the first to reply. He had a flattering expression, which made many curl their lips in disgust at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were disgusted by his act, the situation had gone beyond many people’s expectations. Under Liu Jingshan’s indifferent gaze, the leaders of many forces did not dare to argue back. At this moment, Lie Yan was still lying down on the ground. He was a Spirit Stage powerhouse, yet he didn’t possess the strength to fight back against Liu Jingshan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The true difference between a Spirit Stage and a Heavenly Fusion Stage had been revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, a few forces immediately followed the White Horse Clan and accepted the union. However, the remaining 8 territories’ Territory Lord did not present their views yet. It was evident that they were struggling unwillingly within their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan watched this scene calmly. Then, his eyes turned towards the 8 Territory Lords as he said slowly: “What about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 8 Territory Lord exchanged gazes with each other. Every single one of them had an exceptionally ugly expression plastered on their face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Liu…” Tang Shan sighed and cupped his hand, “The Tang Territory is the something that I’ve devoted my life to. Therefore, I’m afraid that I cannot accept your invitation to join this union.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it seems that Territory Lord Tang Shan isn’t interested in becoming an ally of mine. if that’s the case…” Liu Jingshan smiled faintly. However, the smile gradually turned cold. The Spiritual Energy Pressure that filled the temple instantly gathered at Tang Shan’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Shan’s body suddenly became tense. In the next moment, dense Spiritual Energy erupted out from his body. The Spiritual Energy lights formed a golden tiger behind him, as a powerful Spiritual Energy emitted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden tiger unleashed a roar. Ferocity flashed through Tang Shan’s eyes, as he charged forward. The Spiritual Energy surged out and formed a golden claw. Then, it smashed viciously towards Liu Jingshan at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Shan knew how powerful Liu Jingshan was. Therefore, he had to put all of his strength into his attacks. When facing a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse, he must have the mindset of going all out from the very beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But against Tang Shan’s violent offense, Liu Jingshan remained motionless. A touch of ridicule flashed through his murky eyes. He extended his bony hand out and smacked casually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant Liu Jingshan smacked downwards with his palm, the Spiritual Aura within the world seemed to be affected by it. It gathered at his palm at an extraordinary speed and instantly turned into a giant clump of Spiritual Energy. Afterwards, it smacked down and collided against Tang Shan’s fierce offensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shockwaves of Violent Spiritual Energy spread throughout the temple. Cracks suddenly spread through the ground, and even a few pillars were smashed to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puchi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flying through the sky, Tang Shan suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. The golden tiger behind his back dimmed as he flew backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just one attack, Tang Shan, who was close to being a Spirit Stage Late Phase, had been completely defeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad!” Seeing Tang Shan gravely injured, Tang Qian’Er’s face turned pale and she urgently called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan remained motionless with an indifferent expression. Separated by air, he let out a punch. Rampaging Spiritual Energy surged out and smashed fiercely towards Tang Shan. Judging from his appearance, it seemed that Liu Jingshan was going to land the killing blow in order to set an example.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Mu Feng’s eyes turned cold. He tilted his head and quickly said to Zhou Ye: “Zhou Ye, if the situation goes terribly, take Mu Chen and leave. Go hide inside the Northern Spiritual Academy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Ye’s face twitched. He knew that even Mu Feng did not have the slightest confidence of dealing with this crisis. To them, a Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse was much too powerful. It was enough to break the balance within the Northern Spiritual Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen remained silent. However, he was clenching his fists tightly. At the same time, a hint of madness flashed through his slightly drooped eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not enjoy watching his loved ones being killed while he escaped to a place far away, in order to get revenge a few years later. It wasn’t part of his character to just sit and watch. He would rather fight with all he’s got and seek a chance for survival amidst the near-death situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Mu Feng quickly informed Zhou Ye, his body rushed out and appeared in front of Tang Shan. Spiritual Energy rushed out unreservedly from his body as he fired off a punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fiery red Spiritual Energy swept out like flames. It collided heavily against the Spiritual Energy attack that was blasted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Again, Violent Spiritual Energy shockwaves erupted out. Mu Feng’s body shook and he quickly retreated a dozen steps. His fist was also shaking. Then, he stared solemnly at Liu Jingshan and said in a deep voice, “Senior Liu, is it necessary to act this savagely?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mu Feng, huh? When you built a reputation for yourself, you were still a young boy. I never expected that you would be able to obtain the accomplishments you have today. You’re quite amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan looked calmly at Mu Feng. A flash of coldness appeared within his sunken eyes as he said: “However, no matter who it is, I will personally kill them if they dare to interfere with the Liu Territory dominating the Northern Spiritual Realm today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, I’ll want to seek guidance from Senior Liu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Feng’s eyes turned cold. He knew that the Mu Territory and Liu Territory were enemies. Liu Jingshan would never let them go this easily. If that’s the case anyway, why not fight to the bitter end?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Mu, I’ll fight with you,” Tang Shan exclaimed. Mu Feng by himself definitely was not Liu Jingshan’s opponent. If they did not join forces during this moment, they wouldn’t have the chance to do so in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone. I do not want to hand over the efforts that I have devoted half my life to, to the Liu Territory. If you’re still worrying about the consequences, the next one to be targeted will be you!” Tang Shan glanced at the other Territory Lords as he shouted out these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Tang Shan’s cry, the other 6 Territory Lords’ expressions changed. If they attacked, it would mean that they chose that camp. However, if they let Mu Feng and Tang Shan be defeated, they wouldn’t have another choice and could only grovel beneath the Liu Territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Senior Liu. You’ve really gone overboard this time. My Hong Territory is doing fine right now. We do not want to join the Northern Spiritual Alliance!” Hong Territory’s Territory Lord, Hong Ling<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, gritted her teeth and screamed out loud.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Luo Territory does not wish to join either!” Luo Territory’s Territory Lord also agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Yan Territory as well!” Lie Yan, who was injured by Liu Jingshan earlier, shouted out in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a few seconds, including Mu Feng and Tang Shan, a total of 5 Territory Lords stepped forward against Liu Jingshan. The remaining 3 Territory Lords were still wavering. A Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse simply gave off far too much pressure for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the temple, many leaders watched the scene progress. Their faces turned pale. How many years had it been since they’d seen such a formation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five Territory Lords, huh, is there anyone else?” Liu Jingshan’s eyes glanced at Mu Feng and the others. He actually grinned and let out a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A group of ignorant fools…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan suddenly straightened up his hunched-over body. His grey robe fluttered without any winds as an amazing Spiritual Energy stormed out within the temple. In an instant, more cracks began to appear throughout the temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan’s murky eyes turned ferocious. He took a step forward fiercely, as if he was an avalanche raining down from above. The large temple could not withstand the massive Spiritual Energy and began to collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanied with an amazing Spiritual Energy, Liu Jingshan’s voice, which was dripping with killing intent, resounded out through the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since these are your decisions, don’t blame me for being merciless!”</span></p>
