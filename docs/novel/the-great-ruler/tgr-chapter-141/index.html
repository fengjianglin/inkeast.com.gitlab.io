 <p><b>Chapter 141 – Bloodline Bond</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Bloodline Bond?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen seemed &nbsp;slightly stunned as he repeated these words slowly back to himself. Then, his eyes sparkled as he looked at the Nine Netherbird and asked: “What’s that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s something that only a member of an ancient Divine Beast’s lineage can do. Simply put, it uses a special technique to link our bloodlines together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A benefit is that you will possess my abilities. This is a higher ranked method of obtaining a Spiritual Beast’s abilities compared to simply ingesting the Soul Essence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint thought was conveyed over by the Nine Netherbird: “The disadvantage of this is that we will form a tight connection with each other. If you were to die, I would die as well. Similarly, if I die, you will die as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen froze immediately and smiled bitterly: “Isn’t this quite vicious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop pretending. Although humans are able to increase their lifespan through cultivation, but based on an ordinary death, you are the ones that would definitely die first unless you somehow managed to cultivate to an extremely high level.” The Nine Netherbird said disdainfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And you think that I’m willing to form a Bloodline Bond with an insect-like human? The Nine Netherbird possesses the bloodline of the ancient Undying Bird. Compared to everything about you, it is many times more noble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t even know how many people attempted to form a Bloodline Bond with us. Despite that, the Nine Netherbird race has never done such a shameful act. If it wasn’t for the fact that there isn’t another method, I would never have suggested such a thing in the first place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of anger was within the thought that was conveyed over. When humans ingested a Soul Essence and erased the Spiritual Beast’s will, it was one of the most despicable and lowly act of obtaining the Spiritual Beast’s capabilities. However, a Bloodline Bond surpasses the act of ingesting in terms of method and potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is because this was the only method that could fuse two bloodlines together, allowing the cultivator to use an extremely formidable power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a Bloodline Bond requires agreement from both parties. To high rank existences, it was simply a disgrace for them to lay down their dignity and willingly form a Bloodline Bond with humans. Therefore, they would rather be completely obliterated instead of doing such a thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen smiled helplessly. After all, this entire thing had happened because of the Nine Netherbird. Who told it to be so greedy and to swallow two Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essence at once?</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the sounds of it, the Bloodline Bond possesses many benefits to him. However, Mu Chen felt a bit off as he would have to bundle his life together with someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you agree or not? Stop acting so indecisive!” Seeing Mu Chen turn silent, the Nine Netherbird spoke up immediately. It could feel the purple golden web gradually tightening on itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen sighed and nodded. He immediately turned serious and said: “Although there isn’t much meaning in me saying this, I would like to clarify that I do not have much desire to form this Bloodline Bond. I only promised because I owe you favor. And now, there is only one method of resolving this dilemma. Otherwise, no matter how many benefits I would obtain, I would not tie my life together with someone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird was truly powerful. However, Mu Chen wasn’t someone who would sacrifice something that he adheres to just for strength. He had confidence in himself. Perhaps he wasn’t as powerful as the Nine Netherbird currently, but he firmly believed in this sentence: Nobody could predict how powerful he would be in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the future, it was possible for him to surpass the Nine Netherbird in strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird grunted and did not make a rebuttal. It was not afraid of death; otherwise, it would not have directly face off against the Black Divine Lightning. After being together with Mu Chen, it had gradually come to understand him. The earlier act of Mu Chen touching the purple golden web without knowing whether or not it would harm him had made it feel a little bit touched. Thus, it believed that the person in front of it was at least a little bit better than the other despicable humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, it proposed to form the Bloodline Bond. To &nbsp;a certain extent, it had recognized Mu Chen as an individual. Otherwise, it would rather die instead of making such a choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry. I don’t have much time.” Mu Chen urged the Nine Netherbird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave the Bloodline Bond to me. If you have the slightest resistance or reluctance, it will cause the bond to fail. Also, you will only have one chance on performing this bond. Once it fails, we will never be able to form a bond again.” The Nine Netherbird reminded Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This method sure is harsh.” Mu Chen was slightly surprised and immediately nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, the Nine Netherbird suddenly flapped its wings and a black flame erupted from its body. Then, it quickly formed into a black pattern between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black pattern formed by the black flames gave off an extremely mysterious feeling. It seemed to communicate with something mysterious within the human’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Place a drop of Blood Essence inside the black pattern.” The Nine Netherbird said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Mu Chen extended out a finger. A scarlet drop of blood shot out from his fingertips and landed inside the flaming black pattern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chi Chi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the fresh blood contaminated the black pattern, white mist erupted out in bursts. However, it did not evaporate away. Instead, it fused itself inside the black pattern and slowly surged through the pattern. In the end, it occupied half of the black pattern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of seriousness filled the Nine Netherbird’s eyes at this moment. A black light flashed on its forehead as a drop of black blood escaped its body. Black flames seemed to be burning within this drop of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This dark-black blood also fused into the black pattern and occupied the other half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two drops of blood each occupied half of the black flame pattern. Then, once the black pattern started to circulate, the two bloods actually made contact together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the instant that the two bloods made contact with each other, Mu Chen and the Nine Netherbird’s body trembled. However, both their gazes remained firmly fixed on the circulating black pattern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it were to fail, the bond between the two of them would also fail. There were no other opportunities for succeeding this act anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the two Blood Essences fused together quite smoothly. It was evident that the bird and human did not have any signs of resisting each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzzzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two Blood Essences fused, a brilliant light erupted out from the black pattern. Black flames rose and directly ignited the pattern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two dark-red Blood Essences erupted out from the black flames and landed respectively on Mu Chen and the Nine Netherbird’s forehead. As the black flames surged, a black flame emblem slowly emerged and entered the depths of their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the black flame emblem entered the depths of their bodies, a mysterious feeling emerged in their hearts. This mysterious feeling made it seem like that their life was shared between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Chen looked at the Nine Netherbird, the latter also stared at him. Both of their eyes showed a hint of complexion. The Bloodline Bond was a success. No matter what, from now on, they were both an important existence to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they had to risk their life, they must protect each other. This is because it is the same as protecting themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the purple golden web that caused severe pain on the Nine Netherbird went through the Nine Netherbird’s body. This time, it did not cause any damages to it. Instead, the two Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences within the Nine Netherbird’s body had their wills erased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once it was aware of this situation, the Nine Netherbird let out a sigh of relief. It stared hatefully at the mandala flower. It had truly lost its power and influence because of this. Thus, once it recovered, it would definitely treat it nicely!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The will within the Mysterious Spirithail Dragon and Geocentric Flame Jalapura has been eliminated. Next up, we will ingest it together. However, the majority of the Spiritual Energy will belong to me. After all, you cannot bear such enormous Spiritual Energy.” The Nine Netherbird spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How fussy, why does it seem like you’re a female?” Mu Chen raised his eyebrow and challenged it. He stared at the Nine Netherbird and asked: “In the end, are you a male or a female? It seems that once a Spiritual Beast is strong enough, it can also shapeshift into a human shape, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business!” As this was mentioned, the Nine Netherbird immediately turned furious. It directly flapped its wings at Mu Chen. Since it had formed a Bloodline Bond with Mu Chen, the mandala flower no longer bound itself inside the cage. Its black wings passed through the light barrier and whacked at Mu Chen’s spirit. This act sent Mu Chen’s spirit flying away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Violent Bird.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen smiled and no longer provoked it. He began to help ingest the massive Spiritual Energy within the two Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences…</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Mu Chen had his thoughts immersed inside his body, he did not sense that the outside danger had already enveloped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside of the mountain’s waterfall, sounds of winds breaking rang out as numerous figures rushed over. They finally emerged in the sky and found Mu Chen, who was sitting cross-legged near the waterfall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, we’ve finally found the boy. Let’s see how he can hide from us now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they stared at Mu Chen’s figure, cold cries rang out. They were truly tired due to the one day chase. It was amazing how tough it was to deal with a boy, who was only at the Spirit Stage Initial Phase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the crowd, Xie Guan and the others stared coldly at Mu Chen’s figure. Spiritual Energy surged out as they prepared to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, three figures quickly emerged in front of Mu Chen. It was Ye Qingling, Chu Qi and Fang Zhong. They had followed the pack closely. However, they never imagined that Mu Chen would be discovered. Thus, they were forced to appear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Qi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Guan stared at these three individuals and immediately frowned as he locked his gaze on Chu Qi: “Are you planning on protecting Mu Chen? I’d advise you not to do this, otherwise, you’ll be in trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qi sighed helplessly. He truly had nothing that he could say. Based on this guy’s actions, he would definitely erase Mu Chen’s symbol while taking the two Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, let’s be lenient wherever it’s possible. How about letting us go if Mu Chen hands over the Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences?” Fang Zhong asked. At this moment, they could only attempt to stall for time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, this boy is truly irritating. He made us waste so much of our time. How could we forgive him that easily? You should hurry and scram, otherwise, we’ll deal with you as well!” Wu Hu, who had reached the Spirit Stage Late Phase, immediately turned cold as he shouted out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, we can’t let you succeed either!” Chu Qi gritted his teeth and responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think you can stop us with the three of you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Hu sneered as he charged over. Dense Spiritual Energy surged out as it bombarded the trio.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Wu Hu attack, Chu Qi also shouted out. The three of them cooperated with each other and powerful Spiritual Energy collided against Wu Hu’s attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two attacks collided with each other, the Spiritual Energy shockwave directly caused numerous ripples to occur in the waterfall. However, Wu Hu’s body only retreated back two steps while Chu Qi and the others retreated dozens of steps. At the same time, Ye Qingling, who was the weakest of the trio, turned slightly pale. After all, there was quite a bit of difference between a Spirit Stage Late Phase and her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, SCRAM!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Hu charged out again. A punch was blasted out and sent Chu Qi and the others flying away. Then, he immediately appeared in front of Mu Chen and grinned: “Dogsh*t Blood Calamity Mu Chen, wake up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He grinned villainously and dense Spiritual Energy charged at Mu Chen’s chest. It was evident that he was planning to force &nbsp;the latter to wake up from the state of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Chu Qi and the others’ expression changed. It was apparent that Mu Chen was in the state of cultivation. If he was disturbed, it was likely that the Spiritual Energy would backlash on him, causing severe injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But just when their expressions changed drastically, a sharp sound of winds breaking resounded out from the distant horizon. Under Wu Hu’s surprised gaze, a sharp, black light seemed to appear from the void and shot through his thighs, nailing him to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“AH!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Screams resounded out from Wu Hu immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sudden change of events made the other Spirit Stage powerhouses’ expressions change. They immediately shouted out: “Who?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every one of them lifted their heads as they stared at the distant horizon. From that location, a bright light was rushing over. In a couple of seconds, it turned into a figure of light as it landed in front of Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Chu Qi stared at the slender figure, the corner of his eyes twitched rapidly. He could not believe what he was seeing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This familiar figure…Was it Luo Li?</span></p>
