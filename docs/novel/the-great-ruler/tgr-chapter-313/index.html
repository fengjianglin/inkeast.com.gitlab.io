 <p><strong>Chapter 313 - The Might of Twin Lotus</strong></p>
 <p>As the gigantic light array in the air slowly took shape, countless Spiritual Energy light rays explosively shot out. After mutually weaving and taking shape, they formed an outline of an incomparably gigantic and complicated array diagram.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Energy within this stretch of the world turned rebellious, as Spiritual Energy erupted forth akin to streaks of light, endlessly streaming and pouring into the Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>In the front, the Spirit King, who was relying on his mad and violent attacks to force the defending Luo Li to ceasely retreat, suddenly saw the gigantic Spiritual Array from in the sky before it. As it was formed by the convergence of the Spiritual Energy of the world, it was naturally extremely sensitive to such a gigantic gathering of Spiritual Energy. From the Spiritual Array, it could sense a considerably astonishing amount of power within it.</p>
 <p>This made it feel somewhat uneasy.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>While roaring, it grabbed a gigantic boulder hundreds of metres large. Spiritual Energy enveloped the boulder, before the Spirit King violently threw it, shooting it towards the glowing array that was gradually taking shape in an attempt to destroy it.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>However, just as the gigantic boulder was thrown, a gigantic azure-glowing sword howled. It proceeded to cut the gigantic boulder up, transforming into broken rocks that blotted the skies as they dropped down.</p>
 <p>The Spirit King furiously roared. It fanned its giant palm out once again, carrying along frightening Spiritual Energy as it furiously smashed down towards the young girl that was blocking it all, along with a single trace of mercy.</p>
 <p>Under its berserk attack, the glowing sword surrounding Luo Li’s body gradually shrank, as it was obviously being thoroughly suppressed. On the jade-like hand that was tightly gripping the longsword, fresh blood started to ooze out. However, she tightly bit her lip, refusing to allow the Spirit King to pass her.</p>
 <p>How could blocking the Spirit King’s terrifying attacks by oneself be an easy matter, even with a Divine Weapon like the Luo Shen Sword in her hand? However, it was, after all, still in its sealed state.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of everything, she would never retreat, as Mu Chen was behind her. The current him obviously could not be agitated or disrupted.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The Spirit King furiously roared as its attacks became increasingly erratic. The sword glow that enveloped Luo Li’s body gradually became teetering on the brink of collapse.</p>
 <p>In the sky behind her, the light array became all the more brighter. Following the gradual completion of the outline of the diagram, the Spiritual Array faintly took shape. From the looks of it, it seemed like a gigantic black lotus.</p>
 <p>“Is that the Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array?” Upon seeing this Spiritual Array that was not considered foreign, the foreheads of Xu Huang and the rest wrinkled. They naturally knew that Mu Chen had used this array in his exchange with Li Xuantong. Although it was formidable, it was, seemingly, still a 4th Rank Spiritual Array. However, how could it have such prestige and power? If it was a Rank 4 Spiritual Array, it would obviously be a very stupid thing to use it to deal with this Spirit King.</p>
 <p>“No…”</p>
 <p>Xu Huang’s eyes suddenly narrowed, as he could see another glowing outline beside the already formed black lotus glowing array. Unexpectedly, it was another gigantic black glowing lotus.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, this Spiritual Array had two black lotuses.</p>
 <p>Although from the looks of it, it was just another black lotus. However, its might and power had a gargantuan change. Although Xu Huan wasn’t a Spiritual Array Master, he was able to feel that this current Spiritual Array was absolutely something that the previous “Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array” could not compare to.</p>
 <p>‘No wonder, the Spiritual Array that this fellow displayed before, was not complete…’ Xu Huang thought. Naturally, he did not assume that this Spiritual Array was created by Mu Chen. He was very clear that this kind of capability was absolutely not something that Mu Chen could possess. Therefore, there was only one reason, which was that the Spiritual Array that Mu Chen had displayed before, was not complete.</p>
 <p>The two black lotuses slowly revolved in the air, as the entire stretch of the world seemed to turn much darker and deeper, with gales suddenly erupting.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen raised his head to look at the formed Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array, before exhaling deeply, spitting out a lump of white air. Following his increasing profundity in his attainments in Spiritual Arrays, his feelings and comprehension of the “Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array” had obviously grown deeper. If not, he would not dare to try to use it in a situation like this.</p>
 <p>As of now, he had already managed to feel the depths of the Spiritual Array that was once mysterious and unfathomable in his eyes. According to his estimates, the Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array should have four parts. If he could complete the entire formation, there should be four black lotuses appearing. Naturally, that form of the Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array, might be a 7th Rank Spiritual Array. Its might would be terrifying enough to scare people. Even a Heavenly Completion Stage expert would turn to dust under a Spiritual Array of that rank.</p>
 <p>The current Mu Chen still did not have the capability to reach that level. Even the second black lotus that he had condensed was due to him touching the “Heart Eye” state by chance. Therefore, wanting all four lotuses to appear would obviously need some time.</p>
 <p>“Luo Li.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s pupils that seemingly reflected the image of the two black lotuses looked towards the berserking Spirit King. A cold glint surfaced in his eyes as he gently spoke out.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Mu Chen’s voice, Luo Li slightly nodded her beautiful head before her lovable figure swiftly retreated. Landing beside Mu Chen, her hand was still gripping her longsword, taking precautions, while staring at the Spirit King.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>After losing the obstruction, the Spirit King turned its eyes, sparkling with brilliance, at Mu Chen. Without the slightest degree of hesitation, it immediately stepped forward with a earth moving and mountain shaking pace. As it furiously stepped over the land, its figure rushed towards the horizon, akin to a radiant meteor. Carrying a frightening impact force, it violently arrived before Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Bang! Rumble!</p>
 <p>Under the impact, the mountain peak that Mu Chen and Luo Li were standing on collapsed, and the surrounding earth caved in.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s expression remained indifferent. With a change of his hand seals, the two gigantic black lotuses in the air suddenly faced towards each other. Spiritual Energy erratically condensed within the centre of the lotuses before they shot out.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Two glowing Spiritual Energy pillars that seemed almost corporeal collided at the same time. However, there wasn’t any repulsion nor explosion. Instead, they rapidly fused together. In a short span of a few breaths, the brilliance faded. Even the gigantic Spiritual Arrays had slightly dissipated.</p>
 <p>While this happened, a 3 metre large glowing lotus appeared. Although this glowing lotus wasn’t large, the fluctuations radiating from it were considerably terrifying. The glowing lotus contracted and expanded, akin to a beating heart, while giving off a demonic and strange sensation.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked at the 3 metre high demonic and strange glowing lotus. With a flick of his finger, the glowing lotus explosively shot out. Creating a streak of light as it travelled, it rushed towards the gigantic radiant meteor that was headed towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>The speed of the two were exceedingly quick. Within a short span of a number of breaths, they were about to collide high in the sky.</p>
 <p>However, at the instant they were about to collide, a cold smile rose from the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth as his palm suddenly clenched.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The radiant meteor that the Spirit King had transformed into suddenly, intensely, vibrated. Within the Spirit King’s body, there seemed to be a dark black fire starting to burn as it scuttled around.</p>
 <p>Those black flames were not thick. However, with the body of the Spirit King that was brimming with Spiritual Energy, it created quite a big ruckus. As the black flames moved about, it started to continuously ignite and burn the Spiritual Energy.</p>
 <p>This was the lump of black flames that Mu Chen had sneakily placed into the Spirit Crystal. When the Spirit King had devoured it into its body, it had also devoured the black flames. Although the Spirit King had boundless Spiritual Energy, and these black flames were incapable of doing any harm to it, it had given Mu Chen an advantage in this battle.</p>
 <p>Indeed, as what Mu Chen had expected, the black flames were quickly annihilated the endless streams of Spiritual Energy. However, the eye-piercing brilliance around the Spirit King’s body still turned dim for an instant.</p>
 <p>It was at this very instant that the demonic and strange glowing lotus shot violently towards the Spirit King’s chest.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A gigantic and clear sound resonated across the stretch of the world as Spiritual Energy shockwaves swept out. Spiritual Energy hurricanes had seemingly erupted in this stretch of the world, as countless giant rocks were swept into the air, before being shattered into dust.</p>
 <p>The gigantic body of the Spirit King shot backwards, towards the far distance, under the terrified gazes of several people, before heavily impacting the ground. The entire mountain range vibrated at this instant, as a number of mountain peaks in the distance were smashed till they became flat ground. The Spirit King’s gigantic body was within the rubble.</p>
 <p>Xu Huang, Zhao Qingshan and the rest casted their gazes over. After being smashed head-on by such a formidable Spiritual Array, even the Spirit King could not ignore such damage, right?</p>
 <p>Under their attentive gazes, the distant mountain range started to shake again. Within the dust that blotted the skies, a gigantic figure started to stagger and stand up.</p>
 <p>“It's still alive!”</p>
 <p>A tremor shook their hearts; however, there was some unexpected rejoice in them.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen stood at the mountain peak and fixed his eyes on the gigantic figure in the distance that had stood up within the dust that blotted the sky. However, there wasn’t even the slightest degree of fluctuation on that handsome and outstanding face as he quietly continued to watch it.</p>
 <p>As the dust slowly scattered, the Spirit King came into view once again. However, as of now, it did not have the boldness and powerful feeling it previously had. On its chest was a foot long hole, while its surroundings were filled with cracks. Those cracks had seemingly crawled over half of its body. There was even one crack that extended from its chest all the way to the eye-piercing crystal on his forehead.</p>
 <p>Xu Huang and the rest had similarly noticed this spectacle, and unable to control themselves, the corner of their mouths twitched. Terror even flashed within Mu Fengyang’s eyes, as no one could have thought that Mu Chen was actually able to injure the Spirit King to such a degree.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The Spirit King faced the sky and roared, as it could feel the heavy injuries that it had suffered. The Spiritual Energy was rapidly escaping from it. Although it did not have the sensory organs to feel pain, the escaping Spiritual Energy made it feel anger and fury.</p>
 <p>The earth trembled again as it suddenly rushed forward in a berserk fashion. It’s target was, obviously, Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Seeing the aggressive and overbearing Spirit King rushing over, Mu Chen’s forehead slightly wrinkled. Although the latter had suffered serious injuries, an injured tiger was still dangerous. Regardless of whatever happened, the Spirit King was still an existence comparable to a Heavenly Completion Stage expert. If not for the black flames he had hidden within the Spirit King’s body that had done miraculous work, Mu Chen might not have been able to injure it to such a degree.</p>
 <p>He tightly clenched his hands as Spiritual Energy burning with black flames erupted from his body. However, at this moment, a cold and jade-like hand grabbed him. Luo Li gave him a faint smile, before speaking in a gentle voice, “Can you let me finish this up?”</p>
 <p>She was able to see that Mu Chen’s current consumption was enormous. Although the Spirit King had suffered serious injuries, the assault before its death would also be very terrifying. In her case, she was more suitable to finish it than Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Mu Chen paused for a bit, before smiling while nodding his head.</p>
 <p>Luo Li started to slowly walk forward. Her jade-like hand that was gripping the Luo Shen Sword slowly rose up, pointing towards the incoming Spirit King. Within those beautiful eyes, a swift and fierce shadow was condensed within.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was able to feel that the Spiritual Energy of this region of the world was fleeing and scattered, as it was unable to withstand the Sword Qi radiating from the body of Luo Li’s sword.</p>
 <p>This Sword Qi even made Mu Chen’s heart palpitate and jump. Looking at the exquisite, delicate and absolutely beautiful face that was akin to chinaware, the little bit of graveness on his face grew by a bit more.</p>
 <p>Luo Li had planned to thoroughly destroy the Spirit King before her eyes.</p>
