 <p><strong>Chapter 295 - Taking them down by ourselves</strong></p>
 <p>“Who says that we can’t take them down by ourselves?”</p>
 <p>When Chen Peng and the rest heard Mu Chen’s indifferent words, they were startled. But, shortly after, he couldn’t help sounding out, “Only two of you possess the strength to deal with Spiritual Knights. Could it be that the two of you will take down seven Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase and one Heavenly Transformation Stage Middle Phase Spiritual Knights by yourself?”</p>
 <p>There was clearly mockery in his speech. Although he had witnessed how formidable Luo Li was earlier on, it was clearly impossible for Mu Chen and Luo Li to deal with the Spiritual Knights formation.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen only cast a glance at them and did not speak anymore nonsense. He shifted his gaze towards the few Spiritual Knights in the depth as he narrowed his eyes.</p>
 <p>Indeed, that formation wasn’t weak.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, can we really deal with them by ourselves?” An Ran’s low voice sounded out. Although she had witnessed the strength displayed by Mu Chen and Luo Li along their way there, she still felt worried when faced with such a formation.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, with those fellows glaring like tigers watching their prey, the slightest error they make would arouse the greed in others.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen smiled as he looked at Luo Li, “Can you deal with them for some time?”</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s gem-like pupils looked at Mu Chen as she replied, “You’re going to lay out a Spiritual Array?”</p>
 <p>“Our minds are, indeed, in sync.” Mu Chen gave her a thumbs up, making Luo Li’s face turn red as she gave him a displeased look. Even at this time, this fellow still had the mood to tease her.</p>
 <p>“Can it be done?”</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s hands tightly gripped her slightly unsheathed black longsword as she smiled. Her graceful figure stood before Mu Chen and withstood all the attacks that were directed at him.</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen saw her actions, he smiled. With Luo Li by his side, he felt particularly at ease as he had absolute trust in her. Even if he were to remove all of his defenses.</p>
 <p>His sight gave a warning glance towards the three other teams with ice-cold intent. Thereafter, he slowly shut his eyes and both of his hands started to form Spiritual Seals. Shortly after, the Spiritual Seals brought along Spiritual Energy ripples as they constantly took form on his palm.</p>
 <p>“Spiritual Seals? He’s going to set up a Spiritual Array?!”</p>
 <p>When the three group saw the surrounding Spiritual Seals forming around Mu Chen, they were instantly startled. They abruptly recalled that the latter still had the identity of a Spiritual Array Master.</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Seals started to form around Mu Chen and, shortly after, an astonishing amount of Spiritual Energy ripples started to spread out.</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Knights at the depths immediately sensed the Spiritual Energy fluctuations. A Spiritual Energy gale was formed as they turned into light figures and charged towards Mu Chen’s direction, along with tyrannical Spiritual Energy that ripped the ground apart.</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s pupils stared at those Spiritual Knights that were charging over as cold intent started to crawl out from the depth of her eyes. Her hands tightly clenched onto her sword hilt without any retreat as she took a step forth under An Ran and the other two girls’ uneasy gazes.</p>
 <p>“She’s trying to obstruct so many Spiritual Knights all by herself?!” When Chen Peng saw the scene before them, his eyes instantly narrowed. Trying to intercept one Heavenly Transformation Stage Middle Phase and seven Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase Spiritual Knights all by herself, wasn’t this something that only someone with Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase strength could accomplish? Could this breathtaking girl with delicate cheeks possess that fearsome strength?</p>
 <p>“Shhhhuuu!”</p>
 <p>Luo Li did not pay any attention to their astonishment as she gripped her longsword and slashed down.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!”</p>
 <p>The dazzling sword light was like the first ray of morning sun as it ripped apart the darkness that illuminated the world. Thereafter, it brought along an unformidable momentum as it hacked the body of several Spiritual Knights at lightning speed.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>There was a huge crack on the ground, causing several Spiritual Knights to be pushed back a few hundred feet, Aside from that Spiritual Knight with Heavenly Transformation Stage Middle Phase strength, the remaining Spiritual Knights had lightly dulled down.</p>
 <p>Clearly, that attack from Luo Li had caused them to be exhausted.</p>
 <p>“How is that possible?!” The remaining group’s hearts were alarmed as their gazes became a little dumbstruck as they looked at the slender girl clothed in black with silvery long hair. How was the latter’s strength so powerful?</p>
 <p>Buzz!</p>
 <p>Those Spiritual Knights did not have any sensation of pain and, henceforth, they quickly charged back towards their direction again. However, Luo Li casually brandished her sword towards their assault as a sword light shot forth. It formed into a sword light defense that could not be torn apart, no matter how those Spiritual Knights attacked.</p>
 <p>Just when Luo Li was obstructing those Spiritual Knights, there were a hundred Spiritual Seals formed around Mu Chen. With a flick of his finger, those Spiritual Seals merged into the sky.</p>
 <p>Spiritual Energy fluctuations started to spread out as Spiritual Energy threads started to construct an outline, forming into a complicated Spiritual Array that could cause others to feel dizzy from looking at it.</p>
 <p>Light rays started to spread out as a gigantic black lotus slowly took form. A ferocious Spiritual Energy fluctuation started to spread out on this horizon.</p>
 <p>“The Spiritual Array that had once withstood an attack from Li Xuantong?” When An Ran and the rest saw that huge black lotus Spiritual Array, their eyes immediately lit up. Back then, when Mu Chen had the Pact of Three moves with Li Xuantong, they were also present and, naturally, they witnessed the Spiritual Array that Mu Chen used to deal with Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Knights seemed to have sensed the powerful ripples that were being emitted from the Spiritual Array up in the sky and their attacks instantly started to be even more frantic and managed to force back the defense formed by Luo Li’s sword light.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t any fluctuation in Luo Li’s eyes as she looked at the Spiritual Knights that were pushing her back. Her hands clenched a little tighter on her longsword as she gave a light smear on her sword sheath. Instantly, there was an extremely cold light that was revealed under the sword sheath.</p>
 <p>“It’s all done.”</p>
 <p>However, just when she was about to move, Mu Chen’s voice suddenly sounded from her rear. Luo Li lightly smiled as she loosened her grip on the sword sheath.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s figure slowly rose up as he looked at the impatient Spiritual Knights. Shortly after, his handsigns changed as he issued a bark, “Butchering Demonic Lotus Spiritual Array!”</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom!</p>
 <p>As he barked, the huge black lotus Spiritual Spiritual Array started to slowly revolve. Spiritual Energy ripples spread out that caused even the air to be twisted.</p>
 <p>Rustle!</p>
 <p>The eight Spiritual Knights burst forth towards the Spiritual Array. Although they did not possess any intellect, they could still feel the great threat coming from the Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen indifferently glared at the charging Spiritual Knights. Shortly after, he lightly made a tap with his finger in the air. The black lotus gradually bloomed as a frightening Spiritual Energy gathered towards the heart of the lotus.</p>
 <p>Shhhhuuu!</p>
 <p>When Spiritual Energy was gathered to the limits, the black lotus shook and a black light shot forth from the heart of the lotus. The black light beam that pierced through the heavens clashed against the bodies of the eight Spiritual Knights.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The black light beam ultimately hit against the ground, causing even the mountain range to tremble and the ground to be torn apart. Ravines started to extend from the depths of the crater.</p>
 <p>When the three groups saw this scene, they were startled to the point that even their faces turned pale. They immediately steadied their figures before directing their gazes towards the central region. There was a bottomless huge hole of roughly a few hundred feet. The pitch black colour made their hearts turn cold.</p>
 <p>As for those eight Spiritual Knights that were at top of the bottomless hole, there was only one light figure floating in the air. The seven Spiritual Knights with strength of Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase cultivation were instantly killed, and turned into deep red light balls that seemed like blazing flames as they floated in the air.</p>
 <p>These were the spiritual lights formed by Spiritual Knights!</p>
 <p>Looking at the seven blazing lumps of light, those from the other three groups instantly had their eyes turn scarlet red. The Spiritual Energy contained in those seven lumps of light was probably stronger then all of the Spiritual Pawns combined!</p>
 <p>“Huuuu. Huuuu.”</p>
 <p>Their breaths were heavy as they couldn’t help taking a step forth. However, in that instant when they took a step forth, a cold gaze shot towards them that caused their heads to clear up.</p>
 <p>Up in the sky, Mu Chen’s expression was indifferent as he stared at those three groups who had their eyes turn red. Hundreds of Spiritual Seals appeared in his surroundings again.</p>
 <p>With his current strength, clearly there wasn’t any difficulty to set up a Rank 4 Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>If those fellows before him didn’t know how to be tactful, he wouldn’t mind giving them another ruthless lesson.</p>
 <p>When the three groups saw the Spiritual Seals around Mu Chen, they immediately stepped back. Honestly, they had no confidence in withstanding that powerful Spiritual Array from Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, there was also a girl here that could easily obstruct the eight Spiritual Knights.</p>
 <p>They exchanged a glance and could see the bitterness within each other’s eyes. If they knew Mu Chen was so frightening to begin with, then they would have just cooperated with them properly. At least they would still have had a share of the harvest.</p>
 <p>But, right now, they had aroused Mu Chen’s disgust for them and they could clearly not get any more harvests.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen indifferently swept an eye at them before retracting it. Thereafter, he looked at the last remaining light figure. That Spiritual Knight possessed the strength of a Heavenly Transformation Stage Middle Phase and, therefore, it was able to withstand that earlier attack from him. But, clearly, it had also suffered heavy injuries.</p>
 <p>Buzz!</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Knight floated up into the sky as it dimmed down. There was a sudden burst of buzzing sounds coming from its body and the seven blazing light lumps had shot towards that Spiritual Knight.</p>
 <p>The seven other Spiritual Lights were actually absorbed by it!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>When the other seven light balls charged into that Spiritual Knight’s body, a surge of violent Spiritual Energy abruptly swept out. Under the impact of that Spiritual Energy, it caused the stones that were within a radius of a thousand feet to be reduced to dust.</p>
 <p>“It's strength is surging!” An Ran exclaimed. After absorbing the seven other spiritual lights, the Spiritual Knight’s strength was constantly pressing towards Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase.</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen saw this unforeseen event, his face slightly changed. However, just when he was about to step forth, Luo Li, who was ahead of him, took the lead instead.</p>
 <p>Her exquisite figure turned into a graceful streak of light as her hand gripped the sword hilt. She placed her hand onto the cold sword sheath and suddenly drew her sword.</p>
 <p>Buzz!</p>
 <p>A sword cry soared into the heavens and everyone could sense a frightening sword light streaking across the horizon.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>A mountain peak from far away was sliced and the region that it had sliced became as smooth as a mirror.</p>
 <p>Tingling.</p>
 <p>Luo Li appeared behind the Spiritual Knight as the longsword in her hand was quietly sheathed. A sharp and crisp sound rippled out and the Spiritual Knight, whose strength was surging, burst open. Eight brilliant and abnormal light lumps whistled out.</p>
 <p>Luo Li swept her hand and the eight dazzling light lumps fell into her hand as they appeared like deep scarlet blazing flames.</p>
 <p>With just one sword, she instantly killed the Spiritual Knight whose strength was about to reach Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase.</p>
