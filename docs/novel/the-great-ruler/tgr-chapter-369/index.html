 <p><strong>Chapter 369 - Four-Sided Confrontation</strong></p>
 <p>Due to the appearance of the group of people in the sky, the atmosphere within the entire Western Desolated City had flared up and boiled. Curiosity was present within the eyes of countless people, since all of them clearly wanted to know exactly who would be able to achieve the final victory in this head-on confrontation between the two lineups.</p>
 <p>This battle would undeniably concern various aspects and faces of the Demonic Dragon Palace, as well as the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Both sides had Sovereigns present within them. Due to various reason, they weren’t able to directly intervene and fight, and could only observe this confrontation in the dark. Therefore, the lineups present before everyone’s eyes were the sharpest and greatest elite forces that both sides could send out.</p>
 <p>As Shen Cangsheng stood haughtily within the sky, his gaze locked onto Mo Longzi, which was akin to the edge of a blade. Shifting slightly up, he noticed the three gigantic metal cages that had the unconscious and heavily injured Lin Zheng, Zhou Qingshan and Gu Tianyan within them.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the three who were caged up, the faces of Mu Chen and the group turned frosty, while killing intent erupted from their eyes.</p>
 <p>All of them had respect and even some reverence for Lin Zheng and the other two; after all, they were their Senior Brothers. Currently, they were being humiliated in such a manner, causing them the be rather infuriated.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Looks like you all are very furious.”</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi looked at the expressions filled with killing intent present on the faces of Shen Cangsheng, Mu Chen and the group. Showing an apathetic smile, he said, “You guys should be rejoicing that I’ve locked them up here. If not, I’d have finished them off long ago.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll return what you did to them a hundred times over.” Gripping the long spear tightly in his hand, green veins started to squirm and wriggle on his hand. Speaking out, Shen Cangsheng’s low and deep voice was brimming with malevolence.</p>
 <p>“I do know that you truly have that capability,” replied Mo Longzi with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“So what the hell are you going to do now? Send out any move you’ve got, and we’ll return all of them back to you!” roared Shen Cangsheng in a cold voice. In any case, Lin Zheng and the other two were in the hands of their enemies. Thus, they were still a little worried about acting against Mo Longzi in fear of him hurting Lin Zheng and the other two. After all, they weren’t able to be that merciless and completely show the slightest bit of detachment to their compatriots like Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>“Worthy of being the Overlord of the Heavenly Rankings. You truly have charisma and the guts to say such words.”</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi laughed while sticking his thumb out. A sinister shadow filled his face as a smile appeared from a split of his mouth, revealing two rows of glistening white teeth, before speaking out, “It’s really very simple. We’ve set up four arenas over here. You just have send four people up to fight and that’s it.”</p>
 <p>“However, there’s no such thing as a fair matchup. Once these four people have dealt with their opponents, they have to right to decide to withdraw, or continue cooperating with others…”</p>
 <p>“As for the type of fight, it’s naturally to the death.”</p>
 <p>Speaking till the very end, the smile at the corners of Mo Longzi’s mouth turned cruel and malevolent.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen faintly narrowed his eyes when he heard Mo Longzi words. From what the latter had said, he had made it clear that he wanted solo fights, which allowed him to quickly finish off his opponent before helping the rest. In that way, he wouldn’t have to worry about being besieged by Mu Chen’s group. After all, he would face against Shen Cangsheng, who had promoted to Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase. If there was another person attacking him, it would become two against one. In that situation, even he would no longer have an advantage.</p>
 <p>Previously, the reason why he could deal with Lin Zheng and the other two was due to breaking them one by one. If not, when the three of them joined hands to fight with him, it would be nigh impossible to completely capture all of them.</p>
 <p>As this moment, Mo Longzi was also banking on this same concept. He assumed that in a solo fight, no one from Mu Chen’s side would be able to be his match. In that way, he would quickly achieve victory and turn around to deal with the rest.</p>
 <p>This truly would help him avoid being besieged. However, that would have to depend on whether Mo Longzi was truly able to achieve victory so quickly and get his hands free to attack other people.</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, he possessed extremely great confidence in his own strength.</p>
 <p>The eyes of Shen Cangsheng and the group faintly flashed, having clearly seen through Mo Longzi’s intention. In the current situation, they had the numerical advantage, and swarming around Mo Longzi and his group had some advantages for them. However, since Lin Zheng and the other two were within the latter’s hands, they didn’t have much of a say.</p>
 <p>“Look’s like the confidence you have for yourself is truly quite big.”</p>
 <p>Taking a step out, the golden long spear within Shen Cangsheng’s hands erupted with a bright and resplendent golden light. As the golden light blossomed and filled the skies, Shen Cangsheng appeared akin to a god of war. Chilling intent filled his eyes as he stared at Mo Longzi while saying, “We’ll accept this fight!”</p>
 <p>“Haha, that’s some courage!”</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi roared with laughter that had endless chilling intent present in his voice. With a wave of his hand, he fluttered as he retreated back. Shooting across the sky, three other people from his group followed suit and shot out into the sky. In all, they occupied four separate regions within the sky.</p>
 <p>The three people that shot out was Mu Gu, 3rd rank on the Bounty Board, Gui Xiong, 4th rank and the 5th rank Wu Jia.</p>
 <p>Of these three people, two of them possessed strength at the Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase, while the remaining one was a Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master, an even more mysterious and hard person to deal with. All fourth of them weren’t people that Mu Chen and his group could easily deal with.</p>
 <p>Haha! Who dares to fight with me?!”</p>
 <p>Gui Xiong flung his head up, roaring with laughter as astonishingly baleful aura pervaded his entire body. Looking malevolently towards Mu Chen and his group , the giant axe within his hand appeared as if he wanted to split up and shatter the heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>Mu Gu also had an apathetic smile on his face, while his skinny and withered body sparkled. The bones underneath his skin became faintly discernable under his skin. Locking his gaze onto Luo Li, it appeared as if the fight that occurred yesterday had yet to reach a desirable level of satisfaction.</p>
 <p>Compared to the other three, Wu Jia was the most quiet and solemn. Calmly sitting in the sky, the air around his body faintly rippled, while mysterious fluctuations radiated from him.</p>
 <p>This person appeared akin to a venomous snake. He made no noise and no detectable movements, but was able to give a death-inducing attack within the silence.</p>
 <p>Within the largest hall in the Western Desolated City, the green-robed male was also looking with interest at the confrontation happening in the skies above the city.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Young Hallmaster. Looks like that Mo Longzi’s truly crafty. His strength should be considered the strongest amongst the individual people on the two sides. In a solo fight, the only person that can put up a fight against him might only be Shen Cangsheng. However, the latter will not be able to last for long. Therefore, once he finishes his fight, this entire situation can be considered to be over,” explained a figure standing behind the green-robed male.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the green-robed male smiled and nodded his head while saying, “However, if the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy achieves victory in the other three fights before that happens, things would be different…”</p>
 <p>“That Mu Gu and Gui Xiong are both at the Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase. Within the group of people from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, only Li Xuantong can cope with one of them, with him even being able to obtain the superiority. However, even though that’s the case, he doesn’t have any way to quickly finish off either one of the formers.”</p>
 <p>“Other than Li Xuantong and Shen Cangsheng, the other people from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy are on the weaker side. Of those remaining, the strongest is that He Yao. However, he’s only at Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase… There’s a beautiful girl, and she is someone that is slightly unable to be seen through by me. Perhaps, she might become the variable in this confrontation…”</p>
 <p>Sweeping his gaze across Mu Chen and his group in the distance, the gaze of the green-robed male finally landed on Mu Chen’s body for an instant, while a mysterious shadow flashed within his eyes. Faintly wrinkling his forehead, he proceeded to say, “Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase…could it be that the current batch of students from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy are that useless?”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore…”</p>
 <p>Turning his gaze towards Wu Jia, who was still being exceptionally quiet in another region of the sky, the green-robed male spoke out in a soft voice, “Of these four people, other than Mo Longzi, Wu Jia, who’s the lowest rank amongst them, is the person that’ll be the most difficult to deal with…”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, the figure standing behind him nodded his head. Although he didn’t have widespread fame, when a Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master truly takes action, he might even be harder to deal with than Mu Gu and Gui Xiong.</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi and the three people were all dreadful opponents. Although the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy held a minute advantage in numerical superiority, they were deprived of that in this fight…</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, they were truly forced to the end of their roads.</p>
 <p>“Haha, what’s the matter? Have you decided already?” asked Mo Longzi with a grin as he looked towards Shen Cangsheng and his group.</p>
 <p>All the eyes within the Western Desolated City had also looked towards Shen Cangsheng and this group. Everyone was very curiously as to how Shen Cangsheng and his group would split up in this present situation.</p>
 <p>“I’ll deal with Mo Longzi.” Shen Cangsheng said in a low and deep voice. Within their group, his strength was considered the strongest. The duty of stalling and obstructing Mo Longzi could only be accomplished by him.</p>
 <p>With regards to this point, there was no one that objected to this.</p>
 <p>“Let me deal with that Mu Gu. I’ll finish him off as fast as possible.” Luo Li said as her jade-like hand tightly gripped her scabbard, while a coldness erupted from within her glass-like eyes.</p>
 <p>“So, that Wu Jia’s left for me?” Li Xuantong suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>Although Wu Jia was ranked the lowest amongst the four, everyone knew how much frightening capability a Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master possessed. Once he was able to arrange his Spiritual Arrays, even people at the Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase would end up in extremely miserable states in front of him.</p>
 <p>Li Xuantong knew about this point, and, therefore, chose to take responsibility and deal with Wu Jia.</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng looked towards Mu Chen. At this moment, the latter’s eyes appeared to slightly narrow as he started at Wu Jia, who was sitting quietly in the sky. Gently shaking his head, Mu Chen said, “Let me deal with him. I’m also a Spiritual Array Master.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen didn’t doubt Li Xuantong’s strength. However, that Wu Jia’s actions and methods were strange and bizarre. Even if the latter was unable to finish off Li Xuantong in an instant, once he completed the arrangements of his Spiritual Arrays, wanting to tie Li Xuantong down would become an extremely easy task to accomplish.</p>
 <p>The goal of their enemies was to buy enough time for Mo Longzi. Therefore, the group from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy could absolutely not be tied down by the other three, and needed to finish the other three fights as fast as possible.</p>
 <p>Therefore, on the aspect of dealing with him, Mu Chen, who was also a Spiritual Array Master, was the most ideal choice.</p>
 <p>Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Li Xuantong remained silent for a short period of time, before gently nodding his head while replying, “You be careful.”</p>
 <p>“Since we’ve already decided, let’s move out!”</p>
 <p>Tightly clenching the Golden Lotus War God Spear within his hands, with a low roar, Shen Cangsheng suddenly shot out, appearing right in front of Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>Facing this matchup, everyone had clearly guessed it happening. Thus, everyone didn’t feel surprised about this.</p>
 <p>Li Xuantong had also shot out, and appeared before Gu Xiong.</p>
 <p>Clenching her longsword with her jade-like hand, Luo Li spoke towards Mu Chen in a soft voice, “ Be careful. I’ll finish him off as fast as possible and come help you.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke those words, she shot out, her goal being the distant Mu Gu.</p>
 <p>Her actions instant caused some clamoring noises to erupt within the Western Desolated City. The beautiful young girl that appeared as if she was a Freshman had actually become the opponent of Mu Gu, ranked third on the Bounty Board.</p>
 <p>Across the horizon, only Wu Jia was left being unselected. At this moment, his face still had the same indifferent expression on it as his eyes sparkled, akin to a venomous snake tasting the air with its tongue.</p>
 <p>Everyone stared at the remaining group of people from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Faced against that lowest rank, yet being harder to deal with than Mu Gu and Gui Xiong, Wu Jia, exactly who amongst them would take action?</p>
 <p>Within the great hall, the green-robed male was similarly filled with interest as he stared towards the sky.</p>
 <p>Under the countless guessing gazes within the Western Desolated City, Mu Chen slowly exhaled a clump of white air, before walking out of the group.</p>
 <p>Ah!</p>
 <p>Countless gazes immediately converged together. After identifying Mu Chen’s strength, incredulous expressions immediately erupted on each and every one of their faces.</p>
 <p>This youth, whose strength had only reached Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase, actually dared to take action?</p>
 <p>Within the great hall, the green-robed male had also faintly gawked, before he faintly narrowed his eyes. Gently tapping his finger, he muttered to himself, “A Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase against a Rank 5 Spiritual Array Master…Haha. This truly is interesting…I don’t know if he’s looking to die, or if he truly has some astonishing abilities or methods…”</p>
