 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-b70dcda1-7fff-dca1-dbd9-f4a14813653d" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chapter 751 - Great Havenlaw Army</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala wasn’t casually speaking when she mentioned training. Because when Mu Chen was inspecting the preparation troop the next day, a little girl in black flew over, then stepped on the air, and stood on a stone lion with her hands crossed before her. Her golden pupils were looking at him without any emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We pay our greetings to Lord Ruler!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s sudden appearance caused all the higher hierarchy of the Nine Nether Troop to immediately greet her, even Nine Nether had bowed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala lightly nodded her head and directed her golden pupils at Mu Chen. “Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had a bitter expression, since he never thought that Mandala would come so fast. She had just mentioned it yesterday and came today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But since she had come over personally, he would naturally give her face and could only explain the matter to Nine Nether. Upon hearing that Mandala was going to personally train Mu Chen, a smear of astonishment uncontrollably flashed across Nine Nether’s eyes. She had been in the Great Havenlaw Domain for quite some time now, so she naturally knew that it wasn’t easy to get close to the Domain Ruler, since she pays no attention to her subordinates, not to mention personally training someone at the expense of her time…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past when the Great Havenlaw Domain sent a representative to participate in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, the Great Havenlaw Ruler wouldn’t be bothered to show herself, at most it would be getting the Three Emperors to provide some resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So compared to then, the Great Havenlaw Ruler’s attention for Mu Chen was unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be unappreciative, since the Domain Ruler has thoughts to nurture you, you better live up to her expectations.” Nine Nether looked at Mu Chen with her charming gaze and saw a bitter expression on him, so she couldn’t help getting angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Receiving pointers from an Earth Sovereign expert was a great fortune that countless people yearned for, yet Mu Chen had such an expression, it was something that not even the heavens would tolerate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly smiled, he naturally knew how precious Mandala’s pointers were. Except that he wasn’t too used to her towering identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala did not speak a word, she only cast a glance at Mu Chen with her golden pupils, before turning around to leave. Watching her, Mu Chen bid his farewell to everyone before quickly following up, leaving behind plenty of envious gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala gently paced through the sky of Greatlaw Sky and appeared a thousand feet away. Behind her, Mu Chen turned into a streak of light, closely following behind her. But no matter how he pushed his speed, he could not surpass the petite figure before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala had also noticed this and slowed her speed down, moving with Mu Chen at her side at the same pace. Up in the sky, there were experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain streaking across. When they saw the two of them, they quickly bowed. Only after they left, did they look at Mu Chen’s silhouette with astonishment. Clearly, they were shocked by the fact that Mu Chen could actually fly side-by-side the Great Havenlaw Ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where are we going?” Mu Chen couldn’t help asking as he looked at Mandala.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s golden pupils were looking up ahead, but she did not reply to Mu Chen’s question. On the contrary, she asked instead, “Liu Yan’s strength is capable of standing in the Top 5 amongst the younger generation of the Northern Region. According to my estimations, his current cultivation should be somewhere around Fourth Grade Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, she cast a glance at Mu Chen. “Do not compare Qin Bei’s Fourth Grade Sovereign cultivation to Liu Yan’s. He borrowed the power of pills to forcefully break through. If he fought with Liu Yan, he would not last ten rounds.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s expression turned a little more grave. He had fought with Qin Bei, so he naturally knew how tough such an opponent was. Even though he had exhausted all his cards, he was only able to defeat Qin Bei at the price of suffering heavy injuries. And now, Mandala said that Qin Bei wouldn’t last ten rounds in the hands of Liu Yan…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he knew that Liu Yan wasn’t an ordinary figure right from the start, he didn’t expect him to be so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reputation as the Young Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace was truly not for nought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you are to fight with Liu Yan right now, your chances of winning are low.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala did not give Mu Chen any face with her words, and Mu Chen could only smile in reply. Although he was fearless, that didn’t mean he was a fool. After all, his strength was current at Second Grade Sovereign. The reason why he could defeat Qin Bei was due to the Great Solar Undying Body and the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art. Even if that power was strong, it didn’t allow him to ignore the boundaries of grades. It was already an unbelievable feat that he managed to defeat Qin Bei. If he was to defeat Liu Yan, who was even stronger in comparison, no one could treat him as a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The participants of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven are all outstanding geniuses amongst the younger generation of the Northern Region. Their ages all exceed yours, so it will become your disadvantage when you confront them.” Mandala lightly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. In this sort of battle, as long as the qualification fits, no one would care about your age, only the outcome. They wanted to see how dazzling your process was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So for the next three months, you have to increase your strength to Third Grade Sovereign. Otherwise, you will not be able to walk very far, no matter how many cards you have up your sleeves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s lips twitched. He had just recently broken through to Second Grade Sovereign, so wanting him to make another breakthrough within three months wasn’t an easy feat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he knew that what Mandala said made sense. No matter how many cards he had up his sleeves, the robust degree of one’s Spiritual Energy was the most crucial. Without the support of robust Spiritual Energy, it would just be strong on the outside and weak on the inside, even if he possessed the Great Solar Undying Body and did not possess much fighting capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Doesn’t seem too easy.” Mu Chen scratched his head and honestly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With me around, there’s nothing too hard.” Mandala tilted her head as a smear of a smile appeared on her exquisite face. But that smile was eerily chilly in the eyes of Mu Chen, he couldn’t help but to shiver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the two of them spoke, Mandala had also gradually slowed down her speed. Mu Chen raised his head and looked ahead. He saw a vast black mountain range, and Mandala was leading him towards the most majestic mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s feet came in contact with the ground, he instantly felt a surge of heart pour into his body from his feet. That feeling was as if he was standing on blazing magma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when that surge of heat entered his body, Mu Chen realised in astonishment that the heat had turned into traces of Spiritual Energy that dispersed within his body, and was refined into the robust Spiritual Energy that was circulating within his meridians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this place?” Mu Chen asked in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala did not reply, but walked to the peak of the mountain. Mu Chen quickly followed behind her and saw a huge crater in the peak of the mountain. Judging from the shape, it was actually the mouth of a volcano.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood at the edge of the volcano and looked down. Shortly after, he involuntarily sucked in a breath of chilled air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scarlet magma could be seen in the depths of the volcano, emanating a high temperature. Under the burning temperature, even his five organs and six viscera felt like they were burning upon taking in a breath of the air here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly frowned his brows. The magma here didn’t seem to be ordinary. Because when Mu Chen breathed here, he felt the Spiritual Energy in his body burning as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ordinary magma could not cause the Spiritual Energy to have such a reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This volcano didn’t seem simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a thousand feet away from the magma, but the terrifying heat wave that blew over made Mu Chen feel a stinging pain on his skin, which caused him to quickly circulate his Spiritual Energy to protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and Mandala appeared at the deepest region of the volcano, Mu Chen suddenly heard an orderly voice sounded out. He immediately turned his head over and his pupils narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were black platforms on the surrounding walls, with numerous black-clothed figures that could be seen on those platforms. At this moment, those black-clothed figures were kneeling down on one knee at their direction with respectful expressions hung on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen felt shocked as he stared at those mysterious black-clothed figures. He could sense that every single one of them had powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations. All of them had actually broken through to the Sovereign Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are the most elite army of our Great Havenlaw Domain, the Great Havenlaw Army.” Mandala faintly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inhaled a mouthful of blazing air.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this was the most powerful and mysterious army of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Although the quantity in this army was less than the Nine Nether Troop, Mu Chen knew that if they were to form up, just the sweep of their Battle Will could devastate the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because every single one of them had a cultivation of Sovereign Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing an army that was entirely formed of Sovereign experts, even powerful experts like the Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor would not dare to underestimate them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the black platforms, four figures had soared into the sky and appeared before Mandala, then respectfully saluted her. “We pay our greetings to the Domain Ruler!”</span></p>
