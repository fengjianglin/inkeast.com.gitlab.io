 <p><strong>Chapter 382 - Demonic Dragon Brand</strong></p>
 <p>When Mu Chen and the group returned back to the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, they had undoubtedly attracted countless stares from everywhere. This was especially true when news of the astonishing fight between Mu Chen and Mo Longzi was disseminated out, causing the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to go into shock.</p>
 <p>Any student that heard about this matter would have their jaws drop wide open in shock, turning into a seemingly petrified state. Obviously, this news was somewhat of a fantasy story to them.</p>
 <p>That number two on the Bounty Board, the super fierce character that even Senior Brother Lin Zheng and the Overlord of the Heavenly Rankings, Shen Cangsheng, had lost to had, unexpectedly, suffered a defeat in Mu Chen’s hands?</p>
 <p>The atmosphere within the entire academy was in a fiery state as countless people endlessly sought out the news about the astonishing battles that happened within the Western Desolated City. Within this fiery state, Mu Chen’s fame and prestige had seemingly rose up in a vertical line, with signs of even surpassing Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>This kind of growth rate caused quite a few students to sigh in admiration. After all, Mu Chen had just entered the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy for only a year. However, an achievement of such a degree caused countless students to feel ashamed and respect for him.</p>
 <p>At this stage, there wouldn’t be one that would doubt Mu Chen’s strength anymore. Everyone knew that it wouldn’t take long for Shen Cangsheng’s title as the Overlord of the Heavenly Rankings to change hands…</p>
 <p>Facing such a fiery atmosphere within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, the lead character, Mu Chen, didn’t show too much care about it. Upon reaching the academy, he had quietly holed himself up in the Freshman region to recover and rest from the injuries he had suffered in this life-risking clash with Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t the slightest bit interested in the title of the so-called ‘Overlord of the Heavenly Rankings’. Strength was something that only belonged to oneself, and not something that could be changed by a title. Furthermore, the finally risk-filled victory in the battle at the Western Desolated City didn’t make Mu Chen feel any arrogance. On the contrary, he had even felt some pressure due to it.</p>
 <p>After all, from the news that he had obtained, although Mo Longzi was the number two on their Bounty Board, he wasn’t considered the genuine peak of the younger generation within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Within this vast and expansive continent, there were still some people that represented the true strength at the peak of the younger generation of this continent.</p>
 <p>If he wanted to chase after that group of people, he would clearly need to work even harder. Although those fellows had cultivated longer than him, and were also older than him, Mu Chen didn’t wish to use these as excuses.</p>
 <p>True strength wasn’t separated by age.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>On the third day after Mu Chen had returned to the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, he could be considered to have completely recovered from his injuries. Although he had relied on the demonic energies of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, it had caused injuries within his body. It was fortunate that his fleshly body was exceedingly tyrannical, possessing quite a bit of resistance against the corrosion of the fiendish and demonic energies. Therefore, he wasn’t left in a condition as miserable as last time.</p>
 <p>After recovering from his injuries, he received a transmitted message from Dean Tai Cang.</p>
 <p>Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Conference Hall</p>
 <p>Looking at the six figures within the large hall, shock and astonishment clearly filled Mu Chen’s heart. Not only did he see Dean Tai Cang here, the other five Heavenly Seated Elders were actually present within. Such an impressive lineup could be considered as the highest level within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>“Haha. You’ve done a pretty good job this time, Mu Chen. Firstly, I have to express the gratitude of the Punishment Hall to you. If not for you, our Punishment Hall would suffer a huge loss of face this time.” Upon seeing Mu Chen, the Punishment Hall Hall Master, Mo You, took the initiative and spoke out with a smile.</p>
 <p>Next to Mo You was Zhu Tian, as well as the other three Heavenly Seated Elders. Other than the youthful appearance of Zhu Tian, the other three Elders appeared white-haired and ancient, with deep and abstruse eyes akin to being shrouded by starry skies. Not a single trace of Spiritual Energy fluctuations were present around their bodies. However, one would feel the frightening sensations of them being about to shatter the heavens and rend the earth with a single move.</p>
 <p>“Five Sovereigns…with Dean Tai Cang, that should be six Sovereigns.”</p>
 <p>Shock shook through Mu Chen’s mind. Obviously, this was the most powerful strength of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. The reason why the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was a leviathan in the Northern Heavens Continent was due to their existences, causing the academy to be unshakable.</p>
 <p>Only after an instant did Mu Chen gradually regain his clarity. Giving a respectful bow towards the five Heavenly Seated Elders, he turned towards Dean Tai Cang and said, “Is there any instructions for me, Dean?”</p>
 <p>With a faint smile, Dean Tai Cang replied, “The main reason I’ve summoned you here is due to the matter of that ‘Great Meru Demonic Pillar’ within your body.”</p>
 <p>The five Heavenly Seated Elders immediately cast weird gazes towards Mu Chen’s body. They were clearly familiar towards the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. During that year when the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was in a great war with the Demonic Dragon Palace, if not for the White Dragon Sovereign suddenly betraying the Demonic Dragon Palace and taking away the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, their victory would be more hard pressed.</p>
 <p>They understood the ominous fame of the “Great Meru Demonic Pillar”. It was a strong weapon that would shake even the hearts of Sovereign Stage experts. Although it was ominous and fiendish, once one was able to control it, one would be able to display its terrifying strength.</p>
 <p>However, as of now, such an ominous object had unexpectedly landed in the hands of such a young and weak Freshman. This truly caused people to feel surprised.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was also startled as his heart skipped a beat. <em>Could it be that the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy wants me to hand over the Great Meru Demonic Pillar?</em></p>
 <p>“Hoho. Relax. If our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy does such a thing, how are we different from the Demonic Dragon Palace?” Seemingly able to see the worry within Mu Chen’s heart, Dean Tai Cang spoke out to quell the unease Mu Chen was feeling.</p>
 <p>Having his inner thoughts exposed, Mu Chen felt awkward. However, he wasn’t to blame for having such thoughts. Who allowed the “Great Meru Demonic Pillar” to be so tyrannical to the point where it would tug at the hearts of even Sovereign Stage experts?</p>
 <p>“As of now, although the Great Meru Demonic Pillar has landed in your hands, it still isn’t considered totally yours…” Mo You spoke out with a smile as he continued explaining. “Do you think that the treasure of the Demonic Dragon Palace will get snatched away by other people in such an easy fashion?”</p>
 <p>Immediately, Mu Chen gawked. Starting to frown, he asked, “Hall master’s meaning is that…the Demonic Dragon Palace is able to retrieve it?”</p>
 <p>Speaking until here, his expression turned slightly grave as he thought about the actions that the Black Dragon Sovereign had taken. At that time, if not for Dean Tai Cang, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar might have truly broken out of his body…</p>
 <p>“The Great Meru Demonic Pillar was in the hands of the Demonic Dragon Palace for many years. According to what I know, there should be a Demonic Dragon Brand from the Demonic Dragon Palace. With your strength, it's clear that you’re unable to discover it,” explained Dean Tai Cang.</p>
 <p>“Demonic Dragon Brand?” Mu Chen was stunned as he blankly stared back at Dean Tai Cang. Indeed, he didn’t discover the so-called ‘Demonic Dragon Brand’ within the Great Meru Demonic Pillar.</p>
 <p>“This is the special method of the Demonic Dragon Palace, and it was personally arranged by a Sovereign Stage existence. It hides within the depths of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar and won’t show any activity on any ordinary occasion. However, once the Demonic Dragon Palace activates it, you’ll immediately lose control of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. Furthermore, if they have slightly more killing intent then, your little life will be under their control. With just a single thought from them, they’ll be able to cause the Great Meru Demonic Pillar to erupt from your body.” The person taking this time was the youthful-looking Elder Zhu Tian. Rubbing his chin, he grinned as he stared at Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words cold sweat erupted from Mu Chen’s entire body. If this was true, that would mean that the Great Meru Demonic Pillar had became an explosive? As long as the Demonic Dragon Palace activated the Demonic Dragon Brand, he would definitely be decimated by the energy that was unleashed.</p>
 <p>“In the past, you didn’t expose the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. Therefore, there’s no danger of that. However, as of now, as long as you’re in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, they won’t recklessly activate it. However, once you leave the academy… perhaps that explosive hidden within your body might explode.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen wiped the cold sweat off his forehead as he felt a chill seemingly spread throughout his aurasea. He was afraid that the Great Meru Demonic Pillar would completely explode. With his current strength, he was completely unable to endure it.</p>
 <p>“I don’t think that you’ve called me over just to give me a scare, right, Dean?” Although his heart had skipped a beat, Mu Chen quickly calmed down. Raising his head to look to Dean Tai Cang, he spoke out with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Truly a smart fellow.”</p>
 <p>Unable to resist it, Dean Tai Cang gave a laugh before answering, “You’ve completed your mission this time without a hitch, so a reward should be given to you. After discussing, we’ve decided to help you remove the Demonic Dragon Brand within the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. This way, it will completely break its connection with the Demonic Dragon Palace. In the future, when you’re able to completely tame and control it, it’ll truly be yours.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing those words, Mu Chen was immediately elated. The Demonic Dragon Brand was planted by a Sovereign of the Demonic Dragon Palace, and Mu Chen clearly didn’t possess the ability to remove it. The only one that could help him in this matter would only be Dean Tai Cang and the Elders.</p>
 <p>“Thank you very much, Dean!” Mu Chen showed his heartfelt gratitude.</p>
 <p>Replying with a wave, Dean Tai Cang nodded towards the other five Heavenly Seated Elders, before the five scattered in different directions.</p>
 <p>“Summon the Great Meru Demonic Pillar.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, Mu Chen hesitated awhile. At this moment, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar was suppressed by the mysterious black paper. However, once it was released, it might creat a great commotion…However, after seeming the faint smile on Dean Tai Cang’s face, Mu Chen’s felt much more at ease. With six Sovereign Stage existences guarding him over him, he didn’t believe that the Great Meru Demonic Pillar could create an upheaval!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Mu Chen no longer hesitated. Faintly narrowing his eyes, with a thought, the mysterious Mandala flower in his aurasea slowly blossomed. As this happened, the purple-coloured chains that were wrapped around the Great Meru Demonic Pillar started to slowly retract.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Just as the purple-coloured chains retracted, the Great Meru Demonic Pillar started to crazily vibrate. With a bang, it transformed into a scarlet-red streak of light, rushing straight out of Mu Chen’s aurasea.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>As the scarlet-red streak of light rushed straight out of Mu Chen’s crown, a black demonic pillar followed along the streak of light and rushed out. Demonic energies originating from the ancient antiquity swept out, filling the entire large hall in an instant.</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>The entire large hall vibrated as storms whipped up with the arrival of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. Instantly piercing towards the sky of the large hall, it tried to escape and flee this place.</p>
 <p>Hmph!</p>
 <p>Looking at the gigantic pillar, Dean Tai Cang gave a cold snort. With a wave of his hand, a dazzling brilliance furiously erupted from the ceiling of the large hall. Countless gigantic rays of brilliance formed into chains that explosively shot out. Piercing through space, they immediately wrapped around the Great Meru Demonic Pillar.</p>
 <p>“Suppress it!”</p>
 <p>A deep cry rang out from Mo You, Zhu Tian and the three other Heavenly Seated Elders. Five boundless Spiritual Energies flowed out, akin to liquid streams, while howling from their palms. Wrapping around the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, the demonic energies radiating from it were completely suppressed.</p>
 <p>Humm! Humm!</p>
 <p>The Great Meru Demonic Pillar crazily struggled as it attempted to escape its restraints. As it did so, shattering patterns appeared in the surrounding space.</p>
 <p>A slightly grave expression appeared on the faces of Mo You and the other four Heavenly Seated Elders as slight shock appeared within their hearts. The Great Meru Demonic Pillar was undoubtedly an ominous weapon from the ancient antiquity.</p>
 <p>However, although the Great Meru Demonic Pillar was powerful, the lineup it faced was overly luxurious. As time elapsed, the shock created by the Great Meru Demonic Pillar gradually turned quiet.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Dean Tai Cang brought his hands together to form a hand seal. In the next instant, a ray of boundless Spiritual Energy shot out. Akin to a liquid, it enveloped the entire Great Meru Demonic Pillar within it.</p>
 <p>This liquid-like Spiritual Energy slowly seeped into the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. As it seeped in, Mu Chen noticed some dark and abstruse black light appearing on the surface of the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. From afar, it appeared akin to a pattern of an entrenched demonic dragon!</p>
 <p>Obviously, this was the Demonic Dragon Brand that Dean Tai Cang had talked about!</p>
 <p>“Dispel it!” Chilling intent erupted from Dean Tai Cang’s eyes. Looking towards the Demonic Dragon Brand that appeared akin to a living thing, he gave a shout.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Boundless Spiritual Energies howled from the six people, sweeping towards the Demonic Dragon Brand.</p>
 <p>As Dean Tai Cang and the five Elders were attempting to dispel the Demonic Dragon Brand, within a giant black hall in a far place, the Black Dragon Sovereign, who was cultivating in a sitting position, furiously opened his eyes, while a chilling glow flashed within them.</p>
 <p>“Tai Cang, you really dare to dispel our Demonic Dragon Brand! Okay! Since you want to fight, our Demonic Dragon Palace will have a fight with you first! Let’s see if you have the capability to dispel our Demonic Dragon Brand!”</p>
 <p>Quickly standing up, a low dragon-like roar resounded as spatial fluctuations radiated to far distances.</p>
 <p>As his low roar rang out, a number of furious dragon roars rang out within the deepest depths of the black, giant imperial tomb-like hall. In the next instant, the space in front of the Black Dragon Sovereign distorted as five figures immediately step out of it, appearing within the large hall.</p>
 <p>Following their appearance, a terrifying pressure started to radiate out.</p>
 <p>These five people had impressively possessed Sovereign Stage strength!</p>
