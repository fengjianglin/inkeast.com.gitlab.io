 <p><strong>Chapter 372 - Heart’s Eye Breaks Spiritual Array</strong></p>
 <p>There was a mysterious eye that seemed to have opened from the depths of Mu Chen’s spirit. Looking illusionary, and yet wasn’t, looking real, and yet wasn’t, while seemingly able to see through all the mist that veiled the world.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mu Chen’s eyes slowly sprung open. However, at this moment, those jet-black pupils had transformed into transparent crystal-like appearances. Under those crystal-like eyes, everything in this world seemed to be able to be seen through.</p>
 <p>Every change within the world in front of him was no longer that clear and distinct. The boundless Spiritual Energy was dissected as it appeared within his eyes, returning back into its most basic form as Spiritual Energy of the heavens and earth.</p>
 <p>Looking at the nine divine mountains that were hidden within the eye-dazzling golden light world, the golden light present could no long mask Mu Chen’s vision. Under his crystalline eyes, every single one of the nine divine mountains became transparent, with only the leftmost one still remaining clear and bright. Furthermore, countless glowing Spiritual Energy threads extended from it. These glowing threads were locked on to the other eight divine mountains, while mysterious fluctuations radiated from them.</p>
 <p>This divine mountain was clearly different from the other eight.</p>
 <p>“I’ve finally found you.”</p>
 <p>A faint smile curled from the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth.</p>
 <p>In the distance, sensing the change that happened to Mu Chen, Wu Jia shot a look over. Upon seeing the eyes of the former, which had turned crystalline, an intense shiver shook through his body as an incredulous expression broke apart the darkness present on his face. In the end, he involuntarily cried out, “Heart’s Eye?!”</p>
 <p>Shock and horror filled Wu Jia’s heart. Regardless of anything, he never imagined that the Mu Chen in front of him was actually able to comprehend the Heart’s Eye State! That was a rather high and deep status, and was the yearning dreams of countless Spiritual Array Masters, which naturally included him.</p>
 <p>However, as if the Heart’s Eye State was that easy to comprehend. Countless Spiritual Array Masters have tried their utmost and exhausted all efforts only to fail and be unable to open that mysterious Heart’s Eye. However, this state had somehow appeared on the body of the youth in front of him.</p>
 <p>The shock and mental blow from this revelation caused Wu Jia’s face to turn exceedingly ugly. He had flaunted himself as having absolute talent on the cultivation of Spiritual Arrays. However, he was totally refuted by the Mu Chen present before his eyes.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>While Wu Jia was reeling with shock in his heart, Mu Chen had already furiously shot out, rushing straight towards the genuine divine mountain.</p>
 <p>As long as he could destroy that divine mountain, this giant array would naturally break apart!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Seeing Mu Chen’s action, the expression on Wu Jia’s face contorted. Changing his hand seal, he hastily urged the other eight divine mountains to rush and suppress Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Clenching his hand, black light erupted from Mu Chen as a black pagoda surfaced. In the next instant, gales whipped up as it dramatically swelled, becoming over a thousand feet long as it sat within the sky.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Nine-Layered Pagoda shot forward and violently collided against the eight divine mountains. As it did so, four golden dragons roar out of its body, myriads of golden rays were radiating from them.</p>
 <p>As the Nine-Layered Pagoda blocked the assault from the eight divine mountains, a dragon’s shadow surfaced on Mu Chen’s body. This dragon’s shadow appeared much more corporeal than before. In a supportive state, it carried Mu Chen as he instantly passed through the air, appearing right below the ninth divine mountain.</p>
 <p>Stomping his feet, Mu Chen rushed upwards akin to a great roc. Black lightning crazily arced and danced across his body as he clenched his hand and formed a fist. At this moment, endless brilliance flashed within his crystalline eyes.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>His fist, encased with black lightning and boundless Spiritual Energy, violently rumbled out, before smashing directly against the bottom of the divine mountain.</p>
 <p>“Break!”</p>
 <p>A furious roar resounded across the world akin to a clap of thunder as black lightning spewed out. Gigantic cracks instantly extended out from the location where Mu Chen’s fist struck as intense vibrations shook the majestic divine mountain. As the cracks extended, they finally covered the entire mountain.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Wu Jia’s face violently contorted.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The malevolent and sinister demonic dragon sat within the sky across the horizon. The fiendish aura radiating from it made it appear as if it was a genuine demonic dragon from the ancient antiquity, causing the world the tremble from its presence.</p>
 <p>The faces of countless experts within the Western Desolated City changed as a result as they thought, <em>This Mo Longzi is actually strong to such a degree.</em></p>
 <p>At this moment, the eyes of the green-robed male in the large hall faintly contracted as a result.</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng, this farce will end right here!”</p>
 <p>Standing arrogantly below the demonic dragon, Mo Longzi looked down towards Shen Cangsheng, while a cruel sneer surfaced at the corner of his mouth. Extending his finger out, he gave a tap towards towards Shen Cangsheng in the distance below.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Raising its head to give a long roar, the demonic dragon turned into a black bolt of lightning as it swooped down in a flash. Under the terrifying rush, the space around it started to distort, with the air also exploding apart due to its force, while the Spiritual Energy of the world all scattered away.</p>
 <p>This rushing force was sufficient to crush a Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase expert into dust!</p>
 <p>At this moment, the faces of Su Xuan, He Yao and the rest, who were observing the fight happening in the sky, all turned pale. Obviously, all of them had sensed the terrifying degree of Mo Longzi’s attack.</p>
 <p>Raising his head, Shen Cangsheng looked towards the scene of the demonic dragon diving towards him. As the hands that held his Golden Lotus War God Spear faintly shivered, rampant and fanatical fighting intent erupted from his eyes.</p>
 <p>Taking a step forward, a low roar seemed to ring out from his throat as bright and resplendent golden light erupted from his body, causing him to appear incomparably dazzling. With a shake of his golden spear, it pierced forward in an extremely slow manner.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Creases seemed to appear in the space before it as a shadow of a golden spear hundreds of feet long surfaced behind Shen Cangsheng.</p>
 <p>“Punishment Enforcer Deity Tier Spiritual Art, Punishment Enforcer’s Spear!”</p>
 <p>A low and deep voice resounded as indescribable awe and might erupted from the golden spear’s shadow. The feeling one got from it was akin to a divine enforcer appearing in the sky, causing everyone’s hearts to tremble in fear.</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>The gigantic golden spear’s shadow shot forward, shattering the horizon apart. Under the tight gazes of countless people, it brazenly collided head-on against the swooping demonic dragon!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>An astonishing clap of thunder reverberated across the entire stretch of the world as gigantic gold and black Spiritual Energy storms instantly swept out The bright sky instantly turned dim and dark as furious gales howled about, wreaking havoc and devastation.</p>
 <p>Countless people tightly stared at the gigantic Spiritual Energy storms to were kicked up, while wondering, <em>Is that Shen Cangsheng able to resist against that terrifying attack from Mo Longzi?</em></p>
 <p>Within the large hall, the green-robed male faintly narrowed his eyes, while his gaze remained frozen at the spectacle before him.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Just as his gaze was fluctuating with uncertainty, countless people looked with overwhelming shock and astonishment in their eyes as the Spiritual Energy storms before their eyes were split apart. At this moment, the gigantic spear’s shadow was being violently grasped in the claws of the demonic dragon, which proceeded to give a ferocious clench.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Under the overbearing grip of the demonic dragon, the golden spear’s shadow shattered and broke into pieces. Shooting through the Spiritual Energy storms, the malevolent demonic dragon brought along its frightening shadow as it enveloped over Shen Cangsheng.</p>
 <p>Boundless Spiritual Energy erupted from Shen Cangsheng’s body as a last desperate attempt to protect himself. This was the only thing he could do at this moment.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As Mo Longzi rushed forward, Shen Cangsheng appeared to have suffered a serious injury as blood instantly spewed out from his mouth. Due to the attack from the former, his chest appeared to have somewhat caved in. Rapidly shooting back, he appeared akin to a bird with broken wings, rapidly dropping out of the sky, before violently shooting straight into the ground below.</p>
 <p>The entire earth instantly collapsed at this moment as the surrounding structures instantly crumbled into pieces while gigantic cracks extended from the location of his fall.</p>
 <p>Due to the spectacle unfolding before their eyes, the entire city become much, much quieter at this moment.</p>
 <p>Countless people shot into the sky to look at the area that had collapsed, with dense plumes of dust rising from the location.</p>
 <p>In the distance, the faces of Su Xuan, He Yao and the rest had all been drained of blood as a chill shook through their bodies. This Mo Longzi was that terrifying? Even Shen Cangsheng wasn’t able to stand against him.</p>
 <p>Standing across the horizon, Mo Longzi stared with indifference at the collapsed ground. With a wave of his sleeve, gales whipped up, completely scattering the plumes of dust present.</p>
 <p>As the dust scattered away, everyone could finally see the scene present within. A deep depression had formed on the ground, with Shen Cangsheng, now covered in blood, with his clothes in tatters, swaying and stumbling as he stood within it.</p>
 <p>The long spear was still being grasped in his hands. However, its body appeared dim and dull at this moment, having clearly suffered serious damage.</p>
 <p>Although Shen Cangsheng was still standing, anyone could tell that he shouldn’t have the strength to continue fighting.</p>
 <p>Without Shen Cangsheng restricting him, wouldn’t Mo Longzi be able to immediately control the entire situation?</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng, is there anything left that you want to say?” As he stood in the air, Mo Longzi gave a faint smile, a flavor of victory hanging within. Although Shen Cangsheng was formidable, he hadn’t truly reached the Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase, after all. Therefore, in a head-to-head confrontation with him, the latter simply didn’t have the slightest bit of advantage.</p>
 <p>Tightly staring at Mo Longzi, Shen Cangsheng attempted to revolve his Spiritual Energy, only to result in him spurting more blood out as he staggered and stumbled.</p>
 <p>“Look’s like this fight will ultimately end in the victory for our Demonic Dragon Palace. The Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy is nothing more than this.” Mo Longzi spoke out while shaking his head in pity. Clenching his hand, boundless Spiritual Energy condensed within, while killing intent surfaced within his eyes. Obviously, he had already intended to truly finish Shen Cangsheng at this place. With the latter’s talent, as well as his growth-rate, even he was somewhat dreadful.</p>
 <p>“In your next life, don’t go to such a useless place like the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy again.”</p>
 <p>A ridiculing smile appeared on Mo Longzi’s face as the boundless Spiritual Energy within his hand carried forth his killing intent and rushed out.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>However, right at that instant, the sky in the distance, which was covered by the gigantic Spiritual Array, suddenly emitted an astonishingly loud sound, causing countless people to look over in astonishment. Even Mo Longzi was no exception, since a shiver shook through his body.</p>
 <p>The gigantic Spiritual Energy was intensely vibrating at this moment. With a final loud bang, it completely exploded and shattered apart.</p>
 <p>Glowing dots that blotted the sky scattered and descended.</p>
 <p>Countless gazes turned towards the place that had the densest quantity of glowing dots. At that place, the blurry figures of two people were faintly discernable as they came into view.</p>
 <p>Within the giant hall, expression of the green-robed male started to change. Thick feelings of shock and astonishment erupted from his eyes as he muttered, “How is this possible?”</p>
 <p>As the glowing dots gradually dissipated, the two figures finally appeared. However, as they appeared, the entire city turned deathly silent as everyone’s eyes were filled with shock and amazement.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two figures were in close range of each other. However, one of them had a palm gripping around the throat of the other. At this moment, the latter’s face was deathly pale, while not even daring to make the slightest movement.</p>
 <p>Unable to contain their emotions, Su Xuan covered her mouth, while shocked expressions flooded the face of He Yao and the rest.</p>
 <p>That was because, the one standing there was Mu Chen, while the one being grabbed by the throat, was Wu Jia.</p>
 <p>They had won their fight over there, with the victor being Mu Chen!</p>
