Horrifying Battle Will undulations spread out from those ancient runes, causing intense trembles in space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the huge hand, which was filled with runes, even someone as powerful as the Mountain Splitting King couldn’t help squinting his eyes and his gaze had turned extremely solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The energy that he felt from the huge hand even made him feel fearful. If he had to face such an attack, he had no confidence that he could resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Mountain Splitting King was this shocked, there was no need to talk about the Blood Hawk King and the rest. They were weaker than the Mountain Splitting King, so the danger they felt from the huge hand was even more intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the power of a Battle Formation Master? It’s indeed terrifying.” Nine Nether said with a grave expression. It was no wonder why Zhantai Liuli could lead the Divine Pavilion to defeat the Myriad Saint Peak, which was also a peak force. It turns out that the strength of a genuine Battle Formation Master had exceeded the so-called “Battle Will geniuses”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least in their eyes, the Battle Will that Mu Chen had used now was much stronger than it was a month before. It was on a completely whole new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Mu Chen focused his gaze on the huge hand of Battle Will, before waving his hand. The huge hand dispersed into sparkles of light and the vast Battle Will that covered the horizon started to calm down before whistling down into the five troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle Will calmed down but it did not calm down Mu Chen’s slightly rippling heart. When the Mountain Splitting King and the rest were shocked by the strength of a Battle Formation Master, he was likewise shocked as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because he could more clearly sense the terrifying differences of above and below ten thousand runes. He could affirm that if he encountered the past him, he could probably kill the past him with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine thousand runes and ten thousand runes. It might only be seen as a mere difference of a thousand runes, but there was clearly a change that made the two be on completely different levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current Mu Chen was confident that if it was the power of a Sixth Grade Sovereign, he had nothing to fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle Formation Masters were truly a wonderful occupation. Despite being an alternative route, it was still extremely dazzling and, from a certain degree, it wasn’t any weaker from Spiritual Energy cultivation. It’s just that there was a difference in the foundation of the two. Spiritual Energy cultivators cultivate their own bodies, allowing their bodies to possess a terrifying power comparable to the heavens and earth. Whereas Battle Formation Masters gained power through quantity with the power of troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t a better between the two, they just had slight differences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, perhaps the only flaw of Battle Formation Masters was the requirement to command troops at all times. Otherwise, even powerful Battle Formation Masters weren’t anything to fear without their troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whereas Spiritual Energy cultivators commanded the clouds and rain and stood shoulder to the heavens and earth with their own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both had their own strong aspects. After all, paths of cultivation that could still remain after tens of thousands of years all had their own merits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tremors in Mu Chen’s heart gradually calmed and his figure slowly landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Congratulations, King Mu. From today onwards, our Great Havenlaw Domain finally has a Battle Formation Master. In this Hunting War, I’m afraid that King Mu will be able to greatly display your ability.” The Mountain Splitting King cupped his hands with a smile. His smile was filled with warmth and respect. After all, this world respected the strong and based on the strength that Mu Chen had displayed earlier, it was sufficient to make him feel fearful. Thus, Mu Chen’s age had been completely disregarded by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the praise, Mu Chen smiled as he courteously cupped his fists together before asking about the events that occurred in the Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether and the rest had told him the truth, especially the battle between the Divine Pavilion and the Myriad Saint Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhantai Liuli has indeed become a Battle Formation Master?” Hearing the Kings’ words, Mu Chen wasn’t too surprised. After all, the inheritance that Zhantai Liuli had obtained was more complete than his own. Although the Sky Formation Emperor was inferior to the Nine Tribulation Battle Emperor, who had created the Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique, the technique that Mu Chen had obtained wasn’t complete and he had to probe his way through many things. Whereas Zhantai Liuli had a teacher that had paved her way for her, so it was understandable that she was faster than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right now, Zhantai Liuli’s name is already resounding in the Fallen Battlefield. I believe that after this Hunting War, she will become a famous figure in the Northern Region.” Nine Nether sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing a Ten Thousand Rune Battle Formation Master, even Sixth Grade Sovereigns like them would be extremely fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s also said that the remaining peak forces have been stirred by this matter and are looking for ruins related to Battle Formation Masters. They’re trying to find inheritances so that they can nurture their own Battle Will geniuses into Battle Formation Masters.” The Mountain Splitting King said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. After all, in a war of this scale, the strength of a Battle Formation Master was indeed pretty powerful. So the other peak forces naturally wanted to possess it as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How’s their search going?” Mu Chen asked. This Fallen Battlefield was too vast and they had only searched the tip of an iceberg. Therefore, there would definitely be other fallen Battle Formation Masters aside from the Sky Formation Emperor. There would definitely be the ruins left behind by other Battle Formation Masters as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The other peak forces have been frantically searching for them. No matter what, they will manage to obtain some harvest as well. We have also managed to obtain some information regarding them, it’s just that we’re not able to affirm if it’s true.” Nine Nether briefly pondered as she continued, “But some time ago, there was a piece of information. The Netherworld Palace seems to have fought with the party from the Divine Pavilion that Zhantai Liuli was in and the battle ended in a tie.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen squinted his eyes. The Netherworld Palace was able to get a tie with Zhantai Liuli? Could it be that the Netherworld Palace also had a Battle Formation Master?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We suspect that the Netherworld Palace managed to find a ruin of a Battle Formation Master and obtained the inheritance that was within it, allowing the Battle Will genius of the Netherworld Palace to become a Battle Formation Master.” Nine Nether spoke with a solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. Perhaps only this reason made sense, but it had also made him sigh. In just a short one month period, the situation in the Fallen Battlefield had changed so much. In the past, there wasn’t a single Battle Formation Master. But right now, they started to appear like gushing spring water. Although this Fallen Battlefield was filled with danger, it also contained many opportunities for a carp to turn into a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Netherworld Palace was not a friend of their Great Havenlaw Domain, so Mu Chen was happy to see a dogfight between those two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, Fang Yi of the Divine Pavilion seems to have lost to the Netherworld Prince of the Netherworld Palace in that confrontation.” Nine Nether paused as she continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was immediately stunned upon hearing her words, before he said, sounding somewhat surprised, “The Netherworld Prince’s strength grew so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, when he fought with Fang Yi, the latter was already at the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm. That meant that the Netherworld Prince must have also achieved it as well. Indeed, that fellow couldn’t be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sighed as he looked at the Kings. “Then, what should we do now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We have already accomplished our mission with the amount of Fallen Origin Pellets that we have right now. So I suggest that everyone should gather first, to prevent anything from occurring.” The Mountain Splitting King solemnly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation in the Fallen Battlefield had become increasingly intense that even a peak force like the Myriad Saint Peak had suffered miserable losses. It was so much so that even their Sixth Grade Sovereigns were amongst the casualties. So, right now, they could only gather the Kings to prevent themselves from being surrounded by the other forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. Initially, the King forces of their Great Havenlaw Domain was divided up in the Fallen Battlefield to search for ruins to refine Fallen Origin Pellets. The reason why their party joined together was because the Spiritual Compass in Mu Chen’s hand was able to search for ruins, whereas the other Kings could only rely on themselves.</span></p>

That’s because they would be the perfect target for other peak forces.</span></p>

It was so much so that they might even suffer heavy casualties. After all, at this point in time, individual forces would be in an extremely dangerous situation.</span></p>

Right now, the most important thing that they should do was to gather up. That’s because they would be able to wait for Mandala’s orders that way. As long as Mandala could find an Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury, they would be able to move out all at once.</span></p>

Thus there was no hesitation when they made their decisions. Waving their hands, they each distributed orders down to their subordinates and this mountain range quickly rumbled. Thereafter, innumerable silhouettes soared into the sky and turned into streaks of light that disappeared into the horizon.</span></p>

One of them was the Netherworld Prince of the Netherworld Palace, the other was a black-robed figure that was quietly standing beside him.</span></p>

That person had handed over a scroll with both of his hands in respect.</span></p>

His gaze flickered and he lightly smiled before looking at the black-robed man beside him. “The rat that has been hiding for a month has finally appeared…”</span></p>

He then gently nodded his head and said with a hoarse voice.</span></p>
