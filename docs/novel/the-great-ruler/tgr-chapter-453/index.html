 <p><strong>Chapter 453 - Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, Begins!</strong></p>
 <p>The last two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>When the wisp of the morning sun split apart the darkness and illuminated the world, the atmosphere within the enormous Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had instantly turned into a fervert state. Countless students had faces brimming with emotion and excitement, with the entire academy brimming with an upbeat, excited atmosphere. That’s because today was the start of the greatest event for the countless Spiritual Academies in the Great Thousand Worlds. Today was the official start of the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament.</p>
 <p>This was the greatest official competition for all of the Spiritual Academies, and the gathering point for countless geniuses.</p>
 <p>Only the people that were able to distinguish themselves here would be the true ones with outstanding talent amongst the countless students out there!</p>
 <p>Although the youths participating in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament couldn’t represent all of the youths within the Great Thousand Worlds, there’s absolutely no doubt towards the quality of the champions that were able to distinguish themselves from all of the youths present there. That’s because there was no lack of champions of the past Great Spiritual Academy Tournaments becoming famous Super-level existences within the Great Thousand Worlds.</p>
 <p>As the warm sun rose high into the sky, the atmosphere within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy turned even more scorching hot than the sun beating down a from above. If one swept one’s gaze out, black seas of humans had filled the inner regions of the academy, with even the higher levels of the academy having come out in full force. All of their faces had unconcealable excitement as they took in the scene. Everyone present was very clear that this Great Spiritual Academy Tournament was extremely important to the future of their Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Within a house at the headquarters of the Luo Goddess Association, Mu Chen arranged his robes, one that was a green shade. Pressed against the thin body of the youth, he appeared even more capable and experienced. Present on his chest was the insignia of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, a pine tree standing tall on a mountain peak, bold and upright. Present on the mountain peak was the shadow of a sea dragon, spreading its wings as it seized the heavens and earth in its grasp.</p>
 <p>This was the academy uniform of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, it was extremely rare for a situation as solemn and serious as today. Nevertheless, since they were participating in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament as representatives of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, they naturally had to appear formal and well-knit.</p>
 <p>With his slender physique and handsome face, Mu Chen’s pair of black eyes appeared like the starry sky. Dressed in his soft, green robes, the youth appeared especially dashing, more than sufficient to cause the eyes of anyone that saw him to light up, and God-knows how many young girls would have their stirrings of love surface within their hearts.</p>
 <p>After looking up and down, before feeling adequately satisfied, Mu Chen opened the door and walked out.</p>
 <p>The members of the Luo Goddess Association had long packed the outside of the courtyard. Seeing Mu Chen, who had pushed the doors open, their spirits instantly flared up to a fervert level, as gazes filled with worship and admiration shot over. The majority of the members of the Luo Goddess Association were former Freshmen of the same batch as Mu Chen. Initially, they had followed along Mu Chen and Luo Li when they had created the Luo Goddess Association, allowing for them to receive much less bullying and abuse by the Seniors. As of now, they were able to gain that much fame and prestige within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy all thanks to the bloody battles that Mu Chen had engaged time and time again. Therefore, all of the members of the Luo Goddess Association had worship and admiration stemming from their hearts towards him.</p>
 <p>Sending a big smile towards the large bunch of fellows outside, Mu Chen was just about to say something, before the doors of the next room creaked open. In the next moment, as a wisp of sunlight extended into the cracks of the door, a snow-white, slender leg had slowly extended towards the wisps of sunlight.</p>
 <p>All of the gazes present instantly turned to look at the young girl that had walked out from the room. For a moment, the frenzied clamoring abruptly turned silent as eyeballs started to gradually grow larger, and a shadow of astonishment even flashed within the eyes of Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>It was naturally Luo Li that had walked out from the room. After changing her robes, the clear and cold black skirt that she usually wore was similarly replaced by a green-coloured academy skirt. Being exceedingly figure-hugging, it accentuated the slender and voluptuous curves of the young girl in great detail. Her slender, snow-white neck was as graceful as a swan, while her outstanding chest was accentuated by the blouse to an exceedingly perfect degree. Her little waist that could be grasped with a single arm, her ramrod straight and slender legs…</p>
 <p>Her black hair that was usually let down had now been tied into a ponytail. The ponytail was neatly tied up, quietly resting on the slender waist of the young girl.</p>
 <p>Gently standing in the wisp of sunlight, the young girl blinked her clear, glass-like beautiful eyes, while a wisp of an arc appeared on her red little mouth, causing the hearts of countless people to skip a beat.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen stared unblinkingly at the young girl that had caused no small amount of shock and astonishment in him. At this moment, Luo Li didn’t appear as cold and indifferent as before. Her tied up ponytail caused this young girl to display the youth and vitality that she was supposed to have. Such a beautiful scene appeared to have dimmed the sunlight.</p>
 <p>“Hey, what are you looking at?” Being stared by countless gazes, Luo Li’s beautiful face turned a shade of pink, especially after seeing the unblinking appearance of Mu Chen. Unable to bear it, she bit her lips, before blushingly speaking, while lowering her head to look at her outfit, “Is it ugly?”</p>
 <p>“My saliva is dripping out.”</p>
 <p>Wiping his mouth, Mu Chen walked towards the young girl. Extending his hand, he slightly bowed his body, before speaking with a grin, “My Queen, your knight’s waiting for you.”</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s the future Queen of the Luo God Clan. However, in Mu Chen’s heart, this girl was also his Queen.</p>
 <p>“Such a bold knight like you will be punished in our Luo God Clan,” replied Luo Li with a gentle smile. Nevertheless, despite what she was saying, she gently extended her slender little hand, lightly grasping onto the warm hand as an arc appeared on her lips.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Seeing the handsome, tall and straight youth and the absolutely perfect, young girl with a sweet smile, the members of the Luo Goddess Association instantly cheered out, their faces brimming with excitement. The young male and female before their eyes were the pride of their Luo Goddess Association.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Sending a faint smile towards Luo Li, with a move, Mu Chen and Luo Li transformed into rays of light, shooting off into the distance. Behind them, countless members of the Luo Goddess Association rose into the air, hiding the skies and covering the earth as they followed along.</p>
 <p>Within the central-most location of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, the skies and the ground were already covered by seas of humans. When Mu Chen and the group arrived, the seas of humans instantly split apart, creating a pathway for the dazzling young male and female to pass through.</p>
 <p>Within the sky filled by the sea of humans was an empty patch. Upon the arrival of the two, Mu Chen and Luo could see Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, Su Xuan and the others that have arrived earlier and were waiting for them, dressed similarly in academy uniforms. Standing tall and straight, with the ladies and their lovable appearances, the group had now become the most dazzling image within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>The appearance of Mu Chen and Luo Li had induced earth-shattering sounds of cheering. At this moment, they, who were representing the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to fight, were clearly the true heroes in everyone’s hearts and minds.</p>
 <p>“Sorry for being late.”</p>
 <p>Said Mu Chen as he sent a smile towards Shen Cangsheng and the others.</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng and the rest gave a smile in return, before turning their gazes, without prior agreement, towards Luo Li standing beside Mu Chen, which caused their eyes to slightly light up, even causing Su Xuan to feel slightly astonished. At this moment, the young girl truly appeared excessively eye-catching. The future Queen of the Luo God Clan seemed to have made all of her splendor blossom out.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Dean Tai Cang, as well as the five Heavenly Seated Elders and other Elders, with even Ling Xi, appeared in the sky. Looking towards the young males and females standing tall and straight in the air, Dean Tai Cang couldn’t help having a smile appear on his face. In the next moment, his face gradually turned solemn, while the fervent atmosphere within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy slowly started to quieten down.</p>
 <p>“Students, they are the most outstanding students of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. From today onwards, they will be stepping into a harsh and cruel battlefield to fight for the honor and glory of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. They are doing so to protect the pride of our academy in being one of the five Great Academies. Therefore, they are the heroes of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.”</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang’s powerful voice resounded across the entire region, causing the faces of countless students to turn red, the blood within their bodies surging and boiling as they looked, brimming with emotion at the ten figures standing in the skies.</p>
 <p>“Therefore, regardless of victory or defeat, they’re our heroes!”</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang gave a faint smile, before slowly bending his body towards the ten youthful figures standing in the sky. Behind him, faint smiles appeared on the faces of the various Elders as they slightly bent over, giving their blessing towards this group of youths that was going into battle for the sake of the glory and honor of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>An uniformed sound rang out across the entire region as countless students slowly bent over, their heads lower. The faces of those young and immature faces were filled with passion. Youths were supposed to be filled with hot blood. The scene occuring before them caused them to wish they could do their utmost to train and cultivate, hoping to be able to obtain such distinction one day in the future.</p>
 <p>In the air, as they took in the scene before them, hot blood surged and gushed within the hearts of Mu Chen, Shen Cangsheng and the group. Sending a smile towards one another, they slowly bent over towards the countless students before them.</p>
 <p>“It’s time to group up,” said Dean Tai Cang with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>With a gentle wave of their hands, figures started to converge behind the backs of Mu Chen and Shen Cangsheng. Standing naturally behind Mu Chen’s back was Luo Li, Xu Huang, Zhao Qingshan, as well as Mu Fengyang; while Li Xuantong, Su Xuan, He Yao and Yang Lin stood behind Shen Cangsheng.</p>
 <p>These two groups represented the greatest strength of this current batch of students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>“Prepare the transmission Spiritual Array.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the roar of Dean Tai Cang, Lin Xi strode forward. With a raise of her hand, a thousand metre wide glowing pillar descended from the sky. Rays of Spiritual Energy light gushed out from within the glowing pillar, while a gigantic transmission Spiritual Array could be faintly discerned as it formed, with boundless Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiating from within.</p>
 <p>After arranging the Spiritual Array, Ling Xi walked towards Mu Chen. Sending a faint smile towards Mu Chen and Luo Li, she softly said, “Be careful.”</p>
 <p>“Please be at ease, Elder Sister Ling Xi.” replied Mu Chen with a smile as he nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Ling Xi looked towards the handsome youth before her, That handsome face, those clear and bright eyes, that ramrod straight back. Unknowingly, he had captured God-knows how many affections of young girls. This caused her to shake her head, before speaking out, “The transmission Spiritual Array has already been arranged. Prepare to make your move.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Mu Chen took a deep breath, before fiercely nodding his head.</p>
 <p>Shooting a look at Mu Chen, Shen Cangsheng took the lead, walking forward, before he said with a smile, “Mu Chen, we’ll take the lead first. Let’s meet in the great Tournament! I hope that we’ll both be able to enter the final fight!”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>As he said those words, Shen Cangsheng gave a wave of his hand. A prideful and disdainful look surfaced on his firm and resolute face. Shooting forward, he took the lead, bringing along Li Xuantong and the others of his group as they shot across the horizon. Finally, under the countless emotional and excited gazes, they rushed into the gigantic transmission Spiritual Array. As rays of brilliance gushed out, their figures completely disappeared within it.</p>
 <p>“It’s time for us to go, too!”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen gave a low roar, causing the eyes of Luo Li, Xu Huang, Zhao Qingshan and Mu Fengyang to contract. The five quickly shot out, rapidly following behind Shen Cangsheng and the other four as they rushed into the transmission Spiritual Array.</p>
 <p>At this instant, the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had completely entered a fervent and frenzied state.</p>
 <p>Looking at the frenzied Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Dean Tai Cang deeply exhaled. Looking towards the gradually disappearing transmission Spiritual Array, he muttered, “It’s up to you guys, now. I hope that we’ll be able to see the groups of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy before the start of the final fight…”</p>
