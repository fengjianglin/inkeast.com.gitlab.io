Black lightning light sparkled within it, appearing akin to a black lightning dragon coiling its gigantic body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectacle before their eyes had undoubtedly caused everyone’s expressions to violently contort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even Zhen Qing was overwhelmed in shock as he looked towards the black storm clouds in the air. The might of the heavens and earth radiating from them had caused the Spiritual Energies within everyone to show signs of shivering. This made them understand that the lightning energies present within this storm cloud wasn’t as simple as being composed from Spiritual Energy. Those were lightning energies genuinely born from the heavens and earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This brilliance coming from the might of the heavens and earth was something that people of their level would absolutely not be able to summon forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s handsome face was covered with a solemn expression as his slender fingers hastily trembled, while faint rays of lightning brilliance sparkled at his fingertips. This was the first time he had genuinely executed the “Lightning Controlling Technique” ever since he learned it from the Northern Sea Dragon. Generally speaking, Divine Techniques were exceedingly hard to cultivate. What’s more, this Lightning Controlling Technique was considerably extraordinary. Even after multiple months of analysing and learning, Mu Chen had only grasped a few straws of comprehension in it. However, he fortunately possessed an advantage that ordinary people did not have, which was that he had cultivated his Lightning God’s Physique. Having experienced the tempering from so many bolts of Divine Black Lightning, he was able to feel some familiar responses from the lightning energies of the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was actually because he was relying on this that he became able to display the “Lightning Controlling Technique” at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black storm clouds surged and churned as the black lightning energies rapidly condensed, faintly revealing their extraordinary prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath them, nine beams of light formed by those nine stars subsequently arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

In the next instant, cracks of thunder that caused people’s scalps to turn numb rumbled across the entire giant hall. Immediately, the giant hall started to shake akin to suffering an earthquake. In fact, the Spiritual Energy present in the world started to disperse apart in succession, appearing to be unable to withstand the might of the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone raised their heads.</span></p>

Akin to a lightning dragon baring its fangs and claws, it descended down, with thunderous rumbles howling out as it travelled. As it did so, a long fissure was even carved through space, leaving being a singed smell in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black lightning bolt pierced through the world with seemingly nothing being able to obstruct it. This was a power that destroyed anything in its path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this bolt of lightning wasn’t as terrifying as the Divine Black Lightning that had appeared during Nine Nether’s tribulation then, the destructive fluctuations radiating from it were sufficient to cause people to feel extremely terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the black bolt of lightning descended, lightning light illuminated the entire giant hall, lighting up Xia Hou’s face at the same time. At this moment, the latter’s face appeared chilly and malevolent, clearly appearing exceedingly terrifyied under the lightning light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Travelling at an exceedingly fast speed, the black bolt of lightning seemingly took only a flash to pierce through space. In the end, under the attentive gazes coming from the surroundings, it violently smashed against the nine star-transformed beams of light before they could smash into Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant when the two attacks collided, eye-piercing lightning brilliance radiated out, causing everyone’s eyes to narrow in pain. In the next moment, all of them felt an indescribably rampant shock wave spreading across the giant hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!</span></p>

Regardless of the special materials used in its construction, the group was still unable to withstand the exceedingly rampant lightning shock waves. In fact, the giant pillars close to the epicentre of the impact had fissures all over their collapsed surfaces. At this moment, those vines that had pervaded the entire giant hall were turned into dust in the light of the lightning light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such frighteningly destructive power caused everyone present within in the giant hall to become completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crackle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the epicentre of the shock wave, two frightening energies crazily corroded one another. However, as the black lightning light sparkled, it had clearly gotten the upper hand. The overbearingness of the Divine Black Lightning wasn’t something that could be easily blocked. After all, even Nine Nether then had nearly failed to pass her Divine Tribulation twice due to the Divine Black Lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Divine Black Lightning Mu Chen had summoned was unable to be compared with the one faced by Nine Nether in her tribulation, the disparity between Xia Hou and Nine Nether was similarly too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking towards the lightning energies that had gained the upper hand, Xia Hou’s face grew ashen. Staring malevolently towards Mu Chen, he immediately changed his hand seal and explosively roared, “Nine Stars Explosion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following his explosive roar, the Nine Stars seemed to explode apart at the same time, causing frightening energies to instantly sweep out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as this energy shock wave was radiating out, chilling rays of brilliance gushed from within Mu Chen’s black pupils as he extended his slender finger and gave a gentle point towards the space before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nothing fanciful, just a single word. Yet, it brimmed with incomparable overbearingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a single word, the Divine Black Lightning instantly flared as the black lightning light crazily sparkled, rushing like a furious dragon in the end. As the lightning light shot out, the frightening energies from the explosion of the nine stars were unexpectedly destroyed and annihilated</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible?!” Xia Hou’s face instantly turned deathly pale as he howled in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the Divine Black Lightning had gained the upper hand and had suppressed its contender!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

In the next instant, everyone present in the giant hall saw the Divine Black Lightning drown out the nine stars. Transforming into a beam of lightning, it shattered space apart before enveloping Xia Hou in an unavoidable stance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, emotions of fear and dread gushed from the latter’s eyes as he felt the flavor of death coming from the black bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I admit defeat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shouted in shock and terror, with his voice becoming much more shrill and ear-piercing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, faced against his cry, a shade of indifference still hung on Mu Chen’s face. Clearly, he would not show any type of excessive clemency in such moments. He had summoned forth his strength to the fullest to display the Lightning Controlling Technique, which resulted in a gargantuan consumption of his strength. If he was to get nothing in return, he would be extremely hard-pressed to find another good opportunity like this to deal with Xia Hou; after all, the latter wasn’t a helpless kitten. With his cultivation at Spiritual Energy Disaster, he was more than sufficient to bring trouble to Mu Chen in the future, if he's not dealt with now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

With a thought, the bolt of Divine Black Lightning struck Xia Hou’s body without the slightest bit of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

In the next instant, the Spiritual Energy defenses around Xia Hou’s body completely collapsed, before being miserably shot backwards like a kite with broken strings. As blood spurted from him, his body drew a thousand metre long gulch within the giant hall, before slamming against a giant pillar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

As stone pieces pressed down on his body, suffocating him, his aura grew increasingly weaker. Clearly, he was sent to a point close to death by the severe injuries he had sustained…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rumbling noises in the giant hall gradually came to a stop.</span></p>

Who would have guessed that Xia Hou, who had gained the absolute superiority earlier would… actually become like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of Tang Mei’er, Zhou Yuan and the rest were wide open as they vacantly looked towards the scene before them. In the next moment, after slightly turning their gazes with bated breath, they looked towards the body of the youth who appeared slightly pale.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had actually… defeated Xia Hou…</span></p>

At this moment, they were finally able to completely understand why Mu Chen was able to become the Captain of this group from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, with even someone as strong as Luo Li not showing any dissent about this. It turned out that this youth, whose strength appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary, had actually possessed such frightening combat prowess that caused people to be filled with horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this universe, there was no lacking of people that were able to fight above their cultivation realms. However, there were some that were undeniably freaks amongst those geniuses. After seeing the spectacle that had unfolded before them, this Mu Chen might be a member of that league.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Tang Mei’er and the rest were sighing in incomparable admiration, all colour was drained from the faces of the group from the Saint Spiritual Academy as they inconceivably looked at Xia Hou, who had fainted due to his severe injuries. They were still somewhat unable to believe the brutal reality that had unfolded before their very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shadows of darkness and uncertainty loomed within Zhen Qing’s eyes as he looked towards the defeated Xia Hou. Looking towards Mu Chen’s figure, there were thick feelings of dread, fear and caution surfacing within his eyes. At this moment, he finally started to treat Mu Chen as an opponent that was genuinely able to pose a threat to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, on the contrary, Mu Chen didn’t give any care towards all of the gazes that had converged on him. Covering his mouth to give a cough, a shade of paleness surfaced on his handsome face. In the end, being a Divine Technique, although the Lightning Controlling Technique possessed extreme might and power, it also possessed extreme consumption of his energy. According to Mu Chen’s estimates, he would be extremely hard-pressed to activate it one more time…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a move could only be properly displayed by Sovereign realm experts, yet it was executed by him today. Truly, the might it possessed didn’t disappoint him.</span></p>

As shattered rocks started to fly up, a ray of brilliance shot from Xia Hou’s chest, before landing in Mu Chen’s hand. This was the Academy Plaque of the Saint Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shooting a glance at the Academy Plaque, Mu Chen’s eyebrows instantly jumped as there was actually 4200 points on this Academy Plaque! Furthermore, they were ranked at 7th place on the rankings listed on it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This amount seemed to be two to three times more than the points Mu Chen had.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As rays of brilliance shone, the number present on Mu Chen’s Academy Plaque instantly rose to 3007.</span></p>

In the next moment, a new group bounded over one group after another at an astonishing speed, before finally coming to a stop at the ninth place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great Spiritual Academy Tournament.

This way, news about himself would be discovered by all of the groups, with Ji Xuan being amongst them.</span></p>
