Especially when the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was discovered, this vast land practically became the most popular place in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And this time, at the opening of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, the population on this land had also reached a terrifying height. There were endless whizzings of wind that resounded in the sky within hundreds of thousands of kilometres in radius. Figures were streaking across the horizon from every direction like locusts heading towards the Dragon-Phoenix Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The name of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was too famous in the Northern Region and anyone that could be considered as a genius amongst the younger generation would not let go of this chance so easily. Naturally, the important point was naturally the attractiveness of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and Cai Xiao reached the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, they were just in time to witness the spectacular locust-like scene. Those shocking numbers left even Mu Chen a little dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those figures weren’t your ordinary goons, they’re from various forces and they were naturally the top amongst the younger generations in their forces. But upon reaching here, no matter how dazzling they were, they would all be covered up by this terrifying amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had exclaimed in astonishment. He had met some geniuses of the younger generation in the Northern Heavens Continent. But be it the quantity or quality, they were far in comparison to the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this place was a true gathering of heroes in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After reaching here, Mu Chen understood how vast the Northern Region was. Even the Great Havenlaw Domain was just a corner of it. Furthermore, the Northern Region was merely a corner of the Skylaw Continent, as well. This continent was truly worthy of the name supercontinent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s head to the Dragon-Phoenix Ancient City first. It’s the closest place to the opening of the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.” Mu Chen pointed towards the depths of the Dragon-Phoenix Mountain Range. In the distant place, he could vaguely see the astonishing outline of a majestic city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao curiously looked around, before she casually nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response to her agreement, Mu Chen flew out first. Roughly ten minutes later, he slowed down his speed and directed his gaze, which was filled with slight shock, up ahead. He saw numerous majestic mountains that seemed to be forcefully squeezed together by a powerful force. Vaguely, giant handprints could be seen on those mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On top of those mountains was a majestic ancient city and the end of it could not be seen. The city was filled with signs of leaving behind by times, emitting an ancient and desolate aura that enveloped this entire region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the edge of the city, there were numerous stone pagodas with heights reaching ten thousand feet. Faint remnants of Spiritual Energy fluctuations could still be felt from those pagodas, which Mu Chen wasn’t a stranger to. They were the fluctuations of Spiritual Arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that ancient time, this must definitely have been a stunningly powerful Spiritual Array. But as time went by, the powerful Spiritual Array that could once show disdain for the sky had been obliterated under the years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majestic aura of this city made others feel astonished. Even in the sky, there was an endless flow of light figures that flew towards the ancient city like locusts. However, the city was not congested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Cai Xiao had also flown into the city, before landing on an ancient limestone street that was filled with people. The moment they appeared, there were countless heated gazes from the surroundings being shot over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the target of those gazes was Cai Xiao, who had come with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cao Xiao was long accustomed to those gazes at this moment, so she could basically, naturally ignore them. In contrast, Mu Chen felt a little helpless. As those gazes fell onto Cai Xiao, they were also directed at him, as expected, and the hostility in their gazes couldn’t be concealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A source of calamity…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could only sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao glared at him in annoyance as the smear of a bewitching allure between her brows made even Mu Chen’s heart jolt, not to mention those gazes coming from the surroundings, which were a little blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, before those gazes became more heated, Mu Chen immediately left with Cai Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although having Cai Xiao around would attract too much attention, it was also extremely easy for them to get information with her around. She only had to ask a random person with her smile and the latter would spit out all the information they knew in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go take a look at the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing another unfortunate fellow that was charmed into a daze by Cai Xiao, he looked towards the north. According to the information that Cai Xiao had previously obtained, there seemed to be a Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion in this Dragon-Phoenix Ancient City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every last bit of information regarding the Dragon-Phoenix Haven was originating from there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them walked in the bustling ancient city, before they halted their steps at the northern side of the ancient city. Raising their heads, they saw a yellow pavilion quietly towering before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pavilion had an unique appearance, decorated with Dragons and Phoenixes. Vaguely, there were oppressive auras that belonged to genuine Dragons and Phoenixes emitting from it. Even at this moment, there were many figures that were flying towards this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on his senses, Mu Chen could sense that those people that were coming in this direction were stronger than those in the other places in this ancient city. Clearly, the majority of those that were qualified to come were the elites of the Northern Region. Furthermore, those that weren’t strong enough naturally did not dare to step in to avoid courting humiliation, embarrassing themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen did not stop his steps because of this reason. He looked at the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion and directly entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Entering the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion, the sight before him instantly widened as the noise had also entered his ears. Raising his gaze and looking forth, he saw numerous levels that were irregularly exquisitely arranged, each flooring was filled with people that possessed powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations. As for those higher levels, there were shocking, fearful Spiritual Energy pressures emanating from those floors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen and Cai Xiao entered the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion, the noise from the floors had distinctively weakened and many breathtaking gazes were directed at Cai Xiao, who was beside Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen maintained a calm expression as he sought a corner and quietly sat down with Cai Xiao. According to the information that they had previously obtained, there seemed to be someone in charge of distributing information in this Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion, and all they had to do was wait here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, Mu Chen wanted to obtain information peacefully. But with a lamplight like Cai Xiao around, he knew that at this moment, he had already become the target of attention from countless experts of the younger generation. There might even be someone that had started to investigate his identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And as Mu Chen had expected, there was a familiar gaze that immediately shot over from the upper levels with a chill in it the moment he entered the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan sat on the upper levels and was looking at Mu Chen’s direction with a calm gaze, before sweeping his gaze towards Cai Xiao, who was beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area where Liu Yan was at was surrounded by numerous figures, just like a considerably sized circle. Everyone in this circle wasn’t nameless amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region. Each and every one of them had a decent reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, this circle was clearly circled around two figures, with one of them being Liu Yan. However, he clearly wasn’t the main spotlight here, since beside him sat a slender and beautiful figure that attracted countless heated gazes in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This figure was dressed in a fiery-red long skirt. She had skin that was as fair as snow. Under her dress, were delicate and ample outlines that would cause the blood of others to rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a gorgeous appearance, curvy brows and watery, slender eyes that were filled with a bewitching charm. The movements of her eyelids alone could cause the heart of others to go out of control. In the surroundings, who knows how many younger generation experts were there that seemed like gentlemen on the surface but were blazing with heat in the depth of their eyes. Their looks were as if they couldn’t help wishing to devour her into their stomachs.</span></p>

Since when is there such an outstanding talent in the Northern Region that I am unaware of?”</span></p>

They instantly understood the relationship between the both of them. Several experts who had a somewhat good relationship with Liu Yan smiled as they looked down at Mu Chen with ridicule.</span></p>

Although the Great Havenlaw Domain is a peak force in the Northern Region, the younger generations nurtured by them aren’t worth praising. All these years, they did not have anything to do with the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, so why did they remember it suddenly this time? Can it be that they have not embarrassed themselves enough?” An expert who had a pretty good relationship with Liu Yan smiled as his tone was filled with aggressiveness.</span></p>

On the contrary, he had intentionally wrapped his voice with a little Spiritual Energy and sent it down from high up. Instantly, it caused the Dragon-Phoenix Haven to become a little quiet as countless show-watchers looked towards the youth who was seated in the corner.</span></p>

His handsome face was rather calm at this moment.</span></p>

He had only revealed a faint smile, before barely nodding his head at the person who spoke out.</span></p>
