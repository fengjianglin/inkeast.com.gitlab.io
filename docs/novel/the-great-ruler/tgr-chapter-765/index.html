 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, faint ripples rose in his somewhat calm heart as Mu Chen looked at the Great Havenlaw Army, which was completely bowing with respect. After all, it was the Great Havenlaw Army before him, the strongest troop within the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Nine Nether Troop had pretty decent potential, the Nine Nether Troop wouldn’t last a few minutes if both of the troops were to fight. After all, everyone in the Great Havenlaw Army had stepped into the Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the might of this army was unleashed, probably aside from the Three Emperors, none of the Kings could fight them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the Great Havenlaw Army was so powerful, it definitely wasn’t easy to become their Commander. As for the fact that he managed to get through the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array, he knew that the Great Havenlaw Army had probably not fully accepted him within their hearts. After all, his strength was too weak compared to the other Commanders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen wasn’t unhappy about this. Although there was some distance between him and the five Commanders, there would be a day when no one would dare to look at him in contempt as long as there’s enough time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly descended from the sky and landed at the area where Mandala and the rest were at. He waved his hand and a jade bottle appeared in his hand, with two different colours of Spiritual Energy flowing within. Wrapped by the Spiritual Energies were nine drops of blood essence that seemed like magma. An extremely blazing fluctuation was emanating from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re all mine?” Mu Chen smiled as he looked at Mandala.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was naturally drooling over the Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essence as the Primordial Fire Dragon was ranked within the top ranks of powerful Divine Beasts, whose strengths weren’t any weaker than the Northern Sea Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Mu Chen spent so much effort and only managed to get a drop of the Northern Sea Dragon’s Blood Essence. But right now, he had obtained nine drops, so he was naturally especially happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala indifferently nodded her head. Although the Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences were precious, they weren’t much in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you have gotten through the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array, then the only quota for the Dragon-Phoenix Haven will be given to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala then cast a glance a Mu Chen before saying, “The Dragon-Phoenix Haven can be considered as a grand occasion amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region. Every single one of those fellows possesses monstrous talents accompanied with powerful backings. Their strengths aren’t comparable to what you have encountered so far.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. He would naturally not underestimate those blessed geniuses that were nurtured by resources from the various forces. Although he had yet to encounter someone else, just Liu Yan of the Sky Profound Palace was enough to make him feel threatened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s a restriction in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven and none of us can enter. So at that time, you can only depend on yourself. If you get yourself killed there, then you can only blame yourself for being incapable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Has anyone from our Great Havenlaw Domain taken part in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven in the past?” Mu Chen asked after some thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There has, but they have all been killed by the representative of the Netherworld Palace.” Mandala’s face was a little unsightly. The Great Havenlaw Domain must have suffered quite a bit of ridicule from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the past, there’s a slight difference between the younger generation of our Great Havenlaw Domain compared to the other peak forces. Haha, furthermore, Lord Ruler didn’t seem to be too interested in it as well,” said the Sky Vulture Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who has that much time to slowly nurture those young fellows? I can slap those so-called blessed geniuses to death with one hand, why bother nurturing them? As long as I exist, the Great Havenlaw Domain will still stand. And if I am no longer around, it’s useless, no matter how many of those blessed geniuses you might have.” Mandala’s golden pupils stared at the Sky Vulture Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help grinning, but she clearly did not mean what she said. The reason why she did not intend to nurture any of the younger generations was probably that there wasn’t one that she was satisfied with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then again, what she said was right, as well. The reason why the Great Havenlaw Domain could stand in line as a peak force was because of her, a powerful Earth Sovereign expert’s existence. As long as she existed, no one would lightly place their ideas on the Great Havenlaw Domain. And if she’s no longer here, no matter how many formidable younger generations were there, they could not hold the Great Havenlaw Domain up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I hope that Mu Chen can have a more brilliant performance in this Dragon-Phoenix Haven to let others in the Northern Region know that our Great Havenlaw Domain also has a formidable younger generation this time,” said the Sky Vulture Emperor as he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. “I will do my best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he knew that everyone that would participate in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven were all geniuses, he felt no fear of them. They might be powerful, but he was not simple as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he didn’t have even this little bit of confidence in himself, then he wouldn’t have come this far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s good if you can obtain a good performance, but don’t get killed by those nameless fellows and become the stepping stone for others and even embarrass our Great Havenlaw Domain.” Mandala said as she splashed cold water over Mu Chen’s pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help to refuting with his teeth clenched, “Which other Ruler acts like you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of everyone trembled when they heard his words. In the Great Havenlaw Domain, Mandala was a dictatorship ruler to begin with and no one dared to go against her words. Although she might have a cute little girl appearance right now, no one dared to be less respectful just because of her appearance. Thus, when they heard Mu Chen speaking to Mandala this way, they were a little dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were feeling nervous, Mandala, however, did not get angry. On the contrary, her lips were raised in ridicule as she turned around and leisurely walked away with her hands behind her back, while her tender voice resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Follow me, there’s still five days till the Dragon-Phoenix Haven starts. I will give you some things, in case you say that I am not taking good care of my subordinates.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned upon hearing her words, before he waved his hand and swiftly followed after Mandala.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the two of them left, the Sky Vulture Emperor and the rest exchanged a look as they bitterly smiled. They could not figure out the relationship between Mu Chen and Mandala, but the two of them didn’t seem like a superior and subordinate from the way they conversed. Otherwise, with Mandala’s usual cold demeanor, Mu Chen would have been reduced to dust with a flick of her finger if he dared to speak to her in this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether also shrugged her shoulders as she smiled. She was naturally happy that Mandala would take such good care of Mu Chen. The reason why she brought Mu Chen over to the Great Havenlaw Domain was so that he could have a better cultivation condition. Although she had no idea how Mu Chen was able to have such a close relationship with Mandala, it wasn’t a bad thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen followed Mandala as they streaked across the Greatlaw Sky, before descending down at a mountain peak in the depths of the mountain range. Standing on the mountain peak was a simple-designed Book Depository Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Landing before the Book Depository Pavilion, Mu Chen’s body immediately tensed up in reflex as he swept his gaze over. Because in that direction, he sensed traces of dangerous fluctuations that invaded into his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Book Depository Pavilion of my Great Havenlaw Domain. Divine Arts, Spiritual Arrays and inheritances that we have raided from sects and clans are all stored here. This can be considered as the important ground of our Great Havenlaw Domain. In addition, this is also the place that Xiao Meng secludes himself.” Mandala casually said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Meng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was briefly stunned, before he immediately realised that she seemed to be talking about the Sleeping Emperor. Immediately, the corner of his lips involuntarily twitched. The head of the Three Emperors was actually addressed in such a funny way by Mandala?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So this is the place that the Sleeping Emperor guards.” Mu Chen’s body gradually relaxed. It was no wonder why he sensed such intense danger earlier. With such an expert guarding this place, it was simply impossible for ordinary people to come close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although you have broken through, you’re still just a Third Grade Sovereign. There’s still a considerable gap between you and those geniuses. It’s said that Liu Yan of the Sky Profound Palace has long stepped into the Fourth Grade Sovereign Realm. Compared to that Qin Bei that you have defeated, he’s much stronger.” Mandala’s tender voice resounded before the Book Depository Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, you have crippled Liu Ming and this Liu Yan has declared that he will definitely deal with you in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. Liu Yan was indeed a formidable character that someone like Qin Bei couldn’t be compared to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala waved her hand and the door of the Book Depository Pavilion slowly opened. In an instant, a shocking fluctuation swept out but they could not even lift the skirt of Mandala, who stood before the gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala directly walked in, with Mu Chen closely following behind. Entering the pavilion, colourful glitters instantly filled his eyes. There were numerous stone platforms filled halos that had floating scrolls within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those scrolls were emitting powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations. Clearly, they weren’t simple stuff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling collective lineup left Mu Chen dumbfounded. He even couldn’t help smacking his lips. This was the wealth of a peak force, god-knows how many unfortunate sects have been raided after all these years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala did not get Mu Chen to choose. Instead, she made a clawing gesture. A streak of light flew over and entered her hand, which she threw over to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’re going to participate in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, then you should know your competitors. The geniuses of the Northern Region’s younger generations are all recorded here. You can take a look so that you can make proper preparations if you encounter them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mandala’s words, Mu Chen’s heart shook and he immediately received the streak of light. As the light dissipated, a scroll was revealed before him. On the two sides of the scroll were a dragon and phoenix tangled together, vaguely issuing a draconic roar and phoenix cry, which clearly rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly opened it and golden light immediately circulated. What first appeared before his eyes were three golden flamboyant words.</span></p>
