In the depths of the cave, there was an intense suction force that emanated from it that sucked in those strands of azure smoke, as if it had formed a vortex of azure smoke…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the centre of the vortex, Mu Chen’s figure was quietly seated like a boulder. His current body was like a bottomless abyss that endlessly devoured that azure smoke into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poof! Poof!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen remained unmoving, even when his clothes had been reduced to ashes without any changes in his expression. That’s because he had entered into a deep state of cultivation. Furthermore, he had already emptied his mind, allowing him to be in a self-forgetting state of cultivation. He had been constantly attempting to visualise the lightning prison under that empty state…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

Darkness had endlessly spread out in his mind and the violent thunderous roars violently echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sizzle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unsure of how many failures he made, Mu Chen finally had some scale of visualising the lightning prison. Although it was still not successful, the lightning prison had gradually taken shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the lightning prison already had a shape, Mu Chen only needed to thoroughly perfect it… since the lightning prison was already formed, he just had to refine his will with lightning in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mu Chen’s will revolved, the thunderclouds in the dark lightning prison suddenly rolled and the thunderclouds started to swiftly rub against one another. The friction from the thunderclouds had caused a thunderous roar to erupt. As if there was something brewing in the thunderclouds…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thunderous roar turned even more violent, then a huge noise rang out. The thunderclouds were torn apart and a bolt of lightning that was roughly a few dozen feet in thickness rumbled as it constantly spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That lightning was naturally the Nether Demon Heart Lightning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only one attempt and Mu Chen had successfully visualised the Nether Demon Heart Lightning. Clearly, it was due to him refining the Nether Demon Heart Lightning. After all, if one wanted to draw a tiger, one would have to look at a tiger first. If one didn’t even know the appearance of a tiger, then it was naturally impossible to draw it. It was the same for visualisation as well, if Mu Chen had not seen the Nether Demon Heart Lightning and experience its characteristics, he wouldn’t have been able to visualise the actual Nether Demon Heart Lightning and obtain the effect of refining his will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was just one bolt of Nether Demon Heart Lightning. It was clearly impossible to activate the lightning prison with just a single bolt. Mu Chen still had to visualise more Nether Demon Heart Lightning to fill up the lightning prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a target, Mu Chen did not dally and started to visualise again. Instantly, violent thunderous roars resounded in the dark lightning prison once again. As the thunderclouds rubbed against each other, one incorporeal lightning after another started to appear…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was naturally a considerable work to fill up the lightning prison, and the time it took wouldn’t be short. Therefore, Mu Chen had gone into a dry and dull process of visualising the Nether Demon Heart Lightning…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had expelled all other thoughts in his mind, focusing to visualise the Nether Demon Heart Lightning. When his will was exhausted, he would stop and meditate to recover. When he recovered, he would start visualising again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had lost the concept of time and had no idea how much time had passed. He only knew that he had to continue visualising until the lightning prison was thoroughly shaped in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the concept of time, he had already entirely forgotten about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time seemed to have frozen. Mu Chen had no idea how many times he had gone into meditation to recover his will. Perhaps he had done it for a thousand times or even more…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was someone without a firm heart doing the visualisation, they would have already gone insane. But due to the years of his bitter cultivation, it was effective at this crucial moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His perseverance had forced him to hold onto the dry and dull process, his endurance had also been repaid, since the lightning prison was getting filled up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scale in the dark lightning prison was indescribable as the thunderclouds filled it. Formless Nether Demon Heart Lightning whistled through the sky. That scene was similar to Judgement Day. If this scene was to appear in the outside world, probably anyone beneath the cultivation of Earth Sovereign Realm wouldn’t dare to casually enter it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time of visualisation, the lightning prison had finally been formed and it was displaying how violent and ferocious it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s will wandered in the lightning prison and he could feel that with a will of his intent, the Nether Demon Heart Lightning in the lightning prison would launch attacks at his will, refining it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had finally accomplished the most crucial step of cultivating the Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique. Naturally, the next step was also very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because Mu Chen had to maintain this lightning prison. Otherwise, if his will exited this place, then the lightning prison would disappear, and if he wanted to cultivate, he would have to create the lightning prison all over again…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After experiencing how tough it was to create the lightning prison, Mu Chen understood that it was impossible. After all, he couldn’t afford to spend such a huge amount of energy and time to create the lightning prison all over again every single time he cultivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he had to complete the most crucial step, to stabilise the lightning prison in his mind. And according to the Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique, it was known as Prisonization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It actually wasn’t too difficult to achieve this step, since this lightning prison was born from Mu Chen’s will. Therefore, as long as his will could remain here, then the lightning prison wouldn’t disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen’s will had to return to his body and could not remain here. If that’s the case, then his body would die… and the solution of this wasn’t too hard. As long as he separated a portion of his own will to remain here, the existence of the lightning prison would be maintained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that was an ordinary method, whereas the Nine Lightning Tribulation Visualisation Technique had a unique method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Which was the Will Seed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Separating nearly half of his will into a seed to stay in the lightning prison. But generally speaking, it was an extremely perverse method, since his will would be weakened by this method. Furthermore, the Will Seed required him to separate half of his will, so how much would his own will be weakened to?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if it was a perverse method, it was also extremely brilliant at the same time. The Will Seed left in the lightning prison could be refined by the lightning prison at all times. That also meant that even if the other half of Mu Chen’s will didn’t enter into the lightning prison, the Will Seed that he had left behind would also be refined and become stronger…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking down the road, it was definitely an extremely profitable investment, it just that he needed the courage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But clearly, Mu Chen wasn’t lacking courage. Therefore, he had split his will in half without any hesitation!</span></p>

In the next instant, it was a little tough for Mu Chen to maintain this state, since his will was nearly blown out of his mind. But fortunately, his perseverance was pretty good, so he had managed to hold on throughout the intense tearing pain, avoiding a scenario where his previous efforts were all in vain.</span></p>

Along with every single bombardment of the lightning, he could see that lump of will becoming more refined. After god-knows how many times of refining, the other half of his will had vaguely formed into a thumb-sized shapeless lump.</span></p>

When he opened his eyes, many bits of information that had been blocked out by him gushed forth at this moment when his will had gained control of his body once again.</span></p>
