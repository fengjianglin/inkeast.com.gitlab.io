 <p><strong>Chapter 286 - (Hidden Title)</strong></p>
 <p>Up in the heavens, the black thunder clouds were rapidly gathering. The thunder clouds did not issue any thunderous sounds, but the pressure that it issued had caused the heavens and earth to freeze.</p>
 <p>Anyone could sense how terrifying the perishing storm would be after the silence.</p>
 <p>The Nine Netherbird flapped its wings as its black flames surged. In the depths of the black flames, fine purple flames fluctuated. Although they were small and hard to detect, they emitted a surge of mysterious power.</p>
 <p>On the grounds below, Mu Chen’s gaze turned extremely grave. Under that pressure, he could sense the Spiritual Energy within his body had stopped circulating. He was well aware that the next attack from the Divine Black Thunder Tribulation would be the last and if the Nine Netherbird could withstand it, then it would succeed its tribulation and shred its spiritual body, and evolve into a Divine Beast. By truly shredding itself from the category of a Spiritual Beast, and becoming the powerful Divine Beast that was comparable to Sovereigns, it would possess endless prospects as well.</p>
 <p>However, if it couldn’t withstand it, it would have failed. Although the Nine Netherbird possessed the bloodline of the Undying Bird, it couldn’t escape death every single time. The slightest mistake would cause it to be destroyed.</p>
 <p>Once the Nine Netherbird was destroyed, Mu Chen, who had a Bloodline bond with it would also suffer terrifying injuries, or even death.</p>
 <p>In this outcome, it would be extremely tragic for both Mu Chen and the Nine Netherbird.</p>
 <p>But at this timing, Mu Chen was also helpless. The Thunder Tribulation was too terrifying to the point that even a Sovereign wouldn’t dare to challenge it. Not to mention that he was just a puny Quasi-Heavenly Transformation Stage. Probably even if he had exerted all his means, it wouldn’t be able to shake it.</p>
 <p>“Nine Netherbird, go for it.” Mu Chen’s fists were clenched as he muttered.</p>
 <p>The suppressed atmosphere engulfed the heavens and earth. The black thunder clouds that had originally shrouded the heavens and earth of ten thousand feet had shrunk down to a hundred feet. But the colour was even more dense and, looking from afar, it was like a black hole that was slowly revolving.</p>
 <p>Onom.</p>
 <p>The black thunder clouds that were roughly a hundred feet in size suddenly wiggled. At the center, the thunder clouds were revolving and were caving in, bit by bit. At the center of the dent, the black-coloured lightning bolts were gathering together. The black-coloured lightning bolts seemed to be like sinister black dragons that were slowly wiggling about.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>At the center of the dent, a black-coloured lightning bolt abruptly shot out. It was like a black-coloured divine light that had pierced through the horizon. The destructive power spread and the area that was swept by the black-coloured light seemed to decompose Spiritual Energy…</p>
 <p>The entire heavens and earth were in silence as the black divine light roared as it shot down, like a deity that had been enraged.</p>
 <p>Liiii!</p>
 <p>The black flames were blazing within the eyes of the Nine Netherbird. It suddenly issued a cry and the flames that were compressed together shot up into the sky, and turned into a black-coloured feather that was roughly a thousand feet in size.</p>
 <p>On the feather, it looked as though profound runes were being carved on it. The black flames had ascended and were extremely abnormal.</p>
 <p>Facing that terrifying attack of the Divine Black Thunder Tribulation, the Nine Netherbird also exerted all of its power and lashed out with the most frightening move it had.</p>
 <p>Shhhhhhuu!</p>
 <p>As the black feather shot out, it pierced through the space and heavily clashed with the black-coloured divine light that had shot down from the heavens.</p>
 <p>At that instant, the two force clashed, even the light between the heavens and earth seemed to have been sucked in. Only a black-coloured light was spreading out in the sky and shrouded the area in a hundred mile radius.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>The mountains were being swept through and instantly turned into ashes, one after another. Looking from above, everything within a hundred miles was leveled to ground as each mountain range was being wiped out.</p>
 <p>Such destructive power had made those that were watching it feel a chill in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen did not have any startling thoughts as he fixed his eyes on the far horizon. A black light had gathered and was slowly pressing down. As it's pressure pressed down, fine cracks started to appear.</p>
 <p>The power of the Divine Black Thunder Tribulation was too powerful!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s heart jumped as his eyes shrank. As more and more cracks appeared on the black feather, it finally could not endure anymore and under the black-coloured divine light and a sharp sound, it shattered.</p>
 <p>As the black feather crumbled, the black light was unblockable and was whistling down under Mu Chen’s gaze. It attacked the enormous body of the Nine Netherbird.</p>
 <p>Liiiii!</p>
 <p>The cry that suddenly resounded was extremely sharp. The huge body of the Nine Netherbird rapidly fell and heavily landed on a mountain range far away.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>It felt like an earthquake had happened as a surging wave swept out. At the location that the Nine Netherbird had fallen, the surrounding range of ten thousand feet had instantly crumbled. Deep cracks were frantically spreading on the ground.</p>
 <p>The vast mountain range was also instantly destroyed!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen flew into the sky, and escaped that terrifying impact. He quickly rushed over and, at the center of the crater, the smoke was spreading and started to dissipate, bit by bit. The scene within was shown to Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>In the huge crater, the Nine Netherbird was lying down in a terrible state. The black-coloured feathers on it's body were destroyed and no longer had the gracefulness that it once had. Countless savage wounds were revealed on it's body as fresh blood flowed out, instantly dying the ground in red.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s gaze was fixed on the Nine Netherbird that was not moving in the blood pool. The Nine Netherbird’s face was pale and Mu Chen immediately landed at the location of the Nine Netherbird. He stuck his palm out, injecting his Spiritual Energy into the body of the Nine Netherbird.</p>
 <p>Under the injection of Spiritual Energy, the Nine Netherbird that was lying in the blood pool finally trembled. It managed to open it's eyes a little as a weak intent spread out, “I’ve managed to succeed?”</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen saw that the Nine Netherbird was still alive, only then did he feel relieved. He raised his head and his face abruptly changed. Up in the sky, the dissipating black thunder clouds were still flickering with a black light.</p>
 <p>There was still some remnant destructive ripples in it.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The black thunder clouds rumbled and a black lightning bolt shot down. However, that divine lightning bolt was clearly just a remnant energy and, compared to before, it was much weaker.</p>
 <p>At this point of time, the Nine Netherbird was already at the edge and could die at anytime. If that lightning bolt struck it right now, it would probably be dead!</p>
 <p>The Nine Netherbird seemed to have sensed this situation and immediately struggled up. However, it didn’t have any energy left nor blood to fill its body, and started to emit despair in its eyes.</p>
 <p>After working hard for so many years, was it all still in vain?</p>
 <p>Repeatedly fighting and, in the end, still failed?</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked at the despair in the Nine Netherbird’s eyes. He couldn’t help clenching his fist and, shortly after, with his teeth clenched, his figure moved. He appeared above the Nine Netherbird and with a bark, his handsigns changed. A Majestic Spiritual Energy gathered behind him and turned into a huge White Tiger. The White Tiger stood on the starry sky and ran, along with inexhaustible killing intent as it charged towards the last black lightning bolt.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Even with such a powerful attack, the instant it came in contact with the black lightning, it was only an instant before the black lightning tore the White Tiger apart.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The speed of the black lightning was fast as it had destroyed the White Tiger in just an instant and appeared above Mu Chen. Without the slightest leniency, it had struck Mu Chen’s body.</p>
 <p>The black lightning had sensed the similar ripples from the Nine Netherbird and, naturally, it wouldn’t let Mu Chen off.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen had been struck by the lightning bolt and a mouthful of blood spurted out. His body was covered by the violent lightning. Thereafter, he fell, landing not too far away from the Nine Netherbird and the ground beneath it had directly crumbled.</p>
 <p>Liii!</p>
 <p>When the Nine Netherbird saw the situation, it instantly issued a painful and low cry. Trembling as it stretched both of its wings that was filled with wounds, it tried to save Mu Chen, who was covered in black lightning.</p>
 <p>However, the Nine Netherbird’s wounds were too heavy. The instant it moved, intense pain spread out and had nearly submerged its last bit of consciousness.</p>
 <p>As the last lightning bolt landed, the black thunder clouds up in the sky had thoroughly dissipated. The instant the thunder clouds dissipated, the Nine Netherbird’s body instantly burst forth with dazzling light.</p>
 <p>That light was extremely bizarre as it shrouded the Nine Netherbird. Under the shining light, the terrible wounds on the Nine Netherbird were healed, little by little.</p>
 <p>“Has the tribulation finally succeeded?”</p>
 <p>The Nine Netherbird muttered to itself as its eyes were filled with emotions. It could sense that a huge change started to occur within its body.</p>
 <p>This was a genuine evolution.</p>
 <p>From body to bloodline!</p>
 <p>The evolution caused it to be extremely happy. However, it could see the figure that was shrouded with lightning not far away. Mu Chen’s strength was too weak and was impossible for him to bear the black lightning, even if it was just a remnant energy from the Divine Black Thunder Tribulation!</p>
 <p>However, when it was anxious, it saw that the figure that wasn’t far away had trembled. The black lightning on his body started to dissipate. He crawled up with great difficulty and with a bend, fresh blood uncontrollably spurt out from his mouth. He was on the verge of collapsing and clearly, he had suffered great injuries.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, I nearly died!”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s face was as pale as paper as he kneeled on the ground. He wiped the trace of blood at the corner of his mouth. Lowering his head, he looked at his palm as a smear of light flashed though his eyes and muttered, “It’s all thanks to this Thunder God Physique; otherwise, I would’ve died.”</p>
 <p>“Nine Netherbird!”</p>
 <p>As he muttered. He also sensed the dazzling light before him. He immediately raised his head and saw the huge body of the Nine Netherbird being covered by the divine light and started to shrink.</p>
 <p>The body turned smaller and smaller. In the end, it shrink into the light. Mu Chen narrowed his eyes from the brightness and he could not see the scene clearly.</p>
 <p>The light lasted for a long time, before it weakened down. As the light weakened, Mu Chen’s eyes also widened.</p>
 <p>Within the light, there was a jade-like naked body. Her figure was graceful and her pair of jade legs were slender and slim. Smooth and stretched taut, she was extremely sexy. On top of her jade legs, she was supporting a waist and on top of that, there was a snow-white neck that was similar to a swan’s.</p>
 <p>Her rosy lips lightly lifted, showing her charming faint purple eyes. With wildness that could make a man’s heart aroused.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was dumbfounded as he muttered, “…Sure enough it was a female.”</p>
