Beyond the gate was actually an entirely new scenery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heavens and earth were dyed in crimson with innumerable holes covering the ground that were filled with sinister-looking marks. Clearly, an intense battle must have taken place here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen entered this crimson region, his body had immediately tensed up and a golden-purple light flashed on his shoulder. The wound on his shoulder was swiftly healing and with his physique, which was comparable to Divine Beasts, such an injury practically posed no threat to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A vast Spiritual Energy undulated around Mu Chen as he looked in the surroundings with caution. When he arrived here, the colour of his face had drastically changed as he realised that on his right, space was also undulating as a slender silhouette came out from the distorted space and appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them faced each other and were stunning, before their faces immediately changed and they swiftly took several steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen?!” That silhouette had exclaimed, her face filled with shock. Clearly, the fact that Mu Chen was here had given her a severe shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. So it turns out to be Miss Zhantai.” After his initial shock, he swiftly calmed down as he looked at Zhantai Liuli with a smile-yet-not-a-smile expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhantai Liuli saw that smile on Mu Chen’s face, she had forced a smile as well. Her gaze flickered as she concealed the disbelief in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She clearly did not expect Mu Chen to get through the Four Spiritual Battle Formation at the same time as her, pass through that test and arrive here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did Mu Chen manage to defeat the Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit with five messy troops? How did he manage to accomplish it?!” Zhantai Liuli couldn’t help balling her fists as she bit on her rosy lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Looks like Miss Zhantai is very shocked at the fact that I’m here.” Mu Chen gaze Zhantai Liuli a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He tugged his arms towards his chest as he mockingly looked at Zhantai Liuli. The latter had clearly tricked all of them earlier, and if it wasn’t for Mu Chen taking a risk and forcefully combining five Battle Wills together, he wouldn’t have been able to get through the formation first. And if Zhantai Liuli managed to get ahead of them, then they would have been used by her in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Mu is capable, so there’s no surprise that you’re able to get through the Black Tortoise Battle Will Formation.” Zhantai Liuli took two steps back as she made a forceful smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not have her troops with her at the moment and her cultivation was just at Fourth Grade Sovereign. With that amount of strength, she was basically no threat to Mu Chen, who could defeat Fang Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without her Azure Troop, Zhantai Liuli practically has nothing that she could confront Mu Chen with. After all, she wasn’t diverse like Mu Chen, who was not only talented in Battle Wills, his own cultivation was also comparable to a genius like Fang Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhantai Liuli’s scheme was good indeed.” Mu Chen lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhantai Liuli heard his words, she bitterly smiled and blatantly said, “The Hunting War is targeted at each other, to begin with, and I believe that my Divine Pavilion and your Great Havenlaw Domain are enemies. So it should be expected for there to be scheming against each other, right? With King Mu’s wit, you have probably never believed in my words, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantia Liuli’s blunt speech had left Mu Chen someone unexpected as he squinted his eyes. “According to what you have said, you don’t have anything to say if I did anything to you here, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re enemies to begin with. Even if you kill me here, there’d be nothing surprising about it.” Zhantai Liuli said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” A cold light gathered in Mu Chen’s eyes with killing intent vaguely surging within. That’s because Zhantai Liuli was an extremely threatening existence. Don’t look at her being in Mu Chen’s hands now, if she had her Azure Troop, then even Mu Chen wasn’t confident that he could confront her, even with the five troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli slightly narrowed her eyes and she calmly said, “But, I believe that compared to killing me, the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor must be what you want the most. Due to some reason, I know more than you, so if you work together with me, we will have a bigger chance of obtaining the inheritance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cooperation? Do you think that I will believe in you now? If I kill you, then I believe there’s no one that would compete with me for the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor, right?” Mu Chen mocked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are too many expectations in the Death Ruin. I believe that with King Mu’s cautiousness, you don’t truly believe that you can easily obtain the inheritance of the Sky Formation Emperor, right? Although we have managed to get through the formation, who can guarantee that the real threat won’t appear?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli smiled and her gaze returned to being confident. She raised her face and looked at Mu Chen,. “According to the information that I know, King Mu is a person that is decisive in killing. If you had any intention in killing me, you would have acted by now instead of talking so much, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen narrowed his eyes as he calmly looked at Zhantai Liuli with a little shock in his heart. The calmness and wit of the latter had exceeded his expectations, but he agreed to her words. Just as she had said, there were too many precautions and uneasiness in this weird place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had made it through the formation, he still felt that this was the most dangerous location in the Death Ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Zhantai Liuli understood this place more than him and even she, herself, possessed some ability that could aid him. Therefore, he did not make a move the instant he saw her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want to cooperate, then take something out that I can believe in.” The chill in Mu Chen’s eyes gradually dissipated, but he still stared Zhantai Liuli in the eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli gently bit her rosy lips and had briefly hesitated, before speaking with a chilling gaze, “Your senses aren’t wrong. We won’t be able to obtain the inheritance after join getting through the formations. That’s because, according to the information I’ve received, this might be the most dangerous place in this Death Ruin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s face changed with his brows furrowed as he said in a solemn voice, “What do you mean by this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Four Spiritual Army isn’t the only thing being infected by the evil aura. Even the Sky Formation Emperor had suffered the invasion of evil aura from the Fiend clans in the great battle back then. So, the most dangerous place should be where the Sky Formation Emperor, who had been infected by the evil aura, is at.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli’s face had turned a little grave as she continued, “Because of the evil aura, the Sky Formation Emperor’s body has not been destroyed. If my guesses are correct, I’m afraid that he’s deep inside, waiting for us right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re saying that getting through the formation, we have entered into a death zone instead?” Mu Chen sneered. That’s because, according to Zhantai Liuli’s words, if the Sky Formation Emperor had been infected by the evil aura and lost his rationale, he wasn’t an existence that they could deal with. But, right now, despite knowing about it, Zhantai Liuli still chose to come in. Could it be that there was something wrong with her brain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since I chose to enter, there’s naturally an opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli understood Mu Chen’s doubts, so she faintly said, “Back then, when the Sky Formation Emperor suffered the invasion of the evil aura, he had made some preparations. He laid out a battle formation that could suppress the evil spirit in his body in the depths of this death ruin. Therefore, the evil spirit was unable to make use of his body to wreak havoc. As long as we can reach there, we will be able to thoroughly activate that battle formation to suppress the evil spirit in his body, restoring the little consciousness that’s left in the Sky Formation Emperor. At that time, we will be able to obtain his inheritance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Zhantai Liuli’s explanation, Mu Chen’s face unsteadily changed, since he could sense that Zhantai Liuli wasn’t lying this time. There was some truth held in her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, naturally, Mu Chen wouldn’t completely believe her because of this. After their multiple encounters, Mu Chen had understood that Zhantai Liuli was as sly as a fox.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do we activate that battle formation?” Mu Chen’s eyes flashed as he pointed out the most crucial matter.</span></p>

The method to activate the battle formation is written in the ancient text. So I am the only one that can activate it.” Zhantai Liuli said without any undulations in her tone.</span></p>

The latter was also looking at him without any fear. After looking for a long while, Mu Chen finally retracted his gaze and briefly pondered, before nodding his head. “Then we will do as you say. But I will say this beforehand: if I find anything amiss about you, I will immediately claim your life. Don’t think that you can fight me with that pathetic strength of yours. Without the Azure Troop, killing you is as easy as a flip of my hand!”</span></p>

Instead, she revealed a brilliant smile, before stretching her fair hand towards Mu Chen. “Then, let us have a wonderful cooperation.”</span></p>

The both of them had gone into cooperation once again, except that the trust between them was only known to the two of them.</span></p>
