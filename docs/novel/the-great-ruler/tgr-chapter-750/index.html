 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Expedition War between the Great Havenlaw Domain and Hundred Battles Domain ended with the former winning. When the battle came to an end, all information relating to it was swiftly spread out to the ears of the numerous forces that had cast their gazes over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speaking from a certain degree, the outcome of this battle wasn’t unexpected, since everyone knew that the Great Havenlaw Domain was more powerful than the Hundred Battles Domain. If it wasn’t for the Sky Profound Palace supporting the Hundred Battles Domain from the dark, they might not even dare to provoke the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the outcome of the war wasn’t unexpected, many forces felt somewhat unexpected because judging from the information that they had received, the Great Havenlaw Domain had been tricked by the Hundred Battles Domain in their battle. No one expected that the Spiritual Corpse King of the Demonic Corpse Sect would be so decisive and ruthless to explode his Demonic Corpse to greatly injure the Asura King and win a match for the Hundred Battles Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, the Great Havenlaw Domain had fallen into a disadvantage. After all, the cultivation of Qin Bei from the Hundred Battles Domain for the last match had far outstripped the new and unknown Commander of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when everyone thought in their hearts that Mu Chen would definitely lose the third match, it was flipped around and he won instead, which made everyone dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had thought that a young Commander with a cultivation of Second Grade Sovereign could flip the situation around at that moment and win the battle, defeating Qin Bei, who had half of his foot in the foothold of Fourth Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because of this unexpected match that flipped around the situation of the Great Havenlaw Domain, having them emerge victorious in the end. The outcome was clearly somewhat hilarious, since no one imagined that the battle which concerns the reputation of the Great Havenlaw Domain would fall onto the shoulders of a puny Commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, the ending, which concerned the confrontation between Mu Chen and Liu Yan, the Young Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace, had also been spread out, which caused some uproar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, that uproar was because a majority had thought of Mu Chen as an arrogant newcomer that was trying to use Liu Yan as a stepping stone. After all, Liu Yan’s reputation had already been spread open amongst the younger generation of the Northern Region and Mu Chen was still lacking right now. Even if he had defeated Qin Bei to build some reputation for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the difference between the two was too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter what others thought, at least the name that had been unfamiliar in the Northern Region was spread out. Many forces also knew that there was a new Commander called Mu Chen in the Great Havenlaw Domain with decent potential…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not know if this name would wither away under the geniuses of the Northern Region, but at least for now, he had started to bloom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would depend on whether he could convert his talent into his strength to see if his name would resound in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, many people would have their answer in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven that would take place shortly. Because Liu Yan of the Sky Profound Palace would definitely not let him off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the news of the war between the Great Havenlaw Domain and Hundred Battles Domain was spreading throughout the Northern Region, Nine Nether was enjoying the peace after the war in the Nine Nether Palace. Although the Nine Nether Palace was busy taking over a great amount of cities, those matters did not require Mu Chen and Nine Nether to worry about with the housekeeper, Tang Bing, around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, everyone in the Nine Nether Palace could feel that their position in the Great Havenlaw Domain had been continuously rising after the war. Those mockeries in the past had completely disappeared. It was so much so that even the Blood Hawk Hall, who did not find their Nine Nether Palace pleasing to the eyes, had been trying their best to avoid them and was no longer looking at them with the disdaining gazes from the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the reason for all the changes was clearly because of the Nine Nether Palace’s outstanding performance in the war. Naturally, the scene of the Great Havenlaw Ruler protecting Mu Chen and Nine Nether was probably included as well…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Havenlaw Ruler was the sole lord of the Great Havenlaw Domain, her words were equivalent to absolute orders. Even someone as prideful as the Blood Hawk King would not dare to be arrogant before the Great Havenlaw Ruler. And the Great Havenlaw Ruler clearly gave Mu Chen and Nine Nether special treatment. Just that point alone was sufficient to intimidate those that were unhappy with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the back mountain of the Nine Nether Palace</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sat on the mountain peak with his eyes closed. Incorporeal lightning coiled around him with piercing thunderous roars that faintly resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those piercing thunderous roars had special fluctuations to them. If there was someone else here, they would definitely be affected by the thunderous roars and their heart would have become a mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because those thunderous roars were clearly the Nether Demon Heart Lightning. Right now, Mu Chen was still training in the Supreme Demon Heart Scripture with the help of the Nether Demon Heart Lightning that he had obtained from the depths of the Demonic Lightning Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The whistling of thunderous roars lasted for an hour before Mu Chen slowly opened his eyes and placed his hand on his chest. After having the Nether Demon Heart Lightning continuously strike his heart, he could sense that the Demon Heart energy being injected into his heart was getting denser. But what made Mu Chen disappointed was the fact that the Demon Heart Seed had yet to be refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like this Supreme Demon Heart Scripture is truly not easy to train.” Mu Chen helplessly curled his lips. But it did make sense. If it was so easily cultivated, then the Supreme Demon Heart Scripture wouldn’t be so terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lowered his head in the direction of the Nine Nether Palace. It was already dark, but the Nine Nether Palace was still busy. Because of the war, the Nine Nether Palace had obtained a large amount of resources, forming a recruitment preparation camp for the Nine Nether Troop under Nine Nether’s orders with the amount reaching four thousand. Clearly, there was a huge difference if it was to be compared to the strength of the Nine Nether Palace, so they had to be carefully nurtured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, generally speaking, the Nine Nether Palace was gradually rising and was no longer covered in the dead atmosphere it was in a year ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these changes were due to Nine Nether’s return and Mu Chen’s appearance, and Mu Chen was also rather pleased with these changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re cultivating the Supreme Demon Heart Scripture?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Mu Chen was submerged in these changes, an astonished tender voice suddenly resounded from the rear. Mu Chen was taken aback and immediately turned around. On a huge rock, there was a little girl swinging her fair little feet with a smear of astonishment on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who else could it be aside from Mandala, who was also the Great Havenlaw Ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mandala, Mu Chen immediately stood up and showed an unnatural grin. He had been too casual with the latter in the past, so when he was about to show respect upon seeing her, he felt a little weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just treat me as Mandala.” Mandala cast a glance at Mu Chen with her hands on her cheeks, “Furthermore, I can tell that even if I am the Great Havenlaw Ruler, I don’t have much respect in your heart. So you don’t have to pretend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen awkwardly smiled. He would fear the Great Havenlaw Ruler’s strength, but it was impossible for him to feel respect in his heart. Although she had seen through his thoughts, Mu Chen still smiled casually, “Thanks for this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was naturally talking about the protection for him and Nine Nether. He wasn’t stupid to tell that Mandala had paid a huge price because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have done a great service to the Great Havenlaw Domain, so if I abandoned you in the blink of an eye, it would make others feel cold in their heart.” Mandala casually said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rubbed his nose, it was a little hilarious for such words to come from an Earth Sovereign expert. After all, with Mandala’s strength, the so-called “loyalty” was just others’ fear towards her. So she wasn’t worried about others being disloyal to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In addition, you have helped me, so I will definitely pay you back.” The words from Mandala after that had clearly more thoughts behind it, which made Mu Chen a little dumbfounded. So, in her view, his help to her seemed to be much more important than the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Here.”</span></p>

He blankly looked down and saw a crystal-clear jade bottle filled with crystal liquid and a surge of shocking Spiritual Energy fluctuations emanating from it.</span></p>

It’s all due to your effort that we could win, so this is your reward.” Mandala casually said.</span></p>

He worked so hard to flip the Demonic Lightning Sect and could only obtain a few hundred thousand Sovereign Spiritual Liquids. Furthermore, those weren’t for him because he knew that the Nine Nether Palace required a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids to maintain its development.</span></p>

With it, they could swiftly speed up their cultivation. Also, Mu Chen also required an astronomical amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids to unlock the Sovereign Ability of the Great Solar Undying Body. But he was dead broke right now and was having a headache about this matter. Who could have expected that there would be a sudden arrival of 200,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, which made him feel a halo of bliss.</span></p>

Although he felt like rejecting, he still accepted it with his lips pursed and heavily nodded his head at Mandala. “Thanks.”</span></p>

As the night breeze blew, her long hair fluttered in the wind, which made this little girl look flimsy. She looked at Mu Chen and said, “You will represent the Great Havenlaw Domain by participating in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven in three months time. Liu Yan will surely target you, so I will personally train you during these three months. If you do not reach a level that I will be satisfied with, I will seize your qualification for it.”</span></p>
