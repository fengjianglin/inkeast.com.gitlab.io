 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone narrowed their eyes as they looked at the sky. They saw Mu Chen standing on the air with three blurry black shadows emitting killing intent, their palms about to reach him. It was a force which could gravely injure Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was a girl that had abnormally appeared with her hand placed on the back of one of the black shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dreadful Spiritual Energy contained in that palm of hers had instantly caused the black shadow to freeze. The palms that were about to hit Mu Chen had also frozen, since he knew that if he landed this attack, then the attack at his rear would cost him a disastrous price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere in the sky had been frozen at this moment, and no one dared to break this quietness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the Netherworld Prince frantically flickered. A ruthless and fearful light flashed in his eyes, which caused his indifferent face to look a little distorted at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince’s eyes were filled with dense unwillingness as he looked at Mu Chen. If he had a few more breath’s of time, he would be able to get rid of Mu Chen. However, he never thought that… Cai Xiao would be faster in terms of speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she could appear here, that practically meant that Fang Yi had failed. It also implied that his plans of dealing with Mu Chen had failed as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked a the Netherworld Prince, whose eyes were frantically flickered, and lightly smiled. Even if the sharp palm force was just before him, there wasn’t any fear in his eyes at this moment. On the contrary, the pair of phoenix wings behind him slowly folded, before they disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You lose.” Mu Chen repeated his words once again as he looked at the Netherworld Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you seeking death?” The Netherworld Prince darkly said. Right now, Mu Chen’s life was practically in his hands, but there wasn’t any fear being shown by the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have enough courage to exchange lives.” Mu Chen’s black pupils stared at the Netherworld Prince as a ridiculing arc rose on the corner of his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince’s eyes narrowed. Although Mu Chen was currently in his hands, the latter’s bearing had surpassed him when the both of them faced each other. Under Mu Chen’s fearless pupils, there was an indistinctive strand of fear that appeared in the depth of the Netherworld Prince’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he refused to admit it, he knew that what Mu Chen had said was the truth. He wasn’t courageous enough to exchange lives with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince’s gaze flickered, before he deeply inhaled a mouthful of air, then turned his head towards Cai Xiao, who was behind him. “Let us withdraw our hands together. I do not recommend us to completely fall out, since it will not benefit either of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao took a glance at Mu Chen, and he gently nodded his head towards her. Their motive was the Dragon-Phoenix Inheritance, there was, indeed, no need to force the Netherworld Prince to a path of no retreat. After all, even a rabbit would bite someone when they got anxious, not to mention that the Netherworld Prince wasn’t a rabbit, but a ferocious wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince and Cai Xiao were, after all, no ordinary characters. So, they did not go against their words and the two of them had withdrawn their hands at the same time, dissipating the violent Spiritual Energy as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince’s figure flashed, then appeared few thousand feet away and looked at Cai Xiao and Mu Chen with his guard up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gently breathed out in relief. There was a huge exhaustion in the Spiritual Energy in his body. If the fight had continued, he might have completely fallen into a dangerous situation. But fortunately, Cai Xiao was able to defeat Fang Yi first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re formidable.” Mu Chen gave Cai Xiao a thumbs-up. Although he had not fought with Fang Yi, Fang Yi was, after all, the first ranker on the Dragon-Phoenix Record whose reputation was slightly above the Netherworld Prince’s. Previously, he had already experienced the Netherworld Prince’s means, so he also exclaimed in admiration by the fact that Cai Xiao could defeat the even more powerful Fang Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao’s cold expression was replaced with a smile that contained the charm to allure all lives, causing many experts to involuntarily direct their gazes over. However, there wasn’t any disrespect in those gazes, since the strength that Cai Xiao had displayed left them heavily shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re pretty good yourself as well, I did not make a mistake in my judgement.” Cai Xiao lightly smiled. There was a hint of admiration in her eyes when she looked at Mu Chen. In this confrontation, if it wasn’t for Mu Chen executing all his means to obstruct the Netherworld Prince, it wouldn’t be possible for her to defeat Fang Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I nearly failed.” Mu Chen said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was clear that with his current strength, he could only slightly resist the Netherworld Prince. But if a full battle had broken out, the chances of him winning wasn’t high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, no matter what, he was only a Third Grade Sovereign right now, whereas the Netherworld Prince was half a step into Fifth Grade Sovereign. Even in the Great Havenlaw Domain, someone of his calibre could be bestowed with kingship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Mu Chen possessed many cards up his sleeves, he still couldn’t defeat the Netherworld Prince as easily as how he defeated Liu Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have already given me a shock to be able to accomplish such feat as a Third Grade Sovereign. If the both of you were at the same level of cultivation, he would be far in comparison to you.” Cai Xiao lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had to admit that the sweet-sounding praise from such an alluring girl drastically raised his vanity and made his body feel like it was floating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After praising Mu Chen, Cai Xiao turned her gaze towards the Netherworld Prince and indifferently said, “You’re still not leaving?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince’s face slightly changed as he looked at Cai Xiao and Mu Chen with a dark gaze, before focusing on Mu Chen. He said in a cold voice, “My Netherworld Palace will remember today’s matters. I hope that, if we meet next time, you will not depend on a girl to save you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen smiled instead. “Perhaps you will be the one that has to be careful if we meet in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was somewhat hard for him to defeat the Netherworld Prince, he was confident that he could catch up. Therefore, if they were to meet again, in the future, Mu Chen would let him understand the meaning of seeing him in a new light if the Netherworld Prince still thought of forcing him in such a disadvantaged situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impudence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Prince coldly sneered. As a pillar amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region, his pride wasn’t weaker than anyone else’s. Mu Chen boasting that he could surpass him was basically a joke in his eyes. Because if Cai Xiao wasn’t here today, Mu Chen would practically be dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finishing his words, the Netherworld Prince no longer stayed in this place that enraged him, after sweeping his cold gaze towards Mu Chen’s group of two. After that, he turned into a streak of light that flew towards the border of the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He understood that Cai Xiao wouldn’t want him around so that they could safely obtain the Dragon-Phoenix Inheritance. Since he couldn’t covet for the inheritance anymore, there’s no meaning for him to stay any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This grudge could only be settled in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ll have trouble in the future.” Cai Xiao looked at the Netherworld Prince’s leaving figure and gave a-smile-yet-not-a-smile expression to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not someone from the Northern Realm, so I will leave after receiving the Dragon-Phoenix Inheritance. You, on the other hand, are someone from the Great Havenlaw Domain. So you will still encounter Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince in the future, at that time…” Cai Xiao teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head, it was indeed not good news for him to offend both the first and second ranker of the Dragon-Phoenix Record. But, along his way here, Mu Chen had offended plenty of enemies. In the end, his so-called “enemies” had all become the stepping stone for him to move higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, not only was Mu Chen not afraid of those potential threats, he was looking forward to them instead. Because it was due to this pressure that he could become stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you’re worried, you can leave the Dragon-Phoenix Haven with me. I will bring you to a place more suitable for you than the Great Havenlaw Domain. Over there, perhaps you can obtain better cultivation circumstances.” Cai Xiao chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao’s strength was the proof that the force behind her wasn’t an ordinary one. According to Mu Chen’s guesses, her backing was a force that no one could be compared to in the Northern Region. Perhaps it was just as she had said, he would be able to obtain better cultivation circumstances over there and perhaps it might be a place where many yearn to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen still shook his head. He wasn’t used to being protected. On the contrary, he wanted to charge his way through with his own strength and become a supreme powerhouse. A powerhouse that didn’t rely on the protection and resources of any other forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to worry about me. If there’s a next time we meet, I will help you get rid of them.” Mu Chen lightly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao’s brows slightly twitched when she heard Mu Chen rejecting her. However, she was also a little startled by the confidence Mu Chen had in his words. That’s because she knew how formidable Fang Yi was. Even if she had made her move this time, she had also given a huge effort for it. On the contrary, it was clearly a fantasy in the view of others for Mu Chen to get rid of those two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Cai Xiao did not ridicule Mu Chen for his words. She looked at Mu Chen with her alluring gaze and gently smiled. “Okay, then. I hope that if we meet in the future, you will give me some good news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at his response, Cai Xiao shifted her gaze towards the countless revered looks. Shortly after, she looked towards Su Biyue, Hong Yu and Ding Xiang and indifferently said, “Do you guys have any objections in us getting the Dragon-Phoenix Inheritance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Cai Xiao’s words, Su Biyue, Hong Yu and Ding Xuan exchanged a look, before they sighed. Even Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince were defeated by the two of them, what objections could they bring up at this moment? Thus, they could only tactfully shake their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, thanks.” Cai Xiao showed a charming smile on her face. The charm of her smile even made beauties like Su Biyue and Hong Yu momentarily dim in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head, looking at the summit of the Dragon-Phoenix Stage. There was a dazzling golden light being emitted, as if there were endless profundities over there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a hint of excitement in his heart.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon-Phoenix Inheritance was finally theirs!</span></p>
