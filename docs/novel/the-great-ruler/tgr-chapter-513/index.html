As the light gathered, there was w light figure that slowly appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There’s still people living in the Spiritual Treasure Mountain?</span></p>

That light figure seemed to be an old man as he stood on the sky. He said nothing, which caused the originally bustling Spiritual Treasure Mountain to be quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one dared to speak a word. Those that were sent flying earlier on wiped the traces of blood from the corner of their lips as they looked at that light figure in astonishment. Although they did not know who the light figure was, with the Divine Wood Palace’s strength, what they left behind, even casually, was not something that they could deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Energy surged in the surroundings of Mu Chen, Luo Li, Wen Qingxuan and their group as their eyes beacme filled with alertness. The instant something went wrong, they would instantly retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No one is allowed to enter the important place of the Spiritual Mountain. Everything will go by the rules and regulations of the Divine Wood Palace.” Just when Mu Chen and his group raised their guards, the elderly light figure spoke. There wasn’t any emotions in his voice, which made it sound especially empty. But just that alone could make one’s hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t seem to be a living person.” Hearing that voice, Mu Chen’s expression slightly changed as he gazed towards the elderly man. He realised that the latter did not wear any expression on his face, his eyes were especially empty, without any human emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps this is a Spiritual Clone left behind by a certain formidable figure of the Divine Wood Palace.” Luo Li said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan stealthy breathed out in ease. It was fine as long as that was not the original body of that old demon. Otherwise, they would only flee for their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, with him obstructing our path, there’s no way for us to make our way past him.” Xu Hung said softly from the side. He clearly saw the scene of those unlucky fellows earlier. Furthermore, there was still some people being trapped. Who knows what awaits them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t he say that everything will follow the rules and regulations of the Spiritual Treasure Mountain?” Mu Chen said softly as his eyes flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the rules and regulation?” Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan were a little blank and at a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shook his head as his gaze fixed onto that light figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are a total of Nine Levels in the Spiritual Treasure Mountain. The higher the level, the treasure awaits would be more precious. Every single Spiritual Treasure has a puppet guarding it. Only by defeating the puppet, can one leave with the Spiritual Treasure. Those that fail the challenge will be trapped for half a year as punishment for not working hard in their cultivation and yet, biting off more than what he or she can chew.” Just when everyone was in doubt, that light figure spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, those are the rules.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and his group then understood. But then shortly after, they were startled by the punishment. Trapped for half a year? If that happens, then they would not be able to participate in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament that would continue to occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like the rules are meant to encourage the disciples of the Divine Wood Palace to cultivate. Perhaps they have never imagined that the Divine Wood Palace would fall into such a situation. None of us here is a disciple of the Divine Wood Palace,” said Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That means that those fellows have to defeat the puppet guarding the Spiritual Treasures. If they win, they would be able to obtain a treasure from the stone platform, but if they lose…” Mu Chen grinned. Luckily, he did not rashly take action earlier. Otherwise, they might've been trapped to battle the puppet, since it was an extremely dangerous matter for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They, themselves, had no idea how powerful the puppets guarding the Spiritual Treasures were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s take a look and see, then.” Mu Chen said solemnly. If the punishment was that heavy and the strength of those puppets were extremely fearsome, then he would have to give up on the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi, no matter how unwilling he was, since he had no time to be trapped in this place for six months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan and the rest nodded in agreement. Right now, they could only wait and see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mu Chen and his group were discussing, light abruptly surged from the layers on the stone platform. Those that had charged onto the platform all experienced a light figure shooting from the ground. After a brief moment later, the light dissipated and there were puppets being clearly seen by everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The puppets were black in colour, as if they were forged from black metal. There were also profound runes that covered their bodies, flickering with faint light. Vaguely, there were powerful ripples that were slowly being emitted from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of Mu Chen and his group were fixed on those black puppets. However, the ripples around those puppets were especially veiled. Henceforth, they could not gauge the strength of those puppets. Furthermore, those puppets were not identical. Those puppets that were located on the higher layers were emitting an even more powerful pressure from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gave a glance. The Spiritual Treasure Mountain had nine levels and no one intruded into the eighth and ninth level. Hence, no puppets appeared on them. Two people had charged onto the seventh layer and beneath the lower levels, there were more puppets, since there were more people that intruded those levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, those that were trapped on the stone platform were somewhat panicked when they heard the words of that light figure from before. If they failed their challenge, they would have to be trapped in this place for half a year? This kind of price was too heavy, since the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament would have ended by then!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I refuse to believe that the puppets here are that powerful! After so many years have passed, I bet that their strength has diminished!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps the consequences of failure were too serious. One of the intruders that entered the fifth level barked with his face paled as he took a step forward. A majestic amount of Spiritual Energy swept out. The thickness of the Spiritual Energy had already reached the level of Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase and he was only a step away from Human Body Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sole of his foot stepped forward as his figure swept out, throwing a palm at the same time. His scarlet-red Spiritual Energy was like a flame as he attacked the black and gold puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scarlet Spiritual Energy surged out and the light in the empty eyes of the puppet seemed to have condensed. In the next instant, it took a step forward. It did not try to dodge as it's black metal palm was thrown out similarly and the puppet’s attack clashed with that person’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge collusion solemnly rang out as the light exploded. Thereafter, everyone could see the intruder’s body flew out with fresh blood spewing from his mouth as he heavily fell on the ground with his face paled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was in silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a number of people had astonishment in their eyes. Just one move was all it took to defeat the intruder. Clearly, the strength of that puppet had reached Human Body Disaster, but that was only just the fifth level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Challenge failed, imprisoned for half a year.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder’s voice resounded in the sky and with a sweep of his hand, shackles of light shot out and tied themselves onto the intruder’s body. Thereafter, without caring for his miserable shrieks, the ground cracked open, bit by bit, as his body fell into the hole. In the next instant, the ground was restored to its original appearance and the shrieking was silenced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people had their faces paled, especially those that had already intruded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t want to challenge anymore!”</span></p>

Shortly after, he made a wave with his hand as countless shackles of light swept out and tied onto those that tried to escape and were swallowed by the mountain.</span></p>

Escaping before the battle added another six months to the imprisonment time, that would be an entire year of being imprisoned in this land with no living being. Wouldn’t that be harder to bear than dying?</span></p>

Those that failed would, without a doubt, be dragged into the mountain and imprisoned. The shrieks coming from them were extremely sharp. However, not everyone failed their challenge. There were those that were lucky and were spared from it, since they did not intrude onto the higher levels. Thus, the puppets that they encountered weren’t too powerful. After a round of bitter battles, they actually managed to win the battle.</span></p>

His attention was focused on the seventh level, since there were two people that intruded onto that level. Out of those two, one had undergone his Human Body Disaster. However, his strength had only managed to exchange several moves with the puppet before being defeated.</span></p>

Despite that, he still could not emerge victorious. Fortunately, when his Spiritual Energy was thoroughly exhausted and he could no longer move, that puppet had also suffered serious damage with cracks on its chest. As it walked, it was swaying left and right, as if it was about to shatter.</span></p>
