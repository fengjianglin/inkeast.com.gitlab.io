 <p><strong>Chapter 325 - Battling Gu Tianyan</strong></p>
 <p>“Freshman Mu Chen...”</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen’s deep and calm voice rang across the majestic mountain peak, the expressions on Lin Zheng, Zhou Qingshan and Gu Tianyan’s faces all froze as a peculiar shadow appeared within their eyes. They never imagined that the youth in front of them was just a Freshman.</p>
 <p>However, it was such a Freshman that had finally distinguished himself above the rest in this hunt, and had even become the representation of the strongest within the students. This kind of matter made Gu Tianyan feel truly incredulous. While the three Great Generals were still students, Freshmen didn’t even have the qualifications of participating in the hunts, even so much so as becoming the representation of strength…</p>
 <p>“Your batch of students are also truly interesting.”</p>
 <p>Lin Zheng shook his head, before staring at Shen Cangsheng in front of him, whose imposing manner was astonishing, and wasn’t the slightest bit weaker than himself. Speaking to him, Lin Zheng said, “ However, I hope he’s truly something, If not, we’ll presume that your batch of students are truly not worthy of respect.”</p>
 <p>“Haha!” Gripping the golden-coloured spear in his hands, Shen Cangsheng laughed heroically, before replying, “Senior brother Lin Zheng, please feel relaxed. Our batch of students will definitely win, no matter what!”</p>
 <p>“Oh, really?”</p>
 <p>Lin Zheng said with a smile, before taking a step forward. Boundless Spiritual Energy instantly swept out, bringing a surging pressure with it. At this instant, the clouds lingering in the sky were immediately scattered by the pressure wave that was sweeping out.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase.</p>
 <p>Lin Zheng did not have the slightest intent of restraint. Taking a step forward, he had completely revealed his full strength.</p>
 <p>Feeling the strong Spiritual Energy pressure radiating out, the faces of the countless students in the surroundings of the Spiritual Light Mountain had faintly changed as they thought, <em>This Senior Brother Lin Zheng is too strong. If he was placed among us students, the only person who could chat and laugh in front of him might only be Shen Cangsheng.</em></p>
 <p>“Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase. Undeniably, you’re the previous 1st Rank on the Heavenly Rankings.” a ripple seemed to spread out from within Shen Cangsheng’s eyes as a scorching intent slowly erupted from within. Grabbing his golden spear tightly, he furiously stomped his feet.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>At that very instant, the earth seemed to intensely quake, as a similar boundless Spiritual Energy furiously swept out with Shen Cangsheng in the centre.</p>
 <p>Golden-coloured Spiritual Energy illuminated the horizon, completely resisting the Spiritual Energy pressure radiating from within Lin Zheng’s body.</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng’s strength had similarly reached Heavenly Completion Middle Stage, it was not the slightest bit weaker than Lin Zheng!</p>
 <p>“He’s too awesome!” countless students exclaimed excitedly in admiration, as unconcealable worship showed within their eyes. Although the two were of a similar level, Shen Cangsheng was, after all, younger than Lin Zheng. However, his power was not weaker than Lin Zheng. In the competition, it was clear that Shen Cangsheng had gotten the upper hand. If he were to reach the same age as Lin Zheng, he would definitely far exceed the current Lin Zheng.</p>
 <p>The Overlord of the Heavenly Rankings sure deserved his title.</p>
 <p>“No bad.”</p>
 <p>Facing the Shen Cangsheng in front of him, even Lin Zheng had faintly nodded his head in approval, with admiration even showing in his eyes. He had a lot of sentiment towards the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Being able to see his Junior Brothers exceeding him, other than sighing in lamentation, he felt exceedingly gratified.</p>
 <p>As of now, Shen Cangsheng’s strength was worthy to be treated seriously.</p>
 <p>While Lin Zheng and Shen Cangsheng were locked in a confrontation, Li Xuantong and Zhou Qingshan had also exhibited their strongest might. The degree of Spiritual Energy of the two was slightly inferior than the former two; however, it had also reached the degree of Heavenly Completion Initial Stage, When the two boundless Spiritual Energies radiating from the latter two collided, peals of thunder seemed to form and ring out.</p>
 <p>The opponents for these two fights were exceptionally similar to each other. Furthermore, all of them clearly possessed abundant combat experience. Added with their various skills and techniques, wanting to quickly find the victor was clearly not an easy matter.</p>
 <p>Therefore, countless gazes started to turn and landed on the giant peak where the third fight was. Over there were the two people with the greatest disparity in strength. Of the three fights, it was clearly the place where the difference was easiest to determine</p>
 <p>“Looks like you’ve become the most critical key.”</p>
 <p>Gu Tianyan retracted his gaze from the other two fights in the distance and looked towards Mu Chen. With his capabilities, he was naturally able to see that the people in the two fights were of similar strength. If they continued like that, the result would most likely be a draw. And if they were both to draw, their fight over here would be the critical point to determine victory or defeat.</p>
 <p>If Mu Chen won, all of the students would able able to smoothly pass through this hunt. If he were to lose, the result would be self-evident that everyone would leave with empty hands.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen pursed his lips as the expression in his eyes turned dignified; however, he did not reply to Gu Tianyan.</p>
 <p>“Although your strength doesn’t seem to be strong, your courage isn't small. This placement isn’t something that ordinary people would dare to accept.” Gu Tianyan said indifferently. He was once a student, and had also participated in the hunts, and was even the strongest student representative in that batch. Therefore, he was very clear of how much pressure that place gave. With that kind of strength, Mu Chen was still able to stand up. This kind of pressure was exceptional.</p>
 <p>It was this point that made Mu Chen feel rather pleasing to Gu Tianyan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Although this place is very stressful, someone has to stand up.” Mu Chen replied in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>Hearing his reply, Gu Tianyan nodded his head before retreating two steps. Inserting his hands into his sleeves, his fiery-red hair was blown by the mountain winds till they resembled flames fluttering and dancing. He slowly spoke out, “ Looking at your courage, I’ll let you make the first move.”</p>
 <p>After all, Gu Tianyan had arrogance in his blood, with his strength far outclassing Mu Chen. He was also older; therefore, he felt it was not worth his dignity to get the first attack off.</p>
 <p>“Then, I’ll thank Senior Brother Gu.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was not stupid to let go of this kind of opportunity. As of now, he was the inferior side. If he was unable to guarantee even this kind of opportunity, even Gu Tianyan might shake his head towards him.</p>
 <p>An unreasonable person was not worthy of high regards to him.</p>
 <p>Gu Tianyan faintly nodded his head. Obviously, Mu Chen’s decisiveness made him feel rather satisfied. If he continued to force his way in a fight, that would simply be taking everyone’s hard work and making a joke out of it.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen took a deep breath, Without saying any more words, his body fluttered back as he retreated. In the next instant, he sat down high in the air, as his eyes slowly started to close.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Gu Tianyan was faintly startled, before a peculiar expression erupted from his eyes. This was due to him noticing Spiritual Seals starting to condense around Mu Chen’s body.</p>
 <p>“So he’s a Spiritual Array Master…” Gu Tianyan understood in a flash, before an interested expression erupted from his eyes.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s mental state had already calmed down. He blocked all of the disturbances coming from the outside world as his mental state sunk down, trying hard to find the miraculous feeling he had felt when he touched the “Heart Eye” state.</p>
 <p>Facing an opponent on the level as Gu Tianyan, he simply did not the slightest chance of winning, as he did not have the qualifications to drag the fight on. He had to use his genuine method the moment he took action; if not, he would not have the slightest chance of success.</p>
 <p>Arranging a Rank 5 Spiritual Array was obviously one of the strongest methods Mu Chen had in his arsenal.</p>
 <p>As of now, Mu Chen was a Rank 4 Spiritual Array Master. Wanting to successfully arrange a Rank 5 Spiritual Array, he had to rely on the “Heart Eye” state. However, as of now, Mu Chen simply had no guarantees in entering this state, and could occasionally touch it. Thus, the current him could only work hard in order to feel that miraculous feeling once again, and rely on it to enter the “Heart Eye” State.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen had completely calmed down as Spiritual Seals continued to condense around his body. However, he did not have the intention of bringing this a step higher. This pace that was not hurried or rush continued to spread out.</p>
 <p>Countless gazes were already converged on Mu Chen’s body. Even on the northern public square, everyone had trained their eyes tightly onto him. All of them wanted to know exactly what Mu Chen wanted to use to contend against Gu Tianyan, whose strength was at the Heavenly Completion Stage Initial Phase.</p>
 <p>On the podium in the northern public square, a few elders started to narrow their eyes as they looked at the gigantic light screen in the sky that was showing the fights of the Heavenly Completion Stages. This was already enough to spark interest in them.</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>The eyes of Dean Tai Cang, which were as deep as the starry sky, suddenly had faint fluctuations as he looked with some astonishment at the figure of Mu Chen in the light screen. Beside him, a number of white-haired Elders started to make startled noises.</p>
 <p>“These fluctuations…” the eyes of a white-haired Elder lit up a bit, before saying with a gentle smile, “ Interesting. This Mu Chen seems to have a high talent in his training in Spiritual Arrays. He’s actually able to reach the initial contact with the Heart Eye State. Not simple…”</p>
 <p>As the voice of the white-haired Elder rang out, on the giant peak, the Spiritual Energy fluctuations around Mu Chen’s body suddenly erupted out. The Spiritual Seals that were already formed shattered in an instant, before condensing again at an astonishing speed.</p>
 <p>The number of Spiritual Seals had also explosively increased multiple times. In a short span of a number of breaths, it had exceeded over two hundred!</p>
 <p>“Rank 5 Spiritual Array?” countless people involuntarily cried out in shock. Only when arranging a Rank 5 Spiritual Array would one need so many Spiritual Seals.</p>
 <p>The expression on Gu Tianyan’s face changed as he stared, with some astonishment, at Mu Chen. He never thought that the latter would actually be able to arrange a Rank 5 Spiritual Array. He thought, <em>This Mu Chen truly has some capabilities. No wonder why he would be able to allocated the third strongest representative spot.</em></p>
 <p>“Huuu!”</p>
 <p>Around Mu Chen’s body, hundreds of Spiritual Seals rushed towards the sky, before rapidly assimilating into the air. Instantly, the Spiritual Energy of the world erupted out. As Spiritual Energy swept out like gales, they took a form across the horizon.</p>
 <p>Incomparably complicated rays of Spiritual Energy rapidly formed an outline. In the next moment, they had formed an incomparably large Spiritual Energy light array that was faintly discernable in the sky, while tyrannical Spiritual Energy fluctuations gushed out.</p>
 <p>As the light array enveloped the horizon akin to two black lotuses, it slowly revolved, radiating with astonishing pressure.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mu Chen opened his eyes and looked at the formed Spiritual Array, before deeply exhaling in relief. Although the time he took was somewhat long, he was fortunately able to successfully arrange it.</p>
 <p>“Not bad. Never would’ve imagined that you’re capable of arranging a Rank 5 Spiritual Array…”</p>
 <p>At this time, Gu Tianyan had slowly spoke. Raising his head to look at the incomparably large Spiritual Array, he faintly smiled while saying, “So, this is your method?”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing his words, Mu Chen gave a faint smile. With a clench of his palm, a metallic ball, covered in rust spots, appeared in a flash. With a flick of his finger, the metallic ball shot out. Rays of Spiritual Energy that hid the skies and covered the earth erupted out. Under the shocked gazes of countless people, it rapidly took shape.</p>
 <p>The Spiritual Energy fluctuations coming from it were not any weaker than the Rank 5 Spiritual Array that Mu Chen had just successfully arranged!</p>
 <p>That means that this Spiritual Array was a Rank 5 Spiritual Array!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen had, unexpectedly, thrown out two Rank 5 Spiritual Arrays at once!</p>
 <p>As Gu Tianyan gazed at the gigantic objects in the sky, the tranquil expression on his face finally started to become grave, bit by bit.</p>
