His fingers were lightly tapping the armrest of the chair, but he did not speak. However, there was a formless pressure spreading out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was similar to a hawk hunting its prey, the ferocity was extremely fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An expert whose strength had reached the Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm wasn’t something that Mu Chen could contend against. However, he only frowned his brows a little, and his expression had remained calm. Back then, he had even endured the pressure coming from Luo Tianshen, and there was a significant gap between Blood Hawk King and Luo Tianshen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when the pressure was spread out, a cold snort came from Nine Nether as she dissipated the pressure around Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Blood Hawk King, Wu Tian maintained a smiling expression. However, his smile was a little eerie as he apparently never expected that his decision to have Zhao Yue go out would give Mu Chen a chance to perform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on the means and ability he had displayed earlier, he was apparently not any weaker than the ordinary Domain Lords.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a good method this brother has, my hands are a little itchy now. I wonder if you want to spar a little?” Wu Tian looked at Mu Chen as he gave a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that Blood Hawk King did not want to return the quota of the Greatlaw Goldpond back to Nine Nether, and Mu Chen had defeated Zhao Yue right now. If he did not act and oppress the spirit of the other party, the Nine Nether Palace might really get what they want.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Wu Tian’s words, many Domains Lords in the hall slightly twitched the corner of their mouths. Among the Domain Lods in the Great Havenlaw Domain, Wu Tian’s ranking was towards the front. And right now, he was apparently a little overbearing to act this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t see any more need for a battle between Domain Lords. If you feel that my Nine Nether Palace doesn’t have the ability, then have a battle between the Kings. If you lose, hand over all your quotas.” Nine Nether had a calm expression because she knew Mu Chen’s strength. Although the latter had many cards up his sleeves, he had yet to refine his Sovereign Celestial Body. Perhaps he might be able to confront a First Grade Sovereign Realm, but Wu Tian had already reached the Second Grade Sovereign Realm. If they were to fight, Mu Chen might not gain any advantage at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words were somewhat calm, but it gave everyone else in the hall a shock in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle between Domain Lords could be considered a small trifle. If it was a battle between the Kings, that was somewhat serious. The moment one party lost, there would be a massive blow to the prestige of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, when hearing Nine Nether’s words, even Blood Hawk King had narrowed his eyes. If Nine Nether’s strength had remained as it was in the past, it would be something that would he yearn for. But now that Nine Nether had returned after succeeding her Tribulation, her strength was clearly not something to belittle. Before he had a thorough grasp of her strength, it was clearly an irrational decision to fall out completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">*Cough…*</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up on the lotus stage, Sky Vulture Emperor finally gave a light cough as he said in an old voice, “Like the other King forces of the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Nine Nether Palace naturally has the qualifications to compete for the Greatlaw Goldpond. In the past, when Nine Nether wasn’t around, the quota was temporarily replaced. Now that she is back, the quota will be returned to her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Pupils Emperor smiled and did not say a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Blood Hawk King cast a glance at the Spiritual Pupils Emperor. Realising that the latter did not refute, he nodded his head. “Since Lord Sky Vulture Emperor has already said so, the quota will be returned to the Nine Nether Palace. As for the 1000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids that was given to them back then, there’s no need for them to be returned. Let to Nine Nether Palace keep them. Since there are a thousand things to do in the Nine Nether Palace, you would require those Sovereign Spiritual liquids, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finishing his speech, he gave Nine Nether a smile. His smile was filled with a slight ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether also gave him a reply with a smile filled with a chill, “Since the quota has been settled, then let us discuss the cities that belonged to our Nine Nether Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, the expression of Blood Hawk King grew dark. He didn’t place the quota of the Greatlaw Goldpond with importance, even if Mu Chen were to go compete, he didn’t believe that the latter could emerge among the many Domain Lords and obtain the limited quota. Thus, he could give them a step; but, right now, Nine Nether wanted to take back all the cities that were already under his control, and it was not something that he could tolerate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those cities provided him with a significant amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids every year, allowing the Blood Hawk Hall to rapidly develop and continually strengthen himself. The Sovereign Spiritual Liquids were something that could not be lacked, so he was absolutely unwilling to hand out those fat sheeps that he had taken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Nether, isn’t your appetite a little too big when you have just returned?” Blood Hawk King coldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m just taking back what belongs to my Nine Nether Palace to begin with.” Nine Nether faintly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those cities weren’t forcefully taken by me. You have left the Nine Nether Palace for so many years, since when have you done your part to protect those cities? Since you couldn’t protect others, it’s natural for others to seek a new master.” Blood Hawk King coldly sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blood Hawk King, we all understand, why speak with such dignity about it? Did you think that I am unaware of your threats in the dark?” Nine Nether refuted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the palace, the two had cold gazes and did not let out a single step. The remaining Kings kept quiet as they allowed the two to fight. They, apparently, had no intentions to join this mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The both of you can stop arguing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the lotus stage, Spiritual Pupils Emperor, who had not been speaking, swept his pitch-black eyes at everyone. “Our Great Havenlaw Domain has its own rules and regulations. As long as it was within the rules, anything can be done. As for the ownership of those cities, if anyone is unhappy, feel free to act. Just like my words from before, as long as it is within the rules.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Nine Nether furrowed her brows, while Blood Hawk King smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain, they naturally knew the rules and regulations of the Great Havenlaw Domain. The territories in it were vast, and amongst those territories, there were many cities. A majority of those were controlled by the Great Havenlaw Domain, while the remaining territories were left to the Nine Kings to manage. Amongst the Nine Kings, there would be some that weren’t harmonious and would occasionally compete for territories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for those competitions, the Great Havenlaw Domain had not stopped them, but there was a rule. No King could partake in the competition, only their subordinates were allowed to compete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the Nine Nether Palace could be considered as the weakest amongst the Nine Kings. As for Domain Lords, there was only one, Mu Chen, who had just obtained the qualification. As for the other King forces, they had many powerful experts under them, as many as clouds. If they were to fight, the Nine Nether Palace clearly couldn’t get any advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, although Spiritual Pupils Emperor’s words didn’t seem to be helping either side, they had actually turned down Nine Nether’s attempt to retrieve those cities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, it wasn’t possible for Mu Chen of the Nine Nether Palace to confront those forces with as many experts as clouds all by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether clenched her teeth. Just when she was about to speak, she saw Sky Vulture Emperor lightly shaking his head at her. Only then did she unwillingly swallow the words that she was about to say and coldly said, “Since that’s the case, then we’ll see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You're welcome to try anytime.” Blood Hawk King laughed without placing Nine Nether’s sharp words in his heart. After all, the difference between the two forces under them was too significant. Although Mu Chen had defeated Zhao Yue, Zhao Yue merely ranked among the middle of the many Domain Lords in the Blood Hawk Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not say a word after seeing how the situation developed, then his figure moved and appeared behind Nine Nether.</span></p>

No matter what, she had at least seized the qualification for Mu Chen. As for the things that had been taken, there would be</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">a time in the future to deal with them.</span></p>
