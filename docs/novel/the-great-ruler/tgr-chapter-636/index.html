The entire academy was covered with excitement and a cheerful atmosphere.</span></p>

Even the higher-ups of the academy might probably be submerging in celebrations right now. After all, it had been a long time since such results were produced, aside from the peak period when the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was established.</span></p>

The vast training ground was filled with silhouettes.</span></p>

Indolence and warmth made him involuntarily close his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This peace was delightful for him. After the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament that lasted for half a year, this was nearly an impossible luxurious enjoyment. Only after going through the pressing and intense tournament, would he know that this moment was incredibly precious.</span></p>

She plucked out a strand of grass with her pearly-white fingers and lightly brushed it on Mu Chen’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tickling sensation made Mu Chen lazily open his eyes as he looked at the girl before him. He grinned and extended his hand, intending on embracing her waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing his reaction, Luo Li quickly dodged as her absolutely beautiful face was filled with smiles as she looked at Mu Chen, “The entire academy is celebrating and you, the protagonist is idling here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I really don’t have the strength for it.” Mu Chen lightly supported his body up and leaned against a huge rock, revealing a weak smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen’s smile, Luo Li, who was intending to tease him, felt a little heartache. She squatted down, her crystal-clear eyes were flowing with gentleness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have already done an outstanding job. Did you know? At that moment, when you obtained the Champion, even I felt proud of you.” Luo Li’s voice was gentle, the genuine tenderness shown in her eyes could even melt the stone heart of any man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the voice that was as gentle as water by his ears, the weak smile hung on the corner of his lips quietly melted away and was replaced by an indescribable emotion and satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his eyes, not even the thousands or hundreds of praises from others was comparable to the smear of gentle care of this girl before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give me a hug.” Mu Chen smiled with narrowed eyes as he extended both his arms out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li’s face was red as she shook her head, “I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want!” Mu Chen bounced up as his arms quickly embraced the slender waist of the girl and pushed her down onto the grass in an overbearing manner with him on top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the familiar face that was extremely close to hers, and breathing in the blowing smell, Luo Li’s face flushed red as she raised her small fist and shyly hammered him. “Rogue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not do anything else as he had only lowered his head and looked at the absolutely beautiful face. Unknowingly, the girl had grown even more attractive compared to before. That temperament of hers became even more stunningly charming, which made Mu Chen slightly daze off. As he had started to grow, the girl before him had started to change as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps one day, she would thoroughly shred the unripeness of a girl and become the true Empress of the Luo God Clan. At that time, her fame might be resounding throughout the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had a powerful mother himself, she couldn’t do much for him; on the contrary, it brought him a danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen hadn't issued a single complaint. All these years, he had depended on his own hard work and understood from the start that it was impossible to become a real expert by depending on those blessings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li, who had initially accepted the fact that Mu Chen was going to be touchy, slightly narrowed her eyes when she discovered that the latter had not shown any signs of playing rogue. Her charming pair of eyes was staring at that handsome face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The looks in the latter’s eyes was a little absent-minded, but it was also quietly fluctuating. In the end, the youth still revealed a faint smile. His smile was radiating with self-confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That smile made Luo Li bite her rosy lips and showed a little rare infatuation because, what she liked about Mu Chen was this radiant self-confidence of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li, you are leaving very soon, right?” Mu Chen spoke as he streaked his finger across Luo Li’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The body of the girl beneath him unnoticeably trembled, her crystal-clear eyes had also dulled down a lot at that moment. She had always kept quiet about this matter, but she never expected Mu Chen to be so keen and sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at Mu Chen’s face and softly said, “Grandfather only gave me two years of time, and the allocated time has already passed.” Her pupils were dull in colour as she knew that when they part this time, god-knows when they would meet again. She wanted to stay with Mu Chen, but she couldn’t because, she wasn’t alone. She was the future Empress of the Luo God Clan, she still had to protect the countless clansmen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen, I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li bit her rosy lips hard as the corner of her eyes turned red. She knew that perhaps in the next period of time, Mu Chen would be chasing after her steps, steps filled with thorns and she was well-aware of how much heart-aching effort he would have to pay to stand out in the Great Thousand World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Thousand World was too vast, and there were too many geniuses. Many of them quietly fell before they could even cause a ripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that could stand out in the Great Thousand World were those that had experienced innumerable hardships, in which many would forget themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were possible, she would rather have Mu Chen stay ordinary. At least this way, he could still maintain that sunshine smile of his and wouldn’t be covered in wounds just to follow her footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point in time, she should be staying by his side. Mu Chen revealed a faint smile as he looked at Luo Li’s eyes that were turning red. “Although I want you to stay by my side, it will be too selfish of me to do that. I know that you feel sorry for me, but since you can temporarily push aside the Luo God Clan to be by my side, there’s no reason why can’t I work hard for your sake ”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li, I love you. The Luo God Clan might be too far from me right now, and I can’t make your grandfather and clansmen accept me. It could be so much so that they might even doubt your eyesight and feel that you have only fallen for a guy that has good fortune, but…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the emotions stirred in Luo Li’s eyes as he continued, “Believe me. There will be a day when I will go to the Luo God Clan.
