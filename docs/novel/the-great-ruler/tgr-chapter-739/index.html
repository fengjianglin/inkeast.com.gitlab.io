 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people in this region were dumbfounded when they looked at the light figure on the throne. No one had expected that the stocking attack from Liu Tiandao would be devoured by him in a single gulp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also speechless about the difference in strength between an Earth Sovereign and an ordinary Sovereign. It was too great to the point that it was shocking. If it wasn’t for the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain acting out, that attack from Liu Tiandao would have caused great casualties in the Great Havenlaw Domain. Reaching that level of strength, it was very tough to be complemented with numbers. Unless it was a Battle Formation Master with a powerful troop…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s abstruse eyes had slightly narrowed at this sight. His expression slightly turned unnoticeably heavy. Although it wasn’t a full force attack that he had launched before, his objective had been fulfilled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To receive his attacks so easily and without any chaotic fluctuation of Spiritual Energy, the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain wasn’t in the weakened state he had expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is that possible…?” Liu Tiandao’s gaze was cold. There definitely couldn’t be anything wrong in his information. This period of time should’ve been the time that the hidden injuries of the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain relapse and he should be at his weakest state. But judging from the looks right now, his strength was still as strong as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like Sect Master Liu wants to try fighting with me?” As Liu Tiandao’s gaze was lightly changing, the Domain Ruler on the throne said in a hoarse voice. The rippling soundwaves even caused space to distort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I was just trying to see if Great Havenlaw Ruler has any improvements after all these years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao waved his hand and lightly smiled. Shortly after, he looked at the majestic battlefield. “But with the status of Great Havenlaw Ruler, it will be too much of a bully to partake in a battle of this level. My Sky Profound Palace has some relationship with the Hundred Battles Domain. So if the Great Havenlaw Ruler wants to bully with your strength, then my Sky Profound Palace will not be watching from the sidelines.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will take a look today to how capable your Sky Profound Palace really is.” The Great Havenlaw Ruler sneered on the throne. There wasn’t any fear in his voice that made him believe that the Sky Profound Palace would interfere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao smiled as he stared at the Great Havenlaw Ruler. “Why speak of such words, Great Havenlaw Ruler? You and I know the situation well. If you are to act, I might have to obstruct you so that you will not be able to get involve. Furthermore… if you guys really wanted to go for an all-out battle with the Hundred Battles Domain, I’m actually more than willing for that to happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light around the Great Havenlaw Ruler flickered as he faintly smiled. “Then stop spouting nonsense, speak what you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao smiled, “The Great Havenlaw Ruler is straightforward indeed. I am not the party involved, so you have to ask the three heads of the Hundred Battles Domain what they want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Liu Tiandao’s spoke, Sword Concealing Elder of the Myriad Swords Valley cupped his hands at the Great Havenlaw Ruler with his eyes narrowed with smiles. “Since the both of us are unwilling to go into an all-out war today, we can’t let the Great Havenlaw Domain return empty-handed as well. Since that’s the case, our Hundred Battles Domain would like to suggest a fight to prevent the casualties between us, and we can also get an outcome for today’s matters. The loser of the fight will have to compensate the winner with 1,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids and 1000 cities. I wonder what’s your opinion, Great Havenlaw Ruler?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“1,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids and 1000 cities?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the stakes were mentioned, it instantly caused an uproar. Even the Three Emperors had their gazes flickering. Although their Great Havenlaw Domain could take out 1,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, it wasn’t a small amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the worth of 1000 cities was absolutely shocking. If their Great Havenlaw Domain had to give it out, it would definitely hurt for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inwardly smacked his lips. They flipped the entire Demonic Lightning Sect and had only gotten about 200,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids in total. But right now, a fight from the Hundred Battles Domain had a stake of 1,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids. That resolution was truly shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three Emperors glanced at the Great Havenlaw Ruler, awaiting his decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes, the Great Havenlaw Ruler only briefly pondered and, still without any undulations in his speech, said, “How do you want to fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Simple.” Sword Concealing Elder lightly smiled, “The fight will be separated into three. The battle of Emperors, the battle of the Kings and battle of the Domain Lords… which also means your Great Havenlaw Domain will send an Emperor, a King and a Commander to battle with similar ranks of our Hundred Battles Domain. Those that have the most wins in the fight will be victorious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why so much trouble, the three of you of your Hundred Battles Domain and three of our Emperors will go out directly. Isn’t it more straightforward? Can it be that you guys do not have any confidence?” Sky Vulture Emperor faintly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, there isn’t a meaning behind this arrangement, we have to give the younger generation some chances.” Sword Concealing Elder smiled with his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sky Vulture Emperor frowned his brows and looked at the Great Havenlaw Ruler on the throne. Since the other party was trying to use this tactic, then there would be more uncertainties in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light around the Great Havenlaw Ruler faintly flickered. There seemed to be a gaze that swept at the numerous experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain. After a brief moment later, a hoarse voice without any fluctuations resounded, “Okay, our Great Havenlaw Domain will accept this fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Great Havenlaw Ruler is truly courageous.” Sword Concealing Elder smiled respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, send out the three of your Hundred Battles Domain. I will see what confidence you guys have.” Great Havenlaw Ruler faintly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sword Concealing Elder smiled upon hearing those words. Before they could even speak, the leader of the Great Compassion Sky that had not spoken a word, the Devil Compassion Sovereign, suddenly took a step forth. His abstruse gaze was directed at the Great Havelaw Ruler and he said without any fluctuation in his voice, “Let me seek teachings from the Emperor level of the Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing him standing out, Sword Concealing Elder and the Corpse Mountain Demon smiled, there weren’t any objections from them. It must have been planned beforehand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is indeed the Devil Compassion Sovereign that will be fighting.” Tang Bing looked at the bald-headed man and her face turned somewhat more solemn. Amongst the three heads of the Hundred Battles Domain, the Devil Compassion Sovereign was the most low-profile, and was also the most unfathomable amongst the three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. The Devil Compassion Sovereign was indeed, not an easy opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Devil Compassion Sovereign stood out, the Sword Concealing Elder waved his hand. Suddenly, amongst the majestic multitude of people, a crack opened up and a black figure slowly walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the appearance of that black figure, there was a corpse-like stench that instantly spread out. Everyone directed their gazes over and saw a frail-looking figure covered in black bandages, looking similar to a mummy. Furthermore, there were many bizarre runes faintly visible on those black bandages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s… the Spiritual Corpse King of the Demonic Corpse Sect. Didn’t that fellow disappear for a long time? He actually appeared once again…” Tang Bing exclaimed out as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spiritual Corpse King?” Mu Chen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s the Grand Elder of the Demonic Corpse Sect. His strength was rumoured to be just beneath the Corpse Mountain Demon. But he had gone missing some years ago, many thought that he had fallen but I never thought that he was still alive.” Tang Bing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen frowned his brows. The Spiritual Corpse King gave him a weird feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder which Commander expert of the Hundred Battles Domain will be coming out?” Mu Chen spoke softly. Compared to the previous two, he was clearly more interested in this as it was within his level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Hundred Battles Domain will certainly select their strongest Commander. There are three strongest, Mu Qingfeng of the Myriad Swords Valley, Mo Mo of the Demonic Corpse Sect and Qin Bei of the Great Compassion Sky. Amongst the three, Mu Qingfeng has the greatest reputation, Mo Mo is the most vicious and ruthless, while Qin Bei is the most low-profile…” said Tang Bing.</span></p>

So the Domain Ruler will most likely choose one of those two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rubbed his nose and smiled, “Xu Qing and Zhou Yue are strong, so I will not say anything about them going out. Saves me the trouble of risking my life, anyway.”</span></p>

He saw the Sword Concealing Elder wave his hand once again, and this time, the one coming out would be the Commander expert of their Hundred Battles Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the rear, there were already three people that stood in the air. One of them was Mu Qingfeng, who Mu Chen had met before. Standing beside him, was Mo Mo, who was dressed in black. On the far left was a skinny man that was bald-headed as well, he must’ve been Qin Bei, who was the most low-profiled amongst the three.</span></p>

Both of them flung their lips aside as they took a step back, letting Qin Bei, who had his eyes slightly closed, out.</span></p>

Amongst the three forces in the Hundred Battles Domain, the Demonic Corpse Sect was the most low-profile, but they were also the hardest to deal with.</span></p>

I wonder which three will you be sending out?” Sword Concealing Elder smiled with his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless gazes were focused on the Great Havenlaw Ruler, who was seated on the throne. The light around him lightly flickered as he lazily leaned on the throne with an indifferent voice resounding out, “Sleeping Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the Three Emperors, the Sleeping Emperor, who had sleepy eyes, opened his eyes and glanced at the distant Devil Compassion Sovereign and smiled while nodding his head.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The selection was within expectations as the Asura King could be considered as the strongest amongst the Nine Kings.</span></p>

His gaze that seemed like it could look through the hearts of others swept at Xu Qing and Zhou Yue, before abruptly shifting and looked towards Mu Chen, who had his eyes closed, resting his spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen.”</span></p>

Even Nine Nether, who wasn’t far away, looked over with shock. Clearly, no one had expected the Great Havenlaw Ruler to choose Mu Chen, who had the lowest qualification of all…</span></p>
