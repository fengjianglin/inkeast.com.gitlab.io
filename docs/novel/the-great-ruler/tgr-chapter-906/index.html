This vast region was covered with heavy mountain ranges and innumerable white, decayed bones that were revealed to be from a distant age. That was because the owners of those bones were decent experts, so their decayed bones had gradually dyed this mountain white…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking from afar, it was as if the entire mountain was covered in snow. Only by approaching closer, could one notice the eerie atmosphere with bone dust fluttering along the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, there were rarely any traces of people on the Bone Mountain Range. After all, even though there were many experts that had fallen in this region, there weren’t any worthy ruins around. Therefore, there weren’t that many forces that would visit this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But today, this remote region was extremely lively, which expelled the eerie atmosphere completely…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the depths of the mountain range, there was a platform that was a few thousand feet wide. Looking from afar, it was actually a palm print that was of a few myriad feet wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clearly left behind by a previous expert that destroyed this mountain range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, in this region, there were various forces that descended from the sky and surrounded this palm print. They all looked around and held their guards up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More forces continued to enter but there weren’t any conversations between them. After all, everyone that could make their way into the inner section had true strength. They might even have fought in the past, so they all had complicated grudges between them. There were even some forces that looked at each other with killing intent surging in their eyes, as if they wanted to shred the other parties apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the killing intent did not erupt in the end, because everyone was clear, in their hearts, that the protagonist of this gathering today was the peak forces of the Northern Region. Although the other forces were ferociously eyeing one another, their strengths were inferior.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So those wise forces wouldn’t be foolish enough to upstage the main attraction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the appearance of the various forces in this Bones Mountain Range, a huge commotion suddenly came from a fair distance away from the Bones Mountain Range. Everyone could see streaks of light coming from every direction, appearing in the sky of this vast region with a majestic formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other forces looked over, they couldn’t help exclaiming, “It’s the Netherworld Palace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black clouds surged across the horizon with a troop donned in black armour and an eerie Battle Will gushed from their bodies. Even if they did not make any movements, the Sixth Grade Sovereigns present here could feel the chill on their skin…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the majestic party of the Netherworld Palace stood several figures, with one of them standing at the utmost front. It was a middle-aged man donned in black armour. He had a thin face but his eyes were cold and eerie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind that person was naturally the familiar Netherworld Prince, while a skinny black-robed man stood beside him. His lips that were like blades gently lifted, which emanated sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was naturally the infamous Battle Formation Master, whose fame had spread throughout the Fallen Battlefield, Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire troop led by the Glacier King was defeated by him. Next to the three of them stood several silhouettes with robust Spiritual Energy undulating around them. It was a formation that could annihilate any top forces in the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, the heavily-armoured man faintly swept a glance at the other forces present here, before looking towards the distance, then suddenly laughed a long while later, “Looks like everyone is present here. But since you are here, why don’t you guys show yourselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice calmly spread out, but it echoed like a clap of thunder that resounded between the heavens and earth, like sound waves that rippled towards the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Bones Mountain Range, the other forces were all startled upon hearing those words. Only some lords of the top forces had their gazes slightly flicker before raising their heads, as if they had sensed something…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after the voice of the middle-aged man from the Netherworld Palace resounded, the heavens and earth started to suddenly tremble. It was caused by a powerful Spiritual Energy oppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Spiritual Energy undulated. The other forces had raised their heads, before witnessing a multi-coloured current sweeping over every direction. In just tens of breath, they had already torn through the sky and appeared above the Bones Mountain Range like patches of clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those parties revealed themselves, they all had overbearing grandeur, causing even the surrounding space to endlessly distort from the movements of massive Spiritual Energy. It had caused some top forces to wear grave expressions as they inwardly sighed in their hearts. Indeed, there’s a huge gap between top and peak forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Divine Pavilion, Great Havenlaw Domain, Sky Profound Palace, Myriad Saint Peak, Demon Gate and the Divine Serpent Palace…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a huge formation, in addition to the Netherworld Palace, basically all the peak forces of the Northern Region are present. This is truly a gathering of heroes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The decisive battle of the Hunting War has not started and such a commotion has already occurred. Looks like this gathering will not end peacefully, today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh. Go ahead and fight. If these peak forces don’t fight, then how are we going to rise up? These peak forces have occupied too many resources of the Northern Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>

They also had expectations and schemes as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But clearly, along with the resounding whispers, Mu Chen, who stood on the southwestern side, had looked in the direction of the Netherworld Palace first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw that black-armoured middle-aged man, his body had slightly tensed up. He had clearly sensed a dense threat coming from that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That black-armoured man is the Heavenly Evil King of the Netherworld Palace. He has an extremely high position in the Netherworld Palace and I’m afraid that his strength has reached Seventh Grade Sovereign. Amongst the Kings of our Great Havenlaw Domain, only the Asura King can fight with him.” Nine Nether had also directed her gaze over like Mu Chen had done and said in a soft voice filled with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard those words, he squinted his eyes and nodded his head. Just when he was about to speak, his gaze suddenly shifted toward Lin Ming, who stood behind the Heavenly Evil King. The latter was also looking at him with a peculiar cold gaze. He was looking at him as if the latter was looking at his prey…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen’s gaze directed over, Lin Ming’s lips had risen into an eerie arc as he licked his lips with his crimson tongue and greed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That person is Lin Ming, the Glacier King was captured by him.” Nine Nether said in a cold voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head as he looked at Lin Ming’s peculiar gaze, before slightly narrowing his eyes. His eyes hung low with a dangerous light flickering in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not bother about Lin Ming’s provocation, before sweeping his gaze out towards another direction. It was also a massive party, the Divine Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing at the forefront of the Divine Pavilion was a white-haired man. His body was extremely robust, which vaguely gave others a strong pressure, and a draconic might emitted from his eyes.</span></p>
