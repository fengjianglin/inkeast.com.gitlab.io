 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling golden stage was the only path towards the peak of the mountain. As a golden light spread out, it looked like flowing golden liquid. The scene was exceptionally dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s feet stepped onto the golden stage as he swept his gaze around. The golden stage was roughly ten thousand feet in size, it was very spacious. But now, there were only a few figures in this golden stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Accurately speaking, there were only five silhouettes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Mu Chen had seen the five silhouettes before. Four amongst those five were the current Four Great Domain Lords of the Great Havenlaw Domain. The fifth figure was that tall and sturdy man that Mu Chen had seen when he initially entered the Goldpond Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never thought that this person could also make it to the Greatlaw Goldstage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen was looking at the five people, five gazes were also gathered on him. Aside from Wu Tian and Cao Feng, who were looking at him with cold gazes, the remaining three were a little shocked. They had also witnessed the scene of Mu Chen breaking past the seven Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That scene left them a little shaken, since they understood that in that instant when Mu Chen was able to shake those seven Sovereigns, he wasn’t relying on his own strength, but a fearful spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, there wasn’t any lacking in geniuses, there were many with outstanding talent as well. But those that could become a well-famed supreme expert all possessed an unshakable will and spirit that was out of the ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That spirit could be understood as a form of fearlessness. No matter what sort of opponent, he or she would never retreat. Even if it was a towering mountain that they were unable to exceed, they would also charge at it without any fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fighting for that trace of life in death and undergoing rebirth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The calm that Mu Chen had previously displayed left them a little shaken. It was even more intense than when Mu Chen defeated the four Sovereigns of Mt Mang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, even Xu Qing and Zhou Yue, who were ranked the first and second amongst the Four Great Domain Lords, looked at Mu Chen with a trace of heaviness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, how interesting. I never expected for dark horses to appear this time. It’s truly better than in the past.” Laughter rang out as Wu Tian smiled with narrowed eyes looking at Mu Chen and the robust man. His smile was a little mocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen maintained a calm expression as he slowly walked forth to the corner towards the north. With him also, there was a total of six people on the Greatlaw Goldstage. But there was only four qualifications for the Greatlaw Goldpond. That implied that two people would be eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that could ascend the Greatlaw Goldstage and get through the layers of obstructions were the best amongst the younger generations of the Great Havenlaw Domain. The difficulty of defeating two was probably even harder than the battles from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze slightly changed. His body might seem to have eased up, but the Spiritual Energy within his body was roaring like a ferocious dragon. He was making preparations to explode with fearful power to deal with any attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was silent, the remaining five also did not speak on the Greatlaw Goldstage. But anyone could sense that there was an undercurrent flowing on the golden stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Which two of these six will be eliminated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath the Goldpond Peak, every gaze was focused on the Greatlaw Goldstage. Many people held a nervous gaze as this was the final battle. As long as there was a result, the four qualifications of the Greatlaw Goldpond would be announced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But judging from the current situation, the chances of Mu Chen and that robust man being eliminated was the highest. Although they were dark horses, their foundation was still somewhat weak compared to the Four Great Domain Lords, whose fame had already been established since long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the many gazes, Wu Tian’s gaze was similar to that of a venomous snake as he swivelled on the Greatlaw Goldstage and fell onto Mu Chen and the robust man in the end. He smiled, “The two of you are newcomers, so the both of you will choose your opponent for the final battle. Consider this the preferential treatment that we are giving to the both of you as your Seniors. But, of course… you can also choose amongst yourselves, which will also be a little easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His smile was a little vicious and the hidden meaning behind his words was clear. He was trying to pit Mu Chen against the robust man before seizing the last qualification after there was a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen remained indifferent and did not bother with him. Wu Tian smiled. He wasn’t bothered by that and shifted his gaze onto the robust man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Wu Tian’s gaze, the gaze of the robust man was changing. Judging from the current situation, Mu Chen was apparently easier to deal with. Although he seemed crude, he was scrupulous in his heart, and his keen senses told him that the youth named Mu Chen didn’t seem to be so simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There seemed to be a ferocious tiger hidden within the depths of his black pupils. The moment he explodes, he would definitely bite someone. In his view, if he had to choose an opponent amongst the five, he would not wish to choose Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wouldn’t be able to rest or eat in peace if such a person was his enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gaze of the robust man fluctuated as he deeply inhaled a mouthful of air in the end and gave Mu Chen a friendly smile. Shortly after, he shifted his gaze to Wu Tian as he cupped his fist and smiled. “Fang Lei of Lion-Tiger Mountain under the Great Havenlaw Domain seeks to teach from Commander Wu Tian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke, Wu Tian’s face instantly dulled. His gaze was as eerie as a blade as he stared at the robust man. He never thought that not only would that fellow cause his plans to fail, but he would also even take the initiative to provoke him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the Four Great Domain Lords were present. He could go after anyone but had targeted him instead, did that fellow feel that he was the weakest among the Four Great Domain Lords?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such provocation was something that Wu Tian couldn’t bear. Henceforth, he eerily looked at the robust man named Fang Lei and grinned, revealing his white teeth that were similar to that of a beast. “Good, very good, you’re truly courageous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also a little surprised by the robust man’s choice. Judging from appearances, his threat was undoubtedly weak when compared to someone that was one of the Four Great Domain Lords. But this Fang Lei chose to risk offending Wu Tian and give up fighting him, which made him feel a little unexpected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his choice gave Mu Chen a chance. Because of this, he could prevent the exhaustion of his strength from fighting one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Mu Chen slightly nodded his head towards Fang Lei as he strode forth. His cold gaze swept over the Four Great Domain Lords, passing Xu Qing, Zhou Yue and stopped onto Wu Tian and Cao Feng, who held a calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The new Commander of Nine Nether Palace, Mu Chen, wonders if Commander Cao Feng could grant a lesson?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s calm voice rang out in the Greatlaw Goldstage, the air instantly froze, whereas the atmosphere beneath the Goldpond Peak exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A commotion soared into the sky as countless people showed startled expressions on their faces with lights glowing from their eyes. Their interest was lifted in a blink of an eye. Everyone knew Cao Feng’s past with the Nine Nether Palace, and Mu Chen was the new Commander of the Nine Nether Palace right now. Now that the new and old Domain Lords bump one another, if a battle were to occur between them, it would definitely be interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They wished to know who was more powerful, the old Commander that had betrayed the Nine Nether Palace or this new Commander that was brought back by Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether had already misjudged once, they wondered if she had misjudged a second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the commotion, in the direction of the Nine Nether Palace, everyone in the Nine Nether Troop had a cold expression as they stared at Cao Feng with hatred. The latter had betrayed the Nine Nether Palace and also abandoned their Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To them, there was nothing more hurtful than a Commander’s betrayal.</span></p>

Although they knew that the battle between Mu Chen and Cao Feng was something that would take place sooner or later, they couldn’t prevent billows from rising in their hearts when the situation truly took place.</span></p>

They knew that Nine Nether also had a knot in her heart because of that; after all, it wasn’t easy to dispel the betrayal of someone that you had trusted in the past.</span></p>

He had taken over Cao Feng’s spot, so he had to wipe out the stains left behind by Cao Feng.</span></p>

After welcoming the right person, the Nine Nether Palace would also emit the brilliance that belonged to her.</span></p>

Right now, the battle between him and Cao Feng would also announce the results.</span></p>

Cao Feng revealed a faint smile on the Greatlaw Goldstage as he focused his gaze on Mu Chen, before a cold arc slowly lifted on the corner of his lips.</span></p>
