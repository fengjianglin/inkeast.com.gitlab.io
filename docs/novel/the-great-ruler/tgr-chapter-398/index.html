 <p><strong>Chapter 398 - Mo Xingtian</strong></p>
 <p>The ordinary-looking male dressed in hemp robes stood right in front of Mu Chen and the group. His deadpan-eyes showing not a single fluctuation within them, causing people to feel a chill up their spines.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s gaze locked straight on towards the male before him, while his entire body entered into a tense state, Spiritual Energy started to vigorously circulate within his body. He had sensed an extremely dangerous flavor from the man before him. That feeling had already far exceeded the feeling he got from Mo Longzi!</p>
 <p>Staring coldly at the man harboring ill-intent towards him, a faint guess of the man’s identity started to appear within Mu Chen’s mind.</p>
 <p>Beside Mu Chen, Luo Li’s slender hands were already placed on the hilt of her sword. Once the man made a single move, she would take action without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p>
 <p>“What the hell do you think you’re doing, Mo Xingtian?!” The one that took the lead to speak out was Xia Youran, who roared towards the male, while looking at him with a vigilant gaze.</p>
 <p>Mo Xingtian.</p>
 <p>Even though that person’s name had already rang out within the pavilion upon his appearance, the mention of him by Xia Youran still caused shocked expressions to appear on the faces of some people. People like Xia Youran and Liu Ying were capable of being placed within the top-most level of elites within the younger generations of the Northern Heavens Continent. However, everyone knew that the person that caused people to feel the most dread and terror would be the Demonic Dragon Palace’s Mo Xingtian.</p>
 <p>Although the times that Mo Xingtian had shown his face in the Northern Heavens Continent were far less than Mo Longzi, his existence still caused the hearts of many young geniuses to sink. That’s due to the well-known fact that there was not the slightest rumor of Mo Xingtian ever losing in a fight for the past few years. Naturally, the prerequisite was that the fight was between people of similar cultivation realms.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when looked from a certain perspective, Mo Xingtian could be well-considered as the number one figure within the younger generations in the Northern Heavens Continent. Although such a rumor wasn’t spread around, yardsticks were present within everyone’s minds, since there were things that one could weigh and measure with one’s own judgement.</p>
 <p>Although the geniuses from various places, like Xia Youran, Liu Ying and Su Buxiu, also possessed extremely outstanding talent, if one was to ask who they feared and dreaded the most within the younger generations, their unanimous answer might as well be Mo Xingtian.</p>
 <p>Faced against Xia Youran’s roar, not the slightest bit of fluctuation appeared within Mo Xingtian’s gaze. Continuing to stare at Mu Chen with those deadpan-eyes that contained not one bit of movement, he spoke out, “My current mission is to kill you.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, chilling intent abruptly flashed across Luo Li’s beautiful eyes. With a tremble of her jade-like hand, a sword roar howled out, while a slash of Sword Aura shot ruthlessly straight towards Mo Xingtian.</p>
 <p>Just as the slash of Sword Aura appeared before Mo Xingtian, a glowing halo of Spiritual Energy surfaced around him, instantly blocking the incoming Sword Aura. Shaking his head, he proceeded to say, “That’s a bit weak.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, really?” A chilling glint flashed within Luo Li’s beautiful eyes. Clenching her sword with her jade-like hands, she was just about to launch another attack, before her hands were grasped by Mu Chen. Tilting her head over, the latter shook his head towards her, before raising his head to look at the male, who had caused everyone’s hearts to palpitate. With a smile, Mu Chen spoke out, “If you’re trying to killing me here, I really feel that your brain’s gone wacko.”</p>
 <p>As he said those words, Mu Chen’s gaze turned cold and fierce in an instant, before words as sharp as a blade’s edge rang out from his mouth. “Scram off.”</p>
 <p>Humm.</p>
 <p>Low clamoring voices instantly rang out within the pavilion, since quite a few people looked towards Mu Chen with inconceivable emotions present within their gazes. Clearly, none of them had expected Mu Chen to actually use such a tone against Mo Xingtian.</p>
 <p>A faint sparkle immediately appeared in some of the gazes shooting out from the darkness, with whispers of interest ringing out from them.</p>
 <p>As he heard Mu Chen’s reply, Mo Xingtian’s deadpanned gaze fluctuated for a bit, while he considered about the percentage of success if he toook action now to kill Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Creak.</p>
 <p>Finally, Mo Xingtian took a step forward. However, just as his foot was about to touch the ground, his eye faintly contracted as a dangerous fluctuation suddenly erupted from the beautiful girl radiating with a cold and detached aura standing beside Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Halting his foot, a serious expression appeared on his emotionless face.</p>
 <p>“He told you to scram off. Are you deaf?” The beautiful girl in the snow-white dress slowly raised her lovable face, only to show an icy-cold frostiness permeating throughout her beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>Mo Xingtian’s pupils instantly contracted, before a shiver shook through his face. At this very moment, the beautiful girl had already taken action.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t any gorgeous or magnificent move. Extending her slender and jade-like hand, the beautiful girl gave a sudden clench of her hand.</p>
 <p>As she did so, the space around Mo Xingtian started to furiously collapse. Rays of light shot out from space, forming a glowing net, enveloping all over Mo Xingtian’s body. As the rays of light shot around, black scars started to appear in the surrounding space.</p>
 <p>An incomparable feeling of danger gushed out from Mo Xingtian’s heart and mind as his body started to make a furious retreat. In that moment, his body appeared to have turned illusionary for an instant. In the next second, before those rays of light that were shattering space apart could encase his entire body, he had already appeared in a location a dozen metres from where he once stood.</p>
 <p>Seeing the scene that had unfolded before his eyes, Mu Chen’s eyes faintly narrowed as he thought, <em>That movement skill of Mo Xingtian’s is rather strange and peculiar.</em> In the previous instant, his body appeared to have turned illusionary, truly a formidable fellow. He’s actually able to avoid a strike from Elder Sis Ling Xi! Although Ling Xi had yet to unleash her true strength, she had undoubtedly possessed more than sufficient strength to suppress Mo Xingtian with ease.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that her attack wasn’t able to deal with Mo Xingtian, a faint wrinkle appeared on Ling Xi’s lovable face as a bout of dissatisfaction surfaced within her. In the next instant, patting her jade-like hand on the table’s surface, everyone immediately felt the Spiritual Energy in their surroundings starting to fluctuate and rampage about. The space surrounding Mo Xingtian proceeded to turn abnormally warped and distorted, appearing akin to a spatial prison, completely sealing Mo Xingtian within it.</p>
 <p>“Spatial Prison? Sovereign Realm expert?!”</p>
 <p>Furious roars of astonishment rang out within the pavilion as everyone looked towards Ling Xi with dread and terror gushing out of their eyes, while inconceivable expressions surfaced on their faces. Clearly, none of them was able to believe that such a young girl actually possessed the strength of a Sovereign. When did such a terrifying student appear in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy?</p>
 <p>Ignoring the cries of astonishment ringing around her, Ling Xi gave a flick, sending a ray of jade-like brilliance shooting out of her finger. Piercing through space, it shot straight towards the forehead of Mo Xingtian, clearly aiming to directly take away his life.</p>
 <p>Shock and astonishment filled the hearts of everyone yet again, while everyone was utterly intimidated by the ruthlessness of Ling Xi’s action.</p>
 <p>Being locked within the warped space and unable to free his body, a frown appeared on Mo Xingtian’s face as he looked towards the frightening ray of brilliance shooting explosively towards him. However, despite the impending threat of death, not a single trace of terror or dread appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! You’ve such nerve to actually dare to send an act towards the people of our Demonic Dragon Palace?!”</p>
 <p>Just as the glowing crystal-like pillar was about to strike Mo Xingtian, a faint, cold snort suddenly rang out. In the next instant, the surrounding space shattered, while an ancient and withered palm patted out from within. With a single pat, it shattered the warped space surrounding Mo Xingtian, while sending a flick out, striking and shattering the glowing crystal-like pillar apart.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, fluctuations started to ripple out in the surrounding space, while a black-robed male appeared beside Mo Xingtian. That was the Demonic Dragon Palace’s Black Dragon Sovereign. At this moment, a chilling expression hung on his face as he glared at Ling Xi, sending the frightening pressure of a Sovereign radiating outwards. This caused the expressions of quite a few of the young experts present in this pavilion to change as they hastily retreated away.</p>
 <p>Taking a step forward, Ling Xi blocked the incoming pressure from reaching Mu Chen and the group. A frosty shadow started to fluctuate within her beautiful eyes, while rays of spiritual brilliance sparkled under her slender fingers. At this moment, the surrounding air appeared to turn frozen solid, while exceedingly powerful fluctuations started to faintly converge within the pavilion.</p>
 <p>“So, you’re that Elder of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy that specializes in Spiritual Arrays?” Looking towards the air flaring up around Ling Xi, the unique fluctuations radiating out of her caused his eyes to narrow as he spoke out in a cold and detached tone.</p>
 <p>“So she’s an Elder of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy…”</p>
 <p>“However, she doesn’t seem to be much older than us…”</p>
 <p>“It shouldn’t be hard for an expert with that level of strength to change their outer appearance.”</p>
 <p>‘Hmm, I still feel that something’s not right…”</p>
 <p>The words coming from the Black Dragon Sovereign caused quite a few people within the pavilion to quietly breathe a sigh of relief. However, all of them could faintly feel that something was not quite right. Did such a young Sovereign cause too much of an impact to us?</p>
 <p>“If you’re an Elder of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, I’m afraid that you’ve broken the rules today!” said the Black Dragon Sovereign with a dark expression.</p>
 <p>“Haha. I’ve already warned that guy over there. However, he still chose to attack us…” replied Mu Chen with a gentle smile, though a shadow of pity hung on his face. He had warned Mo Xingtian earlier that if he was to take action, they would similarly have an open reason to retaliate. If that was to happen, it wouldn’t break any rules if Mo Xingtian was to instantly die. However, that Mo Xingtian truly was hard to be dealt with. The previous step forward by him was similarly his way of testing their capabilities.</p>
 <p>However, the only thing that had exceeded his expectation would be the actual strength of Ling Xi.</p>
 <p>“As if this is the place for you to talk, brat!” The Black Dragon Sovereign replied in a frosty voice. He clearly possessed extreme loathing and dislike towards Mu Chen, since the latter still controlled the treasure of their Demonic Dragon Palace!</p>
 <p>“Haha! The Black Dragon Sovereign truly is very impressive to the point of even being able to fight with the students of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.” Faint laughter rang out as a voice suddenly resounded in the pavilion. Spatial fluctuations rippled around Mu Chen’s body as Dean Tai Cang appeared out from within, looking towards the Black Dragon Sovereign with a faint smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Staring coldly towards Dean Tai Cang, the Black Dragon Sovereign sneered, “I’ve never imagined that your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy would actually dare to participate in the Divine Spiritual Mountain, Tai Cang. What’s the matter? Weren’t the deaths of those elite students that year sufficient of a lesson for you guys?”</p>
 <p>Shooting an apathetic look at the Black Dragon Sovereign, Dean Tai Cang replied, “This year’s Divine Spiritual Mountain has yet to start. If you’re too proud of yourself now, you’ll not be able to retract your words in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Oh really? I truly anticipate that day to come.”</p>
 <p>The Black Dragon Sovereign replied in a ridiculing tone. Sweeping his gaze towards Mu Chen, he shook his head and said, “Do you truly think that you’re some sort of rare genius just because you’ve defeated Mo Longzi? Looks like your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy have been getting more and more useless during the recent years. Don’t worry. Since you’ve come here, our Demonic Dragon Palace will let you taste the same feeling that you’ve felt in that year once again.”</p>
 <p>As his voice rang out, he shot out a sneer, before turning around and walking away, with no one daring to block his path.</p>
 <p>As Mo Xingtian turned around, he shot a look over towards Mu Chen, before giving something akin to a smile, accept that the smile contained not one tiny bit of warmth. Those deadpan-eyes of his appeared to be looking at a corpse, before turning around and walking away.</p>
 <p>Looking at the back figure of Mo Xingtian, a chilling shadow flashed with Mu Chen’s eyes as he thought, <em>That Mo Xingtian is truly worthy of being the number of super ruthless figure on the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Bounty List.</em> The feeling of danger that he gave to Mu Chen was far more ruthless that Mo Longzi.</p>
 <p>Looks like there would be twists and turns in this Divine Spiritual Mountain.</p>
