Because her gaze was similar to someone looking at a paedophile…</span></p>

Did you think that it’s because of you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You know about the Immortal Catalog?” Mu Chen asked as his gaze slightly flickered.</span></p>

Although she did not respond, Mu Chen already knew the answer, and his heart couldn’t help jolting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She really knew about the Immortal Catalog, so she must know of the Primordial Undying Body as well!</span></p>

Her voice was young, but there was an indescribable prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled as his gaze flickered. “Then, can you tell me what benefits does this page of the Immortal Catalog brings to you?”</span></p>

It is a mysterious flower that possesses the ability to seal anything. I only need to borrow its power to suppress a curse in my body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Curse?” Mu Chen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A curse that will make someone feel the pain of a living hell.” Mandala’s voice was exceptionally calm as she continued, “It will emit intense pain at any moment. It is a pain that can torture a Ninth Grade Sovereign expert’s soul to smithereens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen felt his scalps numbing, a pain that could even scatter the soul of a Ninth Grade Sovereign?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to try?” Mandala opened her eyes as she looked at Mu Chen. She suddenly smiled and stretched her tiny hand. A smear of scarlet light flew out and shot into Mu Chen’s body at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s body suddenly turned stiffed as he intensely trembled. Blood veins frantically climbed out from his black pupils and his handsome face was instantly distorted as a hoarse voice came from his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable pain had spread throughout the corners of his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That intense pain was sufficient to make others go crazy. But, fortunately, this pain came fast and disappeared fast as well. In just a few breath’s time, it had already thoroughly dissolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sat on the chair with cold sweat covering his forehead, before he furiously looked at Mandala. “What are you doing?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t endure it? This is the pain that I am enduring every single moment.” Mandala lifted her lips as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he looked at the little girl who was hugging her legs, seated on the bed. He didn’t know why there was some pity in his heart. He had only suffered the pain from before for just a few breath’s time, yet he could not take it anymore. But it was a pain that she had to experience every single moment. Also, she could still be so calm under that pain. Perhaps her endurance had something to do with her strength, but it also displayed her stunning willpower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can the divine runes of the Mandala Flower in the Immortal Page remove the curse?” Mu Chen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remove? How is that possible?” Mandala mocked as she continued, “It could only suppress it, at most. Unless it is the real Primordial Mandala Flower, only then can it remove the curse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen kept quiet, since he had never heard of the Primordial Mandala Flower before, so it must be scarce. Even rarer than the three materials needed for his Great Solar Undying Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, I will not seize your Immortal Page. You are already gradually fusing with it. If I were to force my way, it might damage the divine runes.” Looking at Mu Chen’s silence, Mandala thought that he was worried that she would snatch his Immortal Page, so she said, while casting her lips aside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen felt a little relieved in his heart as he cast a glance at Mandala. “You name is not Mandala, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s just a name.” Mandala did not agree nor did she disagree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Also…” Mu Chen looked at Mandala as he said, “This appearance of yours should be fake, right? I don’t believe that someone with such horrifying strength would be a little girl.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath the appearance of this little girl was probably an old monster. Thinking that he had just embraced an old monster, Mu Chen couldn’t help shivering. It was honestly too hard to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen’s state, Mandala coldly snorted, “Don’t judge me by using the age of humans. If you are talking about age, then that Nine Netherbird is also much older than you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not human?” Mu Chen asked in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala cast a glance at Mu Chen, but she was too lazy to reply. Her petite figure rolled into the quilt as she lazily said, “You can cultivate, I only have to be around you to borrow the power of the Primordial Mandala Flower’s divine runes to suppress the curse.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s head popped out of the quilt as she cast a strange glance at Mu Chen. “Isn’t it the greatest benefit that I am not killing you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s lips twitched, then clenched his teeth shortly after. “You win!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sat on the corner of the bed and no longer paid any attention to her. He shut his eyes and formed seals with both of his hands, gradually entering into a cultivation state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mu Chen entered into a cultivating state, Mandala had also drilled out of the quilt and stared at Mu Chen. Traces of a strange light flashed across her golden eyes as she muttered to herself, “Great Solar Undying Body, I never expected that it would appear again…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the next few days, Nine Nether clearly intended to let Mu Chen, who had just participated the competition of the Greatlaw Goldpond, to rest. Thus, he was freer, and when he was free, he would walk around the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the competition of the Greatlaw Goldpond, Mu Chen had gotten back quite a bit of face for the Nine Nether Palace. And Nine Nether intended to retrieve the rest of the reputation of the Nine Nether Palace in a spurt. After all, the foundation of the Nine Nether Palace was the weakest amongst the Nine Kings. If the Nine Nether Palace wished to grow their strength, they would have to take back all the territories that once belonged to their Nine Nether Palace, at the very least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those territories would hand over a significant amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid every single year, and right now, the Nine Nether Palace was severely lacking in Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. Especially after the promise that Mu Chen gave to the Nine Nether Troop, so Sovereign Spiritual Liquid became even more lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a sufficient amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, even existing would be a tough matter for the Nine Nether Palace, not to mention about growing stronger. Also, various factions in the entire Great Havenlaw Domain were probably paying attention to their Nine Nether Palace. Evidently, they wished to see if the Nine Nether Palace would turn out to be a laughing stock after causing such a huge commotion.</span></p>

The words that were brought along were also straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pledge allegiance to the Nine Nether Palace once again.</span></p>

Some even laughed while shaking their heads in the dark. A woman will still be a woman. In the end, her methods were too soft. Did she think that a single sentence that was as light as a feather would make those City Lords that had pledged allegiance to Blood Hawk Hall change?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was indeed as expected by everyone, after sending the news to over fifty cities, aside from those few that were greatly exploited by the Blood Hawk Hall being willing to switch allegiances to the Nine Nether Palace, the remaining City Lords did not give a reply. It was so much so that several City Lords that were close to the Blood Hawk Hall did not express willingness to switch allegiances. They even chased the men sent by the Nine Nether Palace away. Their attitudes were fairly arrogant.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first move of the Nine Nether Palace seemed somewhat weak. Many people had also inwardly shaken their heads throughout the entire Great Havenlaw Domain. The Blood Hawk Hall was also filled with mockingly cold smiles, while feeling that the resentment they had for Mu Chen from the Greatlaw Goldpond was slightly vented out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes in the Great Havenlaw Domain, the Nine Nether Palace still remained peaceful.</span></p>

Her black hair was like a waterfall and her long slender legs stood straight. She lowered her head as she looked at the scroll in her hand. The responses from the cities that were notified of her demands were recorded on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether had a calm expression as she looked at the responses. Not only was she not angered, there was a smear of a smile shown on her rosy lips. After that, she raised her head and looked at the youth that stood straight as a spear. She flicked her finger and the scroll shot into the hands of the latter.</span></p>

After that, he turned around and looked at the army that was like thunderclouds as he faintly said, “You have heard of the mockery in the Great Havenlaw Domain. Some people have a new lord and forgot how to be respectful. How should we treat those people?”</span></p>

Every single Nine Nether Troop had their eyes surging with flames. They had already endured for so many years, and finally, they no longer had to endure anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Other people think that our Nine Nether Palace speaks reason with our mouth…”</span></p>

In the next instant, a tremendous Spiritual Energy gale swept out.</span></p>

Watching him, Tang Bing waved her hand and the Nine Nether Troop soared into the sky like thunderclouds.</span></p>
