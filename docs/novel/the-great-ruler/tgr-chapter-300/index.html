 <p><strong>Chapter 300 - Extremely Dangerous Grade</strong></p>
 <p>The trio’s faces turned deathly pale as they looked towards Mu Chen, who had a faint smile and was staring at them. They had a faint sensation of their scalp getting numb, as the scene they had witnessed caused them to feel slightly absent-minded. Even under the collaboration of the three, they were actually beaten by the youth whose strength was just at the Quasi-Heavenly Transformation Stage.</p>
 <p>“How is he that strong!?”</p>
 <p>Words of bitterness and pain spewed out of the mouths of the trio. They had bitterly trained for a year, and were certain that they would definitely be able to demonstrate their extraordinary talents after coming out of their isolated training. However, who would have thought that they would meet such a cruel and vicious character not long after the start of the hunt?</p>
 <p>It was said that this fellow had just entered the Northern Heavens Spirit Academy half a year ago. However with the capabilities that he had demonstrated today, even all those outstanding seniors would be left eating his dust.</p>
 <p>This fellow would absolutely have the strength to break into the top five rankings of the Heavenly Ranking!</p>
 <p>What a monster!</p>
 <p>The trio felt slightly disheartened, as the arrogance within their hearts was finally smashed and broken into bits. They once bragged about themselves being geniuses. However, when they were truly compared to a person like Mu Chen, they were tossed far far away.</p>
 <p>“What do you want?” After all, Wang Tong was the eldest. Forcing himself to focus, he clenched his teeth and look towards Mu Chen and asked.</p>
 <p>“Although I don’t truly want your pitiful lives in this place, I can beat you three till you’re half-dead. You three should automatically transfer out of this Spiritual Light World. If you three do so, you will lose the qualifications for the Spiritual Light Empowerment.” said Mu Chen with a smile as he sat down on the huge cliff before the trio; however, his voice did not have any warmth in it.</p>
 <p>The trio’s faces’ turned white again, as they had chosen to unleash their abilities during the hunt all for the purpose of achieving the Spiritual Light Empowerment. It was able to grant them an improvement to their strength, allowing them to truly catch up to those influential figures at the top. If Mu Chen really forced them out of the Spiritual Light World, they would lose such an opportunity. To them, this was undoubtedly an enormous blow.</p>
 <p>“However, you can hand over something that would make my heart move, if not…” said Mu Chen with a faint smile, his gaze swept over the trio with malicious intent.</p>
 <p>“We’ve a thousand Spiritual Lights that we’ve snatched from those other fellows. We’ll give them to you. What do you say?” asked Wang Tong as he clenched his teeth.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the three small groups of people that were starting to crowd around not too far away instantly became furious; however, they did not dare to say anything. Whether it was Mu Chen or the Wang trio, both of them were not people that they could deal with.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t much of a fluctuation with Mu Chen’s complexion, as he only extended his palm.</p>
 <p>A glow sparkled within Wang Tong’s hand, and a head-sized crystal ball appeared in a flash. The originally sparkling and translucent crystal was now emitting a fiery red glow, akin to a cluster of flaming suns burning with a blazing light within it. Being filled with a thousand points of Spiritual Lights, it emitted a thick Spiritual Energy fluctuation, causing even the air to start emitting a humming noise.</p>
 <p>The three small groups of people looked anxiously at the crystal ball. It was theirs…</p>
 <p>However, Mu Chen did not care about them. He did not have any favorable impressions of the Wang brothers. He also did not have any favourable impressions of those narrow-minded fellows who tried to play tricks on him. Therefore, with a flip of his hand, he stored the crystal ball, without a slightest thought of returning it to Chen Peng and those groups.</p>
 <p>Seeing his actions, Chen Peng and those groups could only squirm their lips, as they did not dare to criticise him. That was Mu Chen’s spoils of war.</p>
 <p>“You only have this? That’s not enough.” After storing the thousand points of Spiritual Lights, Mu Chen looked towards Wang Tong and said with an indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>“You’re still not satisfied with the Spiritual Lights! Mu Chen, don’t be too much!” shouted the trio furiously as their complexions instantly changed.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen start to walk towards them. With a clench of his fist, the crescent moon blade in front of the trio hummed and shot into his hand. With a casual shake of his hand, a swift and fierce blade light sliced a deep fissure into the ground in front of the three men, before staring at them with a slightly cold gaze.</p>
 <p>Looking at Mu Chen’s cold gaze, the trio’s hearts felt slightly cold. Looking at each other, they finally sighed in dejection. Looked like they were truly unlucky this time. If they didn’t offer something valuable, this fiend would not be willing to let them go.</p>
 <p>“We have some information about the gathering points.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t have that much interest in normal gathering points.” replied Mu Chen, while faintly wrinkling his brows.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, the gathering point that we know about is being classified as an Extremely Dangerous Grade.” said Wang Tong furiously.</p>
 <p>“An Extremely Dangerous Grade gathering point?” hearing Wang Tong’s words, An Ran and the two girls who had remained quiet for the entire time suddenly cried out in surprise. With a change of their expressions on their beautiful faces, they stared at Wang Tong and asked, “You guys actually knew of a gathering point of that grade?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was slightly surprised as he stared at the trio. The current him had some understanding of this hunt, for example gathering points can be differentiate into strong and weak. The gathering points they had found till now were only Ordinary Grade gathering points. Above the Ordinary Grade, there was the Dangerous Grade and the Extremely Dangerous Grade.</p>
 <p>Generally speaking, Dangerous Grade gathering points would have an existence equivalent to a Heavenly Transformation Late Stage, the Spirit General. Furthermore, the variance was not small. As for the Extremely Dangerous Grade, there was a high possibility of a Spirit King appearing.</p>
 <p>Spirit King, one that possessed the terrifying strength of a Heavenly Completion Stage. Within the past few years, there had yet to be any news about a student being able to hunt a Spirit King.</p>
 <p>“This information is indeed enough; however, one might not be able to put it to good use.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen faintly frowned. If he could get his hands on the Spiritual Light from a Spirit King, he would absolutely achieve the maximum benefit from this hunt. At that time, the result of the Spiritual Light Empowerment would definitely be described as perfect. However, he wasn’t a person to let a few good benefits get to his head. Although the Spiritual Light from a Spirit King was extremely alluring, one must possess the capability to be able to enjoy the rewards. Mu Chen’s current strength could be considered as having a great improvement; however, he knew that if he truly faced against a Heavenly Completion Stage, he would still be in danger.</p>
 <p>“You’re guts are too small. Without that little bit of courage, you still wish to shine in this hunt?” sneered Wang Lei.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen shot a look at him. With an expression on his face, the crescent moon blade in his hand started to vibrate, before he pointed the sharp edge of the blade at Wang Lei. Upon seeing this, the latter immediately shut his mouth up.</p>
 <p>“Explain this Extremely Dangerous Grade gathering point to me. With your capabilities, you three don’t have to qualifications to enter that sort of place. There should be some things that you’ve yet to say, right?”asked Mu Chen as he looked towards Wang Tong.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the corner of Wang Tong’s mouth twitched. He never thought that Mu Chen’s foresight would be that sharp. After hesitating for short period of time, he replied, “The number of Extremely Dangerous Grade gathering points in this Spiritual Light World can be counted with our fingers, as there were simply no students that dared to go near those kinds of places in the past few years.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head. Even if it was Shen Cangsheng, and Li Xuantong, that level of influential figures would be cautious, even fear a Spirit King. Not to even mention the normal students.</p>
 <p>Due to that, there was no one who dared to take action against those Spirit Kings. This resulted in their followers increasing over time and getting stronger and stronger. So much so that even though the students’ strength had increased, no one dared to make any plans to go against those high grade gathering points.</p>
 <p>“The gathering point we’re talking about isn’t within those few examples. This is because it was just graded as Extremely Dangerous this year.”</p>
 <p>Licking his lips, Wang Tong continued speaking while his eyes turned fiery, “The Spirit King at that gathering point was born only recently!”</p>
 <p>“A newly born Spirit King?”</p>
 <p>Shock appeared on the faces of An Ran and the two other girls. This kind of information truly had some importance. Although the current students did not have the means to deal with those Spirit Kings who had taken shape for many years, if it was only a newly born Spirit King, they would be able to have some level of possibility.</p>
 <p>If this information was circulated, there would be no telling how many people would turn feverish over the Spiritual Light that the Spirit King would become at such a gathering point. This would be enough for them to take the risk.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen faintly narrowed his eyes. A newly born Spirit King? No wonder why Wang Tong and his brothers would dare to take the risk to head to a gathering point of that grade. Mu Chen knew that even with the strength of the three brothers, it would not end smoothly if they faced a newly born Spirit King. Regardless of that, there was a slight possibility for success, after all.</p>
 <p>For the sake of the Spiritual Light of a Spirit King’s Level, it was worthwhile for the trio to risk a chance.</p>
 <p>“How many people know about this information?” asked Mu Chen in a slightly deep voice.</p>
 <p>Wang Tong faintly frowned and shook his head, as he replied, “How would I know? This bit of information was placed within the Spiritual Value Hall by the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Although the people who purchased it was extremely small, there would still be some people who would have an inclination to such information.”</p>
 <p>“That is to say that you guys aren’t the only ones who know about this information, right?”</p>
 <p>Wang Tong nodded his head and replied, “ You should not wish to have exclusive information within this Spiritual Light World, as the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy wants everyone to compete over it. As if it would that easy to find such exclusively convenient information by yourself.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen smiled and extend his hands, “Hand me the location.”</p>
 <p>Clenching his teeth and feeling incomparably painful, Wang Tong took out a red scroll and handed it over to Mu Chen. After he received it, he opened it up to find a more complex map. On the northeastern portion there was a region that was marked out with a blood red colour. On the side of that region were the words ‘Extremely Dangerous Grade’ written in a scarlet colour, sparkling with a chilling glint.</p>
 <p>It was obviously impossible for the trio to create a counterfeit of such a thing. Furthermore, there should not be any mistake with the information that was circulated by the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Therefore, Mu Chen did not suspect anything and stored it in his Mustard Seed Bracelet.</p>
 <p>“Thank you.” grinned Mu Chen as he waved his hands, throwing the crescent moon blade, which pierced the ground before the trio once again. After rearranging himself, he proceeded to turn around and leave.</p>
 <p>“Wait!” Seeing that Mu Chen was about to leave, Wang Tong hurriedly shouted out.</p>
 <p>Faintly tilting his head, Mu Chen looked at him and asked, “What? What else do you want?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the look coming from Mu Chen, Wang Tong promptly shook his head and replied with a bitter laugh, “Just thinking about discussing something with you. Since we’re planning to head to the gathering point, why don’t we collaborate? Since this information isn't exclusive, there will definitely be other strong groups eyeing it. I feel that, if we collaborate, the possibility to get our hands on it would greatly increase.”</p>
 <p>“You should trust us more; after all, we are still students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. It’s alright to play some some tricks; however, all of us know about what level we should not go to.”</p>
 <p>“If everyone works together, and if we were to get it in our hands, we can discuss how to split it then, what do you say?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked at the Wang Tong, who was earnestly staring at himself. Behind the latter, Wang Lei and Wang Zhong twitched their mouths, but did not say anything, as it was obvious that Wang Tong was in charge.</p>
 <p>After faintly muttering to himself for quite a while, he nodded his head. The Wang brothers’ strengths were not bad. If they hadn’t tried to pull some strings in the dark, they would, indeed, be some pretty good helpers.</p>
 <p>“If you guys want to come along, I won’t reject it. However, I will be the one in charge of things from now on. If you guys aren’t willing, you can leave by yourselves. On a side note, do not do anything that will cross me. If not, this won’t end with something as simple as me squeezing an information report out of you guys.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen shot a deep look at Wang Tong before signalling Luo Li, An Ran and the girls with his hand. Turning around, he proceeded to leave.</p>
 <p>Looking at each other, the trio gave a bitter laugh before hurriedly following him from behind.</p>
