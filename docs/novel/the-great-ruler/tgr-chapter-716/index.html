 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the next few days, the atmosphere in the Great Havenlaw Domain was increasingly rigid. The Kings were assembling the forces under them as countless amounts of news regarding the Hundred Battles Domain was endlessly sent into the Greatlaw Sky. The massive machine, the Great Havenlaw Domain, was finally revealing its capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Nether Palace had also been very busy, since the hundred cities of the Blood Hawk King were swiftly taken over. Although they could not instantly give the Nine Nether Palace great wealth, it was undoubtedly much better than being so unsightly, like before. Also, the Expedition War was a method that could seize resources. If they could grab ahold of this chance, the Nine Nether Palace would be able to truly rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the entire Nine Nether Palace was busy, Mu Chen chose to be secluded in an attempt to reach the Second Grade Sovereign Realm. The majority of the matters were managed by the housekeeper, Tang Bing, since her methodically arranged distribution and command was something that not even Nine Nether could compare with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Nine Nether didn’t have to worry about the matters of the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether Palace, Cultivation Chamber</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen quietly sat as he adjusted his state. After a long while, he grasped his palm and a transparent crystal jade bottle appeared at the centre of his palm. A dark-green perfectly round pill was floating in the jade bottle and a dense pill fragrance was emitted, spreading throughout the Cultivation Chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze was focused on the Sovereign Elixir and he briefly pondered, before waving his sleeves. A brilliant current flew out of his sleeves and coiled around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current was all the Sovereign Spiritual Liquids he had and a majestic Spiritual Energy fluctuation rippled out, thickening the air in this Cultivation Chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sovereign Realm was split into Nine Grades, and the breakthrough of every single grade wasn’t easy. Many people bitterly trained for many years, but would not make any advancement. One could see how great the gulf was between the realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So even if Mu Chen possessed the Sovereign Elixir, he required the aid of a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids to bring out the medicinal effects of it to the limit to achieve a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another amount of nearly 2,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had a slight heartache as he looked at the current. He had given the majority of the Sovereign Spiritual Liquids in his possession over to Tang Bing to support the cultivation of the Nine Nether Troop, so he had less than 5,000 on him right now. Furthermore, this was still after he had retrieved all of the Sovereign Spiritual Liquids in the Spiritual Condensing Bowl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Sovereign Spiritual Liquid couldn’t make ghosts grind ink, it could make Sovereign experts grind ink…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is just the breakthrough of a single grade. In the future, who knows what the colossal amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids I need will be.” Mu Chen said helplessly. It looks like, in the future, he had to think of ways to stockpile a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. Otherwise, if he was on the verge to breakthrough and lacked the support of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, it would be something that could make others cry without any tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shook his head to temporarily suppressed those thoughts and deeply inhaled a mouthful of air. He flicked his finger, causing the transparent crystal jade bottle in his palm to dissolve, revealing the Sovereign Elixir. In an instant, the entire Cultivation Chamber was filled with the fragrance of the elixir.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sucked with his mouth as the Sovereign Elixir turned into a streak of light and entered it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He swiftly formed some seals with both of his hands and space distorted with fluctuations behind him. A colossal Sovereign Sea was faintly visible and he could feel a vast pure Spiritual Energy spreading out within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s mind firmly sunk as he gradually closed his eyes with a grave expression, before swiftly entering into a cultivation state. This time, he must definitely make a breakthrough of a grade in a spurt of energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days quickly passed</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s cultivation lasted for three days. On the first day, the Cultivation Chamber was covered in a tight spiritual mist, and Mu Chen’s figure had disappeared within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although sight could not penetrate through the spiritual mist, a Spiritual Energy fluctuation could be sensed swiftly getting stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The envelopment of spiritual mist lasted three days before it gradually weakened. When the spiritual mist thoroughly disappeared, Mu Chen could be seen with his mouth open. He was sucking in the last portion of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The startling Spiritual Energy fluctuation around him was also swiftly dissipating as he slowly opened his tightly shut eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his black pupils were opened, a flash of light abruptly appeared and Mu Chen’s clothes fluttered, bursting with a surge of terrifying Spiritual Energy ripples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air in the Cultivation Chamber instantly exploded. When the ripples swept to the walls of the Cultivation Chamber, dense light was lit up and the chamber was barely able to withstand the ripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light in Mu Chen’s eyes lasted for a few minutes, before it weakened, and the stunning Spiritual Energy fluctuation was also retracting into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the surface of his body was endlessly emitting lustre, which lasted for a long time. Mu Chen knew that it was because the Spiritual Energy in his body was so vast that he was temporarily unable to retract it into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood up and felt the Spiritual Energy that grew even more vast in his Sovereign Sea. A satisfied smile lifted on the corner of his mouth. Although the gulf was tremendous between the grades of Sovereigns, the Spiritual Energy in his Sovereign Sea was several times more powerful than before when he broke through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, even if he were to face the head of the Four Great Domain Lords, Xu Qing and people like Zhou Yue, he wouldn’t fear them. This time, he gained a little more confidence in the upcoming Expedition War that would soon arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen waited until the surging Spiritual Energy in his body gradually calmed down, before he exited the Cultivation Chamber. The Cultivation Chamber was guarded by the Nine Nether Troop, and when they saw Mu Chen coming out, they immediately bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen waved his hand. “How are the preparations in the palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything is going as planned, we can set off at anytime.” The Nine Nether Troop warrior respectfully answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head. As long as the housekeeper, Tang Bing, was present, every single matter in the Nine Nether Palace would be well-managed. He waved his hand and sent off the Nine Nether Troop warrior. Shortly after, he lifted his head and saw a petite figure in the sky not too far away that mysteriously appeared. Her golden eyes were emitting palpitating pressure in the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s feet tapped on the sky, then her figure appeared before Mu Chen. She swept her golden pupils and said, “Looks like your breakthrough was a success. It does seem to be effective.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With the Sovereign Elixir and so much Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, it would be unjustified to fail.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala nodded her head and said nothing else. She waved her hand and flew away. Looking at her, Mu Chen briefly hesitated before immediately following her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them flew out of the Nine Nether Palace. Under Mandala’s lead, they soared towards the depths of the Greatlaw Sky. Furthermore, she did not conceal herself along the way and flew as fast as lightning. This made Mu Chen a little panicked as the guard in the Greatlaw Sky was very tight. The guards here weren’t from other troops, but they belonged to the Great Havenlaw Troop, a powerful troop that was under the direct control of the Domain Ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the situation that Mu Chen was worried about did not occur. Although there were experts that regularly patrolled the area, Mu Chen seemed to have entered into a void under Mandala’s guide as no one could sense him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen once again witnessed the formidable means of Mandala. Even in the Greatlaw Continent, with her strength, she was definitely not nameless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two entered the depths of the Greatlaw Sky without any obstructions, before they stopped before a massive black peak. Mandala gently waved her hand. There seemed to be a gigantic black array appearing on the mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peak trembled as a crack slowly opened at this moment. Mandala flew in first, with Mu Chen closely following behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Entering the body of the mountain through the crack, the scene before his eyes made Mu Chen startled. The interior of the mountain was hollowed out and ancient black runes were carved on the wall of the interior mountain, vaguely emitting a mysterious light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stared at those ancient runes as a smear of shock flashed in his eyes because he realised that those runes seemed to be forming a powerful Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The complexity of the Spiritual Array far surpassed his imagination. This Spiritual Array was clearly not a low-ranked one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You made this?” Mu Chen said in disbelief. Furthermore, he couldn’t figure out how Mandala avoided so many experts in the Great Havenlaw Domain and did not make such a huge commotion in this area. Could it be that the Domain Ruler of the Great Havenlaw Domain had not noticed this? Or had he achieved a common understanding with Mandala?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala still kept silent without replying to him. Her snow-white feet tapped on the ground as she appeared at the centre. It was a pitch-black pond. Although the pond water seemed to be boiling and rolling, it made Mu Chen feel a bone-piercing chill, because the contrast made him feel somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen landed on the edge of the pond and asked in doubt, “What do you need me to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait for my order to summon the Immortal Page.” Mandala lightly said, but her young and tender voice contained unquestionable prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could only nod his head, curling his lips. But before he could say anything, his eyes abruptly widened as the little girl paid no attention to him and stripped off her black dress. After that, a petite and fair figure was revealed in the cold air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t want your eyes, then continue looking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A young voice that contained a slight chill resounded which made Mu Chen shiver in cold. However, he still said with indignation, “You are the one that did not say anything. Furthermore, I am not interested in your figure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen said those words, a huge force surged over that directly sent him flying. And when he had miserably steadied his body and was about to get angry, he saw the petite figure leap into the pond like a fish. That scene was an incredibly moving scene in this cold mountain body.</span></p>
