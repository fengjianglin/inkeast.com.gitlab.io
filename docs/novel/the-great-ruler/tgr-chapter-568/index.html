Looking across, the seemingly endless yellow sand extended to the end of one’s sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, this reddish-yellow desert appeared restless as frightening gales wreaked havoc everywhere they went. Wave after wave of storms battered the entire region, sending sand into the air and blotting the skies, obscuring the vision of everyone present.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The origin of those erratic, devastating winds wasn’t nature, but the huge battle that had erupted within the desert.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Figures hovered in the air as boundless Spiritual Energies radiated from their bodies. As Spiritual Energy fluctuations surged from them, incomparably fierce Spiritual Energies swept out from their hands, before heavily smashing down on the earth before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!&nbsp;</span></p>

Within the current desert, a few figures were present, retreating and evading in a miserable fashion as they defended against those incoming attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was approximately a hundred of those figures present there, appearing to be exceedingly few as compared to the figures who were encircling them, which were more than sufficient to contain multiple times their amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, this was a large-scale encircling battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a spectacle wasn’t a rarity within the current central region. Following the increasing intensity of the fights and battles taking place, there were quite a few groups that started to lump together. The result of this led to the formation of large-scale battles taking place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For instance, the spectacle happening right now, which was precisely a larger collaborative force encircling a small force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their goal was clearly the points held by these groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rampant gales that had wreaked havoc within the desert was a result of the intense battle taking place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sand-strewn skies filled with rampant gales, a figure stood at the lead position. This person wore a set of greyish-white robes, his face appearing exceedingly dry and withered, while his skin was of a slightly peculiar greyish-white colour. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he did not take action, with his hands crossed before his chest as he looked expressionlessly at the groups below, who were putting up a stiff resistance. While the rampant gales blew by, they were unable to even cause his robes to flutter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous figures were present behind this person. These people had ridiculing smiles hanging on their faces as they looked at the struggling groups present below them, appearing to treat this encirclement between two hugely despairing groups as a game for amusement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This group was precisely the group from the Heavens Spiritual Academy. As of now, they were placed 10th on the points ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Captain, once we deal with those fellows, we should be able to rise the 9th place after taking the points of those groups.” Suddenly, a youth smiled as he spoke towards the greyish white-robed male standing in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This greyish white-robed male was naturally the Captain of this group, Lu Tian. As of now, he was a first rate expert that possessed considerable fame and reputation in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that, he merely nodded his head, before shooting a look at the other ten-plus figures standing behind him. Powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiated from all of their bodies, with all of their cultivations unexpectedly at First Grade Spirit Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people could be considered as their collaboration compatriots. However, it was clear that Lu Tian possessed the greatest say and authority in this large group. One could see this from the respectful gazes shooting from the few other Group Captains towards Lu Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Captains. We will take the majority of the points obtained here. I hope for everyone to understand. After all, now’s the critical period for us to rush into the Top 8.” A smile appeared on Lu Tian’s face as he spoke out towards those few Captains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that, the few Captains hastily shook their heads, although their smiles grew slightly unnatural. Although they had relied on a powerful group like Lu Tian’s to obtain quite a bit of points during the most recent period of time, they would offer the most manpower while also suffering the greatest losses. Although no lives were lost, quite a few of their group members had serious injuries present on their bodies. Wanting to completely recover would require a considerable amount of time. As of now, with the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament already entering its final phase, waiting for those severely injured group members to fully recover might result in them missing out in this competition entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this large group, they had paid the highest price, yet seemingly half of the points would be taken away by Lu Tian’s group, while the other half being split equally among the other groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This clearly wasn’t too fair. Despite that, though, no one dared to speak about it. That’s because all of them were extremely well-aware of Lu Tian’s strength, with them lacking the qualifications to haggle with him. In this place, if they were to leave the protective envelope of Lu Tian, their ending might be all too similar to those few groups they were currently encircling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, even though they were extremely discontent towards the overbearingness of Lu Tian and his group, they did not dare to show the slightest bit of their true feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sweeping an indifferent look towards the few Captains with somewhat unnatural expressions on their face, Lu Tian proceeded to heedlessly retract his gaze back. Looking once again at the devastated area of sand below, he said, “It’s about time. Zhou Ya, go and settle the fellow that’s putting up the greatest resistance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Captain.” A smile cracked open from a youth behind Lu Tian as he gave his reply, before locking his chilling gaze towards the ground below. Presently, there was a group that was putting up an especially intense resistance, with numerous attacks being blocked by them. The leader of this group seemed to possess a similar realm of cultivation at First Grade Spirit Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This youth by the name of Zhou Ya walked out, before descending towards the direction of the group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Zhou Ya descended, the group being locked onto had also felt the impending threat, Them drawing closer to one another, ugly expressions appeared on their faces as they stared right at the descending Zhou Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do… Captain?” In the locked on group, a few group members asked as they looked towards their Captain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Captain had a somewhat sturdy built, while his face appeared slightly familiar. If Mu Chen was present, he would be shocked to find out that this person was actually the group from the Desolation Spiritual Academy that he had bumped into not long after the start of the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for this person, he seemed to be known as Lin Zhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had even obtained the information of the branch palace of the Divine Wood Palace from them, before collaborating to enter and search for the treasures. The two parties had merely parted ways after the end of the treasure search. They never imagined that they would actually have quite an improvement to their cultivation upon entering the central region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this very moment, Lin Zhou appeared to be in a slightly miserable state, his gaze that was staring right at Zhou Ya was being filled with dread and fear. Although he had similarly managed to successfully pass the First Grade Spirit Disaster, Lin Zhou knew that he was just lucky to pass it a while ago. As for Zhou Ya descending towards him, the latter’s strength was already close to making contact with Second Grade Spirit Disaster. He was simply not a challenge for the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, there were even more powerful figures hovering in the sky above that were covetously eyeing them, especially the Captain of the Heavens Spiritual Academy, Lu Tian, who was an extremely formidable character.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hand over your Academy Plaque. We just want your points and not to hurt people. However, if we are to really head to that stage, we won’t mind doing it,” said Zhou Ya in an indifferent voice as he extended his hands towards Lin Zhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These points have been painstaking accumulated by us! If it's taken away by you just like that, how am I going to account to everyone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lin Zhou’s voice rang out, Zhou Ya’s face turned completely dark, as powerful Spiritual Energy swept out from him. With a stomp, his figure appeared right before Lin Zhou in a spectre-like fashion.</span></p>

His palm was suffused with a white gem-like luster, while one could faintly discern the white bones beneath the flesh and blood present, casting an exceedingly peculiar sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a fierce attack caused Lin Zhou’s face to change. Hastily revolving all of the Spiritual Energy within his body, he immediately sent a fist rumbling out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmph!</span></p>

Carving out a hundred-plus metre long scar on the ground, and could not help spurting a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Captain!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all are attempting to do the impossible.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!</span></p>

The robes covering their chests had shattered, while a deep bloody palm print appeared within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Zhou’s face instantly turned ashen as he saw what had happened. Struggling to stand up, a vicious expression appeared in his eyes as he stared at Zhou Ya, who was now slowly walking over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now, are you planning to hand over the points or not?” said Zhou Ya as he stared indifferently at the already exhausted and dispirited Lin Zhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all have been chasing after us for three days… isn’t this too overbearing?!” Lin Zhou roared back in fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Childish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Laughing out, Zhou Ya shook his head before saying, “In this place, as long as you have enough strength, you’ll possess the qualifications to be absolutely unrestrained in how overbearing you want to display. Naturally, if you have an ample solid background or compatriots, we might fear you for an instant. However… will a group like your’s have those?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ridicule and disdain was present on the smile curling from the corner of Zhou Ya’s mouth. Truthfully speaking, the strength of Lin Zhou’s group wasn’t considered to be that strong. Therefore, Zhou Ya did not believe that they would have any friendly relationship with any of the heavyweight groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, even if that was the case, so what? His Captain was a person that had a friendly relationship with an expert like Ji Xuan, who was the current Numero Uno on the point rankings. Placed within the entire central region, who wouldn’t give them any face?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, the expressions of Lin Zhou and his group turned sluggish, while their eyes started to gradually turn dim. Being clear about themselves, among the groups they had a collaborative relationship with, there was not a single one that could compare to the Heavens Spiritual Academy’s groups present before their eyes. After all, the latter and his group were placed highly on the current point rankings. Within the entire Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, there truly weren’t too many groups that would be able to surpass them in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for those experts that were able to surpass Lu Tian and his group, why in the world would they see anything in their group at all?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The nonsense ends here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the sunken Lin Zhou, Zhou Ya proceeded to take a step forward, with his palm hurtling towards the former’s chest at lightning speed. The tyrannical Spiritual Energy condensed within that palm caused Lin Zhou’s body to turn still, with him not daring to show the slightest bit of movement. At this moment, the smile at the corner of Zhou Ya’s mouth turned into a chilling one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s extremely unfortunate, but I have to tell you that you’ve lost your last chance. Therefore…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a tremble shook through his palm, tyrannical Spiritual Energy gushed from Zhou Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, Lin Zhou closed his eyes in despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. If you’re smart enough, this palm will not go down. If not, even your Captain, Lu Tian, would not be able to save you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at the instant when Zhou Ya was about to do the deed, a clear and somewhat familiar sound of laughter rang out in an unhurried fashion. The voice appeared to be neither far nor near, yet it caused a tremble to shake through Lin Zhou’s body as he furiously snapped his eyes open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next instant, what he saw on the sand not far away were figures slowly walking over. Present in their lead was an exceedingly familiar-looking figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That… was Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon taking in this sight, Lin Zhou’s eyes grew increasingly wipe open.</span></p>
