 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One month ago, practically no one knew about Lin Ming’s name. But today, his infamous name was comparable to all the pinnacle experts here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because, amongst the Commanders that fought him in the past, aside from Zhantai Liuli, practically everyone had lost their ability to control Battle Will and were reduced to cripples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing such a ruthless outcome, he was practically the most feared amongst the Battle Will geniuses in the Fallen Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because they were clear that if they were crippled of their talent to control Battle Will, then their status in their force would fall. It was a terrifying outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when everyone saw Lin Ming stepping out, their eyelids had slightly twitched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under everyone’s fearful and hateful gazes, Lin Ming stood beside the Heavenly Evil King and looked at Asura King, before he faintly smiled. “Asura King, I’m afraid that the outcome of you speaking such ferocious words for us both to suffer casualties isn’t as effective. That’s because it is a consequence that none of us is willing to bear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Asura King’s eyes flashed with a coldness as he indifferently looked at Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys are somewhat resourceful in the current situation of being able to pull along the Myriad Saint Peak and Demon Gate to stand with you guys. It looks like it’s impossible to encircle your Great Havenlaw Domain anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming turned his head and his venomous gaze was shot towards Mu Chen, who stood behind the Asura King. He waved his hand and a Battle Will soared into the sky, forming into chains that bound a figure that stood at the centre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking a closer look, it was the unconscious Glacier King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But if you guys want to save him, that’ll depend on how capable you guys are!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming hung his eyes low as he continued, “I have already said my words. So don’t threaten me with the battle. The Glacier King is now in my hands, it’s easy for me to kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After killing him, if your Great Havenlaw Domain wants to start a war, my Netherworld Palace isn’t a weakling that you guys can crush. At that time, we’ll see who can laugh till the end.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming was also a decisive person, and he knew that both sides would have to pay a great price if a war occured. And the Great Havenlaw Domain was probably still not decisive enough to pay that sort of price for the Glacier King alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent surged in the Asura King’s eyes. Looking at Lin Ming, his gaze was showed that he wanted to devour the latter and a terrifying oppression of a Seventh Grade Sovereign slowly spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before the Asura King’s rage erupted, he was stopped by Mu Chen. The two of them exchanged a look and the Asura King deeply inhaled a mouthful of air, before suppressing the rage in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen went up and every gaze in the region fixed onto him as whispers resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the new King Mu of the Great Havenlaw Domain? With his strength at Fifth Grade Sovereign, he’s just a tail seat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What joke, didn’t you know that, in the Death Ruin, Mu Chen lead the Great Havenlaw Domain and became the biggest winner? Not only did he cripple the hand of Xiao Tian, who’s from the Sky Profound Palace, even Zhantai Liuli, whose fame had been surging recently, suffered in his hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s said that Mu Chen is also a Battle Formation Master. I wonder who’s strong, him or Lin Ming?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All sorts of discussions were spreading &nbsp;out in this region, which made Xiao Tian’s face, who stood behind Liu Yan of the Sky Profound Palace, to turn pale. Especially the gaze of the latter looking at Mu Chen. He looked like he wanted to tear him apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the contrary, Zhantai Liuli had a calm expression as she looked at Mu Chen. She could vaguely sense that compared to their first meeting, Mu Chen had become even more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, his strength had undergone a huge increase in the past month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Ming has also obtained the inheritance of a Battle Formation Master, and his method of cultivating will is extremely bizarre. In this period of time, his will has been constantly growing and is a great enemy. I’m not sure how much of chance Mu Chen has to win.” Zhantai Liuli’s gaze flickered. She had once fought with Lin Ming, so she knew how powerful the latter was. Back then, if it wasn’t for her obtaining the full inheritance of the Battle Formation Emperor, it’d be hard for her to fight Lin Ming to the point of a tie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crucial part was that along with Lin Ming constantly searching for Battle Will geniuses as his targets recently, his will seemed to have grown stronger, which Zhantai Liuli was fearful of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under all the discussions, Lin Ming squinted his eyes as he looked at Mu Chen’s silhouette with a smile-yet-not-a-smile arc hung on his lips. “You’re the so-called ‘Battle Will genius’ of the Great Havenlaw Domain, Mu Chen, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Lin Ming’s eerie gaze, Mu Chen calmly smiled. “Speak your intentions. Although my Great Havenlaw Domain is fearful of the price for an all-out war, that goes the same for you guys as well. In-which perhaps you or even the Heavenly Evil King is not capable of bearing the consequences.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming gave a slightly playful smile. “Looks like your an understanding person. I heard that in the Death Ruin, you captured a troop of the Divine Pavilion, which got the Divine Pavilion to pay an extortion for the troop, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen’s black pupils flashed with a hint of a chill. This Lin Ming was truly vicious to let their Great Havenlaw Domain use Fallen Origin Pellets to exchange for the hostage. Clearly, this method was to humiliate their Great Havenlaw Domain before everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the direction of the Divine Pavilion, when Fang Yi heard those words, he instantly eerily looked at Mu Chen and spat a mouthful of air in joy as he sneered, “Mu Chen, every dog has its day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Regardless, Glacier King is a Sixth Grade Sovereign expert. How about your Great Havenlaw Domain redeem him with 200,000 Fallen Origin Pellets?” Lin Ming smiled with his eyes squinted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death!” The Mountain Splitting King and the rest started with their eyes widened as they barked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Asura King also had a pale face as he darkly looked at Lin Ming. If it wasn’t for Lin Ming having the Heavenly Evil King, who was on the same level as him, he would have taken actions to kill Lin Ming long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the other forces were inwardly smacking their lips at the Netherworld Palace. If the Great Havenlaw Domain truly paid the price of 200,000 Fallen Origin Pellets, that would practically be their harvest of Fallen Origin Pellets in this period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Netherworld Palace probably has no intention of handing the person over. They’re just trying to humiliate the Great Havenlaw Domain. This way, they can also help the Divine Pavilion get back their humiliation during the Death Ruin. They can both oppress the Great Havenlaw Domain while getting on the good side with the Divine Pavilion, killing two birds with one stone.” Some ruler of their forces inwardly sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Gate and Myriad Saint Peak did not speak. Strictly speaking, they weren’t allied with the Great Havenlaw Domain. The reason why they stood out to support the Great Havenlaw Domain was due to the grudges they had with the other forces. Furthermore, they did not wish to see the Divine Pavilion and Netherworld Palace, who they had grudges with, annihilate the Great Havenlaw Domain so easily. That way, they would practically be the next target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they were willing to help the Great Havenlaw Domain if they did not have to pay a significant price. But if it exceeded their ability, then they could only watch from the sidelines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. What do you think of this ransom sum? If you guys don’t want to pay it, then you guys can go ahead and leave. But the moment you guys turn around, the Glacier King’s soul will return to the Netherworld.” Lin Ming chuckled as he looked at Mu Chen and an eerie smile rose on his thin lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, just as some of the lords of the other forces expected. They practically did not expect the Great Havenlaw Domain to pay such a pricy ransom. But if the Great Havenlaw Domain really turned around, then Lin Ming had meant to dirty the name of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s black pupils were cold as he cast a glance at Lin Ming, before retracting his gaze. His lips gently wriggled as he transmitted his voice with Spiritual Energy towards the other Kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the moment they came to the Bones Mountain Range, they were already in the Netherworld Palace’s trap. If they turned around right now, it would definitely be a great blow to the reputation of their Great Havenlaw Domain, which was something that the Netherworld Palace was willing to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were already at a disadvantage from the moment the Glacier King was captured by the other party, thus losing the initiative. So it wouldn’t be easy for them to turn the tables around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Mu Chen, when the Kings heard his voice, their enraged faces gradually calmed down, but there were still worries hanging on their faces. That’s because Mu Chen’s intention was a little dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, no matter which way they took, they would be falling into the other party’s schemes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Asura King’s gaze flickered, before nodding his head. “Mu Chen, as long as you’re confident, you can handle this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen inwardly felt relieved, before cupping his hands towards the Asura King. “I will definitely do my best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then turned around and directed his sharp gaze towards Lin Ming. When the latter saw his gaze, the latter’s brows gently twitched as he sneered, “So? Are you done with your discussion? Can you tell me your decision? Will you pay the ransom, or leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at Lin Ming and a smile appeared. “200,000 Fallen Origin Pellets? Sure, my Great Havenlaw Domain will pay!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he spoke, every single force in this region was astonished. The Divine Pavilion, Demon Gate, Sky Profound Palace and the other peak forces were all somewhat dumbfounded. They never expected Mu Chen to actually pay 200,000 Fallen Origin Pellets to exchange for the Glacier King. Didn’t they know the importance of the Fallen Origin Pellets? If the Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury opened and they did not have enough Fallen Origin Pellets to break the seal, then would the Great Havenlaw Ruler forgive them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only them, but even Lin Ming had squinted his eyes, before eerily smiling a moment later. “How courageous. Then I’d have to trouble you to hand over the Fallen Origin Pellets!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will naturally hand the Fallen Origin Pellets over…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at Lin Ming as the corner of his lips rose into an arc. “But, since you guys want to play, why don’t we play something bigger? Or is your Netherworld Palace a bunch of trash that only knows how to use petty means like a mouse? Or is a nameless mouse like you not courageous enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mu Chen’s words were casually spoken, they were undoubtedly like claps of thunder that made every expert from the Netherworld Palace enraged. Lin Ming’s face had also distorted as the thing that he hated the most was someone calling him a nameless figure. Although it was the truth, it was due to him enduring it that he could become a Battle Formation Master. Just for this day, he had endured too many humiliations. So, after he finally became a Battle Formation Master, how was he willing to endure such humiliation again!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Lin Ming had deeply inhaled a breath, before looking at Mu Chen and the smile that hung on the corner of his lips gradually turned vicious. “No matter how you want to play, my Netherworld Palace will accompany you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point in time, Mu Chen had also cut off the path of retreat for the Netherworld Palace. If they did not agree to it, then the one to have their reputation ruined today would be them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard Lin Ming’s words, his gaze instantly turned sharp as he raised his head and pointed towards Lin Ming. Every single one of his words rumbled like thunder that resounded in everyone’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You and I battle, the one that loses will pay 400,000 Fallen Origin Pellets!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he spoke those words, countless experts inhaled a mouthful of chilled air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was truly vicious to push both parties to a path of no retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the Netherworld Palace had truly kicked a metal plate!</span></p>
