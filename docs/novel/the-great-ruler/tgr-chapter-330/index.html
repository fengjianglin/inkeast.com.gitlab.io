 <p><strong>Chapter 330 - The End</strong></p>
 <p>On the two giant peaks, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong respectively looked towards Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan. As of now, the expressions on their faces were undeniably much more relaxed than before, stemming from their self-confidence.</p>
 <p>Although Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan weren’t so easy to deal with that even Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong were not daring to even say they were absolutely able to defeat them, to them, achieving a draw in such a fight wasn’t something difficult.</p>
 <p>Of the three fights, Mu Chen had already won one. Even if they were to both draw, or lose one fight, in the end, they would still achieve victory.</p>
 <p>Naturally, losing one match was something that they would obviously not do. In front of them, Mu Chen had become so miserable just to achieve a win. If they were to lose, they would truly be unable to explain themselves in front of all the students.</p>
 <p>Looking at each other in the eyes, Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan both gave helpless laughs. They never imagined that the final checkpoint would come to such a stage…</p>
 <p>In the surroundings of the Spiritual Light Mountain, the cheering sounds that had lasted for quite a while gradually grew softer as everyone looked excitedly at the confrontations happening on the other two giant peaks. With the advantage on their side, after Mu Chen’s victory, they had already seemingly won half of the final fight.</p>
 <p>As long as no aberrations happened during Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong’s fight, victory would definitely be theirs.</p>
 <p>Looking at the scene before him, Mu Chen finally relaxed his body completely. What happened after this was already none of his concern. He had already done what he was able to do, and he had completely achieved his goal.</p>
 <p>Upon completely relaxing, the weakness of his body instantly surfaced from the depths, causing him to stagger and stumble.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a clear and beautiful fragrance blossomed from behind him as Luo Li appeared beside him. Without any scruples on the blood that covered his entire body, her white and slender hands supported Mu Chen’s body, before resting him on her lovable body.</p>
 <p>As Luo Li supported Mu Chen, she looked at the heart-wrenching injuries present on his body. These were all caused by the black lightning’s energy, causing them to look extremely horrifying. For the sake of enduring such power, Mu Chen had shouldered an extreme amount of pain and suffering.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?” asked Luo Li softly, concern flashing within her clear and limpid eyes. Although she was not willing to have Mu Chen engage in such life-threatening fights and earnestly wished to help him, she knew…that she couldn’t interfere in these kinds of matters. It wasn’t a question of the dignity of a male, but a responsibility.</p>
 <p>This was the responsibility that Mu Chen had embraced, and he needed to face it by himself. Similarly, he would not wish for anyone to interfere and take action, including her.</p>
 <p>Smiling, Mu Chen extended his hand to embrace Luo Li’s slender waist, with his body seemingly pasted on her soft and delicate body. At this moment, his body would faintly tremble from time to time, originating from the intense pain radiating from within his body. These tremors were extremely minute, causing others to be unable to discover them. Luo Li was only able to feel them when he rested on her, causing her to feel even more concern for him.</p>
 <p>“Everything that happens from now is of no concern to me.” said Mu Chen while looking at the two giant peaks in the distance. Regardless of the results of the final fights, he was unable to interfere at all.</p>
 <p>“You’ve already completed the most important part. There shouldn’t be much more suspense in the following two fights.” Luo Li said with a slight smile as she continued, “Congratulations. As of now, you’ve truly become an influential character at the peak of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t care about such things.” replied Mu Chen as he stared at Luo Li’s beautiful and exquisite face, before continuing to say slowly, “ For me, you came to the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. This has already consumed your training time. Although I’ve done nothing about this, I can at least do my utmost to reduce your losses…I don’t care about other people getting their Spiritual Light Empowerment; however, that’s something that you definitely need to have.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Luo Li gawked. Looking at the youth, although, he had some bloodstains on his face, it was still as handsome and dashing. A slightly acidic feeling rose on her small nose. <em>Was this the reason why you would risk your life…?</em></p>
 <p>“I don’t think that I’ve lost anything. On the contrary, during these past few years, especially the time within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, I’ve never felt more happiness in my entire life.” said Luo Li gently as a gentle and beautiful smile blossomed on her face.</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Mu Chen smiled as the arm wrapped around Luo Li’s waist slowly grew tighter, seemingly as though he wanted to sink her into his body.</p>
 <p>As Mu Chen continued to enjoy the gentle and fragrant embrace, under the gazes of countless people, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong slowly took a step forward on the two giant peaks.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Boundless Spiritual Energy shot through the skies as the pressure coming from the two strong Spiritual Energies flooded out. Instantly, the entire stretch of the sky was enveloped under the Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiating from the two.</p>
 <p>Obviously, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had already prepared to use their full strength in their fights.</p>
 <p>Contrary to expectations, facing the strong Spiritual Energy pressing down on them, the expressions on Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan still remained calm and unchanged.</p>
 <p>“Senior Brother Lin Zhen.”</p>
 <p>“Senior Brother Qingshan.”</p>
 <p>Cupping their hands at the same time, both Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong roared in a low voice, “Please give your guidance!”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As they roared, the expression within the eyes of the two instantly became fierce and sharp. Stomping their feet on the ground, their figures instantly shot out as the Spiritual Energy that hid the skies and blotted the earth rapidly converged together.</p>
 <p>Looking at the two shooting towards them with fierce fighting intent erupting from them, Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan shot a look at each other. After helplessly shrugging their shoulders, they made a move. Unexpectedly, out of everyone’s expectations, they had taken a step back.</p>
 <p>Facing the attacks of Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, they had unexpectedly retreated?</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Clamoring noises instantly resounded across the world. Although Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong were strong, they were obviously incapable of scaring Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan away.</p>
 <p>Feeling somewhat shocked, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong both halted in their steps. Looking at the two who had retreated and unable to detect the faintest traces of fighting intent from them, they started to wrinkle their brows, obviously unable to understand their intent.</p>
 <p>Facing the doubtful stares coming their way, Lin Zheng gave a helpless smile and said, “There’s no need to continue fighting.”</p>
 <p>“For this last checkpoint, let’s consider it your win.” said Zhou Qingshan while shrugging his shoulders.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing their replies, both Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong gawked, something which was replicated by all of the students around the Spiritual Light Mountain. A split second later, furious sounds of cheering that shook the skies erupted out.</p>
 <p>Lin Zhen and Zhou Qingshan had actually admitted defeat on their own accord!</p>
 <p>That would mean that they have passed through the last checkpoint! All of them would obtain their Spiritual Light Empowerment! Their year’s worth of bitter training wasn’t wasted!</p>
 <p>“They’ve given up, huh…?” Mu Chen also felt somewhat shocked. However, it was too much of a surprise for him. Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan were obviously not weak. However, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong were not the slightest bit weaker than them. Even if the former two were to utilise all of their cards, they might only be able to achieve an evenly matched situation. However, this kind of result would already be unable to create the slightest bit of change in the entire situation.</p>
 <p>Of the three fights, Mu Chen had won his, while Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had both achieved draws. Therefore, once this result was out, it was already unable to be changed. Since that was the case, there was simply no point for this confrontation to continue.</p>
 <p>However, Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan’s straightforwardness was something that made Mu Chen feel slightly intrigued. He had assumed that they would cross hands for at least an exchange before choosing to give up on the fight. He never imagined that the fight would be over before it even began…</p>
 <p>Obviously, both Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong were having the same thoughts as Mu Chen, since their jaws were slightly hanging down. Not only did everyone have a feeling that they had no choice but to withdraw due to this unexpected turn of events, it truly made people fall into a bad mood.</p>
 <p>They were originally planning to enjoy the fights to their hearts content. However, they never thought that Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan would not give them such a chance…</p>
 <p>“So, this ends like that, huh?” said Shen Cangsheng as he restrained the boundless Spiritual Energy radiating from him.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Lin Zheng smiled in acknowledgement. With a flick of his finger, a ray of Spiritual Energy shot towards the sky, before exploding in midair. In the next moment, as the surrounding space started to faintly distort, two old figures slowly appeared from within.</p>
 <p>Upon them appearing, a hoarse voice rang out, “Since Lin Zheng and Zhou Qingshan have given up, the victors for the final fight goes to the side of the students. According to the rules, all of the students will be able to obtain the chance of Spiritual Light Empowerment.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the final verdict of the two Elders, countless students reacted instantly by emotionally cheering out loud.</p>
 <p>Waiting for the cheering voices to gradually decline, the two Elders turned towards Mu Chen, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong and said, “You three have achieved victory in the final fights; therefore, you three will get your deserved rewards.”</p>
 <p>One of the Elders waved his sleeve, causing three bright and resplendent rays of light to shoot out, before transforming into three clumps of light in front of them. Within the clumps of light, one was able to see approximately three metres tall clear and sparkling Spirit Crystals. There seemed to be liquid slowly flowing within them, and they radiated with extremely strong and pure Spiritual Energy fluctuations.</p>
 <p>These were Spirit Crystals of Spirit King level. Furthermore, from the thickness of the Spiritual Energy present, it was clearly much stronger than the Spirit Crystal that Mu Chen had obtained from killing the Spirit King from before.</p>
 <p>“The Spiritual Light Empowerment the three of you will receive is different from the rest of the students. After three days, head to the Punishment Hall. There will be Elders there who will personally take action to help with your Spiritual Light Empowerment.” said one of the Elders with a smile.</p>
 <p>Hearing the Elder’s words, the students in the surroundings were casting envious gazes towards them. However, all of them knew that this was something that Mu Chen and the other two deserved. Without them, all of the people there would have already lost their qualifications to undergo the Spiritual Light Empowerment.</p>
 <p>Looking at the clear and sparkling Spirit Crystal in front of him, Mu Chen faintly hesitated, before asking, “Elders, would it be possible to transfer such a Spiritual Light Empowerment to another person?”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Mu Chen’s question, Luo Li’s beautiful face faintly changed, before instantly being suppressed by Mu Chen’s glare.</p>
 <p>The two Elders had also gawked upon hearing his question, before they turned and shot a look at Mu Chen and Luo Li. From the looks of it, they seemed to have some inkling of understanding, since they replied with a faint smile, “It’s not only you three that are entitled to such a special Spiritual Light Empowerment. There’s another criteria that can be fulfilled to obtain it, which is to obtain a complete Spirit Crystal of the Spirit King. Only when one has one of these would this criteria be fulfilled.”</p>
 <p>With a thought, he immediately brought out his half of the Spirit Crystal of the Spirit King out. Luo Li had also fished her half out. Placing the two halves together, they seamlessly fused together.</p>
 <p>Extending her jade-like hands, Luo Li received the completed Spirit Crystal. With the gentle light radiating from it, it caused her youthful and absolutely beautiful face to appear exceptionally soul-stirring.</p>
 <p>“Elders, would this be alright?” Mu Chen asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, for the Spiritual Light Empowerment, the more Spirit Crystals, the greater its effect.” seeing Mu Chen handing over half of a Spirit Crystal to Luo Li without the slightest hint of hesitation, the two Elders could not help feeling slightly surprised before speaking their thoughts.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen declined to comment on their words. Although the Spiritual Light Empowerment was admittedly important, in his eyes, it was clearly not the slightest bit as important as Luo Li.</p>
 <p>Tugging her slender and jade-like hand against Mu Chen’s palm, a gentle ripple undulated within Luo Li’s clear and limpid eyes as she stared at him.</p>
 <p>After seeing Mu Chen’s determination, the two Elders did not continue to say anymore. Retracting their gazes, a strong and vigorous voice resounded in the ears of every single student.</p>
 <p>“Since the results of the final fight are known, I will now announce that this hunt is officially over!”</p>
 <p>As the last of his words rang out, countless rays of bright and resplendent light erupted erratically from the horizon. As they shot out, everyone was enveloped under their light.</p>
 <p>Under the envelopment of the light, Mu Chen unfurled his hands and looked towards the expansive space before him. Instantly exhaling a deep breath of relief, he was finally able to exit from there.</p>
