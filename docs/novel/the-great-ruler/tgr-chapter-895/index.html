 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>

Strong whizzing gales resounded throughout this region before everyone was shocked to see streaks of light sweeping out from the ruin towards every direction. It was an extremely spectacular formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The forces of the Great Havenlaw domain are actually out. Looks like the treasures of the Death Ruin have fallen into their hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the appearance of this huge batch, there were countless whispers of envy resounding outside the Death Ruin. There were some with their eyes turning red. But due to the power of the Great Havenlaw Domain, no one dared to reveal their greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party, Mu Chen stood on the sky, casting a glance outside the ruin before giving another glance towards the Death Ruin. Behind him, the Sky Profound Palace and Divine Pavilion were closely following after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are we really going to release them?” Nine Nether asked in a deep voice beside Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we don’t, then I’m afraid that Liu Yan will go insane.” Mu Chen smiled, then his gaze flickered shortly after. He waved his hand towards the boundless Battle Will that ruthlessly enveloped the Sky Profound Division.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle Will exploded and shrieks resounded in the sky before everyone became dumbfounded and saw a surge of Battle Will enveloping Xiao Tian, before it turned into a streak of light and shot towards the northwest direction like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Battle Will had fully exhausted, Xiao Tian was already thrown a few hundred miles away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After making a mess of the current situation, Mu Chen waved his hand without any hesitation and flew out with the Great Havenlaw Domain’s party. They pushed their speed to the limits and had disappeared into the horizon in just a few breaths’ time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with their departure, a commotion occurred in the Death Ruin, with the Sky Profound Palace and the Divine Pavilion having rushed out as well. When Liu Yan saw the groaning Sky Profound Division, which filled the mountains, before looking in the direction that Xiao Tian was thrown at, his face was pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gather the Sky Profound Division and rescue Xiao Tian!” Liu Yan gritted his teeth. Mu Chen was truly cunning. Their Sky Profound Palace would be busy this way and they could not pursue them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another direction, the morale of the Divine Pavilion’s party was dispirited, with Fang Yi and the Lords all having dark expressions. On this trip to the Death Ruin, the Great Havenlaw Domain was clearly the biggest winner. If this matter was to spread out, then their Divine Pavilion would undoubtedly be a laughing stock in the Hunting War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t let them off so easily! Our reinforcements will soon arrive, so we’ll go hold them up. We must definitely let them spit out whatever that they have taken!” Fang Yi spoke with a dark face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Lords heard his words, they did not respond to him like they did in the past. On the contrary, they had all looked at Zhantai Liuli and the meaning behind that was evident. They wanted to listen to Zhantai Liuli’s opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing their gazes, Zhantai Liuli briefly pondered, before shaking her head, “Even if we have reinforcements, who knows whether there will be reinforcements from the Great Havenlaw Domain as well? I’m still injured so I can’t bring out the full strength of the Azure Troop, whereas the other troops have suffered being hostages, so their morale is low. It’s practically impossible for them to fight. So, if we catch up to them, our chances of winning aren’t high…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Lords heard her words, they only nodded their heads. After all, what Zhantai Liuli had said made sense. Their current situation wasn’t optimistic, while the Sky Profound Palace had their hands tied on their own matters, not having any interest in cooperating with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are we going to let them leave just like that?” Fang Yi was enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Fang doesn’t need to be anxious. The Hunting War has not ended yet, and it was just a failure in the previous confrontation. Furthermore, we did not return completely empty-handed. I believe that the next time we meet, I will be able to become a genuine Battle Formation Master. At that time, I will definitely deal with Mu Chen myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Zhantai Liuli’s words, the countenances of the Lords changed and they looked at Zhantai Liuli’s exquisite face with shock, before involuntarily saying, “Great Commander Zhantai can become a Battle Formation Master?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t at fault to be so shocked. After all, there were too few Battle Formation Masters in this world, and the might that they possessed would intimidate innumerable experts. To their Divine Pavilion, a Battle Formation Master was undoubtedly a strategic-class weapon. The intimidation possessed by a Battle Formation Master was something that they were inferior to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. Great Commander Zhantai is truly a genius. From today onward, I’m afraid that our Divine Pavilion will be the first to produce a Battle Formation Master. In this Hunting War, Great Commander will definitely be able to exhibit your splendour and intimidate everyone.” The Lords recovered from their shock and had cupped their hands together. Compared to before, their smiles were much warmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because they understood how high Zhantai Liuli’s status would rise in the Divine Pavilion. At that time, even Fang Yi would be outshined by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that strength, Zhantai Liuli was capable being on the same level as them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing beside them, Fang Yi was also stunned and he could only swallow his dissatisfaction with Zhantai Liuli. If it was in the past, he was confident that his own status would be slightly higher than Zhantai Liuli. After all, her own cultivation wasn’t that strong, since it was only at the Fourth Grade Sovereign Realm. Furthermore, she had heavily relied on the resources of the Divine Pavilion so that it would be easier for her to command the troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The investments of those resources were to assist Zhantai Liuli to become a Battle Formation Master. Right now, the Divine Pavilion’s investment had succeeded so Zhantai Liuli’s status would undergo a huge change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli looked at the sudden changes on everyone’s faces and she slightly smiled. “Everyone doesn’t have to be so anxious. We will temporarily hold up this grudge. The crucial factor of the Hunting War is not here…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lords all nodded their heads. Indeed, the crucial factor of this Hunting War wasn’t here but the upper hierarchy of both sides. If their Pavilion Master could make a breakthrough in the current Hunting War, then his strength could suppress the rulers of the other forces. At that time, the Divine Pavilion would be able to become the strongest peak force in the Northern Region, or they might even be able to take another step forth…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just thinking about it, the indignance in their hearts calmed down. By that time, when the Great Havenlaw Domain was annihilated by their Divine Pavilion, the life of Mu Chen and the rest would be hanging on their thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that everyone was pacified, Zhantai Liuli no longer had any intention of staying and had cast a glance at the warriors of the Sky Profound Division that the Sky Profound Palace was still gathering, before turning into a streak of light and flew towards the north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind her, the party of the Divine Pavilion swiftly followed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan looked at the Divine Pavilion, who had not spoken a word and left, and his face became slightly dark. But in the end, he still looked at the direction that Mu Chen had left in and eerily said, “Mu Chen, you have completely offended the Divine Pavilion and they will definitely not let this matter rest. At that time, I’ll let the two tigers fight while my Sky Profound Palace fishes for benefits!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Great Havenlaw Domain will definitely be annihilated in this Hunting War!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Liu Yan darkly cursed, Mu Chen was already far from the Death Ruin. After confirming that it was completely safe for them, only then did they slow down their advance, before searching for a remote mountain range and hid the massive troops within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had experienced numerous bitter battles in the Death Ruin. Although experts like them could still bear it, their troops were completely exhausted and it was tough for them to continue to rush their journey. So they had temporarily chosen to rest here.</span></p>

They were calculating their harvest in this trip to the Death Ruin. When the results were out, everyone couldn’t help rejoicing.</span></p>

Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to obtain such a huge amount of Fallen Origin Pellets and we might have had to suffer considerable casualties.” The Spiritual Sword King looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>

Even the Blood Hawk King, who wasn’t too fond of Mu Chen in the past, had nodded his head with a smile. After experiencing all these situations, even veteran Kings like them couldn’t help admiring Mu Chen a little more in their hearts.</span></p>

She seemed to have sensed something as a smear of amazement flashed in her eyes. “What have you obtain in the Death Ruin?”</span></p>

They had all exchanged a look and they could see the shock in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
