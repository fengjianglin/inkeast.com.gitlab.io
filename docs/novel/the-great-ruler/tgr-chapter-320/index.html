 <p><strong>Chapter 320 - Descent of the Divine Crane</strong></p>
 <p>The cold, chilling air diffused out, covering the entire world, and caused the temperature of the surrounding skies and earth to plummet. The air had seemingly condensed into ice threads. Even the Spiritual Energy circulating between the heavens and earth had started to become sluggish.</p>
 <p>Everyone looked in shock at the gigantic figure that had formed on the starry sky behind Mu Chen. It was a giant beast that was fully clad in a jet-black colour. Possessing the shape of a tortoise, it quietly crept forward. At its rear, its tail comprised of a long, giant black python. As the giant python stared out, it revealed its head, while a jet black tongue flickered out from its mouth.</p>
 <p>As it crept forward from the starry sky, a black wave swept from it. A crashing sound that looked as though it had substance resounded across the sky.</p>
 <p>Divine Seal of Black Tortoise.</p>
 <p>It was the second Divine Seal within the Four Gods Constellation Scripture. After obtaining this Deity Tier Spiritual Art for such a long time, Mu Chen finally displayed the second Divine Seal successfully.</p>
 <p>This Deity Tier Spiritual Art had finally started to reveal the brilliance that was worthy of its title.</p>
 <p>As he stood erected in the air, Mu Chen raised his head and looked towards the gigantic beast that had stepped out of the starry sky behind him. In the next instant, he waved his sleeve, as a chilling voice rang out, “Go.”</p>
 <p>Moo!</p>
 <p>The Black Tortoise made a long roar, causing the black tidal wave to instantaneously sweep out. Stepping on the wave, it seemingly transformed into a thousand meter long gigantic black water pillar. Carrying along extremely terrifying chilling air, under the shocked gazes of numerous people, it brazenly smashed head-on against the jade-coloured feather blade that was furiously chopping down!</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>At the instant of the collision, the entire sky seemed to have twisted and distorted. In the next instant, an ear splittingly giant sound rang across the horizon, as the black wave, as well as the jade-coloured glowing blade, swept across the entire stretch of the world.</p>
 <p>As for Mu Chen and He Yao, it was obvious that both of them had to bear the brunt of the fall out. The incomparably erratic Spiritual Energy storm rumbled directly towards them. At this instant, the faces of the two turned seemingly pale, as they were engulfed within.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was directly shot towards a mountain peak, his body laying embedded on the mountain cliff. Cracks extended, as the mountain cliff shattered, causing stones to crumble and descend.</p>
 <p>Struggling to stand up, Mu Chen wiped the blood stains at the corner of his mouth off. Thousands of metres away, He Yao was also in a completely miserable state, as more than half of his outfit was ripped into shreds. His face was alternating between green and pale, while bloodstains had similarly appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>On the ground, countless gazes looked towards the two that were flung back. They never thought that after the two had displayed such formidable Deity Tier Spiritual Arts, the both of them would still be evenly matched.</p>
 <p>“This Mu Chen truly is formidable! Even though He Yao exhibited his Deity Tier Spiritual Art, he still wasn’t able to gain any advantage!”</p>
 <p>“No wonder why he was able to kill a Spirit King. Looks like he should be the most dazzling dark horse in this hunt.”</p>
 <p>“Formidable!”</p>
 <p>Clamoring noises rang out as countless people in the region started to whisper and discuss. However, regardless of the topic of discussion, all of them had clearly regarded Mu Chan as outstanding. After all, He Yao was an influential figure at the apex of the academy. Furthermore, he was also a Senior, when compared to Mu Chen. According to normality, he should be the one that would suppress and defeat Mu Chen. However, as of now, he had not been able to gain any superiority against him. From a certain perspective, this was a lackluster performance.</p>
 <p>On one side of the platform, Su Ling'er, and the rest who had been observing, breathed a sigh of relief as they thought, <em>Mu Chen truly has hidden some moves. If not, the previous attack by He Yao might have already ended this fight.</em></p>
 <p>“This He Yao had already displayed the Divine Crane Art; however, he is still unable to gain any advantages over Mu Chen. Let’s see how he continues fighting!” Su Ling'er exclaimed.</p>
 <p>As long as Mu Chen doesn’t lose this fight, it would completely be considered his victory.</p>
 <p>Su Xuan wasn’t as optimistic as her sister. Her lovable face was still grave as she stared at He Yao, who was quietly cleaning the blood stains from the corner of his mouth as he stood in the air, his eyes turning more frightening and Su Xuan commented, “Don’t look down on He Yao. He isn’t someone that can be dealt with so easily.”</p>
 <p>As everyone’s gazes were focused towards the sky, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong shot look at Mu Chen with slight shock. Obviously, they felt astonished by how the latter was able to receive an attack from He Yao without letting him get a slightest degree of advantage.</p>
 <p>“The Deity Tier Spiritual Art that he displayed isn’t simple.” said Shen Cangsheng in a soft voice. His eyesight exceeded other people’s, and with a single look, he was able to discover the uncommonness of the Deity Tier Spiritual Art that Mu Chen had displayed.</p>
 <p>“It’s said that he had obtained it from the Spiritual Value Hall. According to my estimates, it might be a Middle Rank Deity Tier Spiritual Art.” Li Xuantong said. He had crossed hands with Mu Chen before; therefore, he already had some understanding towards the Four Divine Constellations Scripture.</p>
 <p>“A Middle Rank Deity Tier Spiritual Art?” muttered Shen Cangsheng, as the shock within his eyes became more evident. Within the Spiritual Values Hall, the number of Middle Rank Deity Tier Spiritual Arts could be counted with one’s fingers. Furthermore, the chances to obtain one was extremely small. Mu Chen’s luck was really that good?</p>
 <p>In addition, Shen Cangsheng was also clear that although Deity Tier Spiritual Arts were powerful, that did not mean that they were easy to learn and master. Even if some people were to get their hands on them, they would not be able to successfully learn and master those arts. For Mu Chen to be able to successfully learn this, it was not an easy feat to accomplish.</p>
 <p>“Being unable to deal with Mu Chen even after pulling this move out, He Yao’s shock must not be little.” commented Shen Cangsheng with a grin as he shot a look at He Yao in the distance.</p>
 <p>“This fellow has always been hiding his strength within the academy, and should be doing this to deal with me. If he only has such methods, he should not have such guts.” commented Li Xuantong with a faint smile before continuing, “Perhaps, he might have never thought that he would be forced by Mu Chen to such a point…”</p>
 <p>Turning his gaze towards Mu Chen in the distance, he continued his comment, “However, facing against Mu Chen, this does not seem to be considered as good news.”</p>
 <p>While the two of them were engaged in their conversation, at the distance, He Yao emotionlessly raised his head. His eyes looked towards Mu Chen with extreme darkness, as his palms scatter the broken pieces of clothing on his body, bit by bit.</p>
 <p>“I never thought that such a formidable Deity Tier Spiritual Art would be successfully learnt and practiced by you…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen gave a smile without saying anything; however, some vigilance slowly started to surface within his heart.</p>
 <p>“This was originally left for that fellow Li Xuantong. However, from the looks of it now, I’ve no other choice, but to use this to defeat you.” A smile started to rise from He Yao’s emotionless face; however, that very smile caused a cold shiver down everyone’s spines.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that, Mu Chen’s eyes faintly narrowed. In the next moment, the eyes that were staring at the body of He Yao’s suddenly contracted.</p>
 <p>As the robes on He Yao’s body were completely swept away by him, a blood-red rune surfaced on his chest. The blood-red seal seemed to be drawn by thick blood. Faintly, it seemed to form a blood-red imprint. The blood seemed extremely mysterious. Even though it had been exposed for so long, it still radiated a strong vitality, while the blood was even circulating at a slow rate.</p>
 <p>“That’s…” muttered Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, their gazes both converged on the symbol on He Yao’s chest that was formed by blood.</p>
 <p>“The fluctuations coming from it seem to be from the blood essence of a kind of spiritual beast. Furthermore, I’m afraid it might be one that is even ranked considerably high on the Myriad Beast Record.” said Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng softly nodded his head and said, “Looks a little bit like the blood essence of the Heavenly Demonic Crane…”</p>
 <p>“The Heavenly Demonic Crane, Ranked 26th on the Myriad Beast Record?” muttered Li Xuantong as he faintly raised his forehead, before replying, “I seem to have seen it in the Spiritual Values Hall, and it’s worth over 1,000,000 Spiritual Value Points. Looks like this He Yao had truly coughed out some blood just to deal with me.”</p>
 <p>“However, looks like it has given bad luck to Mu Chen…”</p>
 <p>The Mu Chen that they had deemed to be unlucky was now faintly wrinkling his forehead as he looked at the scene playing out before him. Although he was not overly clear as to what exactly He Yao wanted to do, he had also felt some taste of fear.</p>
 <p>At this moment, He Yao did not care about other people, and bent his head down to look at the blood imprint on his chest. Biting his fingers, fresh blood flowed out, causing his hands to be stained in red. In the next moment, his palms suddenly came together to form seals, while dazzling symbols fluctuated out as they appeared.</p>
 <p>Following the appearance of his hand seals, the blood imprint on his chest became an even darker blood-red color. In the next instant, it erupted with ear-piercing screeches, as the blood imprint extended. Quickly, it had already pervaded He Yao’s entire body.</p>
 <p>As of now, his eyes had slowly started to turn blood-red, bit by bit. An aura that caused people’s skin to feel numb started to radiate from his body. This made his appearance akin to a human-formed ferocious beast.</p>
 <p>“Divine Crane Art, Descent of the Divine Crane!”</p>
 <p>He Yao’s hoarse voice slowly rang out. As that happened, the skin across his entire body unexpectedly started to split apart. blood-red glowing feathers started to erupt from within his body, before finally completely encasing him.</p>
 <p>In such a short instant, He Yao’s appearance had a large change. blood-red feathers totally encased his entire body, with each of them being akin to a long and sharp sword, while an indescribable aura started to pervade out from him.</p>
 <p>At this time, He Yao had become extremely dangerous.</p>
 <p>Hiss!</p>
 <p>On the ground, countless gazes locked onto the greatly changed He Yao as everyone could not resist breathing in a mouthful of cold air. In the next instant, they took a step back as they thought, <em>What kind of Deity Tier Spiritual Art is that? Unexpectedly, such a frightening secret art existed?</em></p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, forcing me to such a step. You can only say that you’ve courted your own death. Next up, I’ll force you to scram!”</p>
 <p>He Yao’s blood-red eyes locked onto Mu Chen as blood-red light gushed out from his body. It seemed to transform into a incomparably large figure of a crane, while spreading its wings, encompassing the heavens.</p>
 <p>As the blood-red glow erupted from He Yao’s body, he seemed to look like a blood-red full moon. A long roar rang out, shattering the heavens as the blood-red light had seemingly pervaded the entire stretch of the world.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked towards the blood-red full moon that contained frightening power. Taking a deep breathe, black flames ignited and started to burn from within his black eyes.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s hands started to slowly spread out at this instant, and black flames started to gush out from him. A clear cry suddenly rang out from within his body as black flames surged out. In an instant, it had already pervaded throughout the horizon.</p>
 <p>Countless gazes locked tightly onto the black flames that had curled up and blotted the skies. Under the envelopment of the black flames, the temperature of the entire stretch of the world started to follow and rise.</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>Another clear cry resounded across the world, as the entire stretch of the world had seemingly flared up. Under the gazes of countless people, a pair of feathery wings clad in black flames that were able to cover up mountains suddenly unfurled out from within the surging black flames.</p>
 <p>As the black flames diffused out, countless people cast their shocked gazes towards the horizon. There, at the place where the black flames were in a lower quantity, an incomparably giant big black bird had suddenly surfaced!</p>
 <p>“That’s…!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the eyes of Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong violently contracted as they became filled with thick shades of astonishment.</p>
 <p>The Nine Netherbird!</p>
