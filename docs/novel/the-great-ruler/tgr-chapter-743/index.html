 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Havenlaw Domain, Mu Chen of the Nine Nether Palace has come forth to seek some teachings!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man stood on the air as his voice rang out, attracting countless experts of the Hundred Battles Domain to direct their gazes over. Shortly after, it had aroused a low uproar, as expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The uproar was filled with doubts and laughter because they saw that the youth before them only had a strength of Second Grade Sovereign. Even in their Hundred Battles Domain, such strength could only be considered so-so. But if he wanted to be compared to powerful Domain Lords like Qin Bei, Lin Qingfeng and the rest, he still had some ways to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there no one else in the Great Havenlaw Domain? To actually send out a brat. If they wanted to admit defeat, it would be easier to just declare it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As those mockeries rang out, the young man in the sky still had a calm expression. He didn’t seem to be enraged by those mockeries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, that fellow again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the direction of the Hundred Battles Domain, Qin Tiangang had a dark expression as he looked at Mu Chen’s figure. Standing behind him, Qin Ling had an ashened expression. His Demonic Lightning House was defeated by the hands of Mu Chen, resulting in heavy casualties. So right now, when he saw Mu Chen, his eyes naturally grew red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That brat doesn’t know how high the sky and robust the earth is. Does he think that Qin Bei is someone that anyone can challenge?” Qin Ling clenched his teeth as his speech became filled with mockery. Mu Chen had already defeated him, but that was from relying on his more refined control over Battle Will. However, the fight right now forbade the use of military, so it was too arrogant for him to stand out. Qin Ling didn’t know what the Great Havenlaw Ruler was thinking to place such an important battle on that brat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will see how miserable he will land himself in after experiencing how powerful Qin Bei is.” Qin Ling eerily looked at Mu Chen and couldn’t wait to see his miserably defeated figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they spoke out, Qin Bei, who was dressed in azure clothes, raised his head and looked at Mu Chen’s figure. There wasn’t any signs of underestimation shown on his face, since someone that could come this far, step-by-step, wasn’t a stupid fellow. Furthermore, even if Mu Chen truly was weak, he would still give it his all because it was the greatest reliance he had that made him stand out for all these years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a lion would give it his all to hunt a rabbit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qin Bei, the last battle will depend on you.” The Sword Concealing Elder said in a solemn voice as he looked at Qin Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Bei nodded his head and did not speak any further. He took a step forth and his figure flashed before Mu Chen, along with his calm voice sounding out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hundred Battles Domain, Qin Bei of the Great Compassion Sky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gradually focused his attention on the calm-looking man. Although the latter had yet to circulate his Spiritual Energy, the faint pressure that he felt made Mu Chen understand that this person before him was probably stronger than Qin Ling of the Demonic Lightning Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, Qin Ling’s strength must be in the realm of Third Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To be able to be chosen by the Great Havenlaw Ruler with your strength at Second Grade Sovereign, there must be something special about you. So I hope that you can provide some teachings.” Qin Bei looked at Mu Chen and said in an indifferent tone. Thereafter, he no longer spoke and stomped his feet. The space distorted behind him as a vast Sovereign Sea appeared with surging Spiritual Energy fluctuations sweeping between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those Spiritual Energy fluctuations had already reached the pinnacle of Third Grade Sovereign. It was so much so that Qin Bei was probably half a step into Fourth Grade Sovereign. As long as he cultivated further, he could complete his breakthrough and become a Fourth Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the direction of the Great Havenlaw Domain, everyone had ugly expressions when they felt the Spiritual Energy fluctuations emanating from Qin Bei. Xu Qing and Zhou Yue also had grave expressions. Although their strengths had reached Third Grade Sovereign, they were slightly inferior to Qin Bei. If they were the ones fighting this battle, the outcome wouldn’t be good as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them exchanged a glance and sighed. Although Qin Bei was truly the most low-profiled in the Hundred Battles Domain, his strength was the strongest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quasi-Fourth Grade Sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen also had a grave expression as he looked at Qin Bei’s silhouette. That strength was indeed the strongest so far amongst the Domain Lords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poof! Poof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dazzling light flickered on the surface of Mu Chen’s body. Shortly after, he clenched his fist and his body was swiftly enveloped in lightning as nine lightning runes appeared on his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had activated the Lightning God’s Physique to the limits with his gaze abruptly turning cold. He stomped his feet, causing the space to distort, and his figure had strangely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s figure disappeared, Qin Bei’s gaze flickered and he swiftly formed seals with a single hand, then slapped towards the space behind him. In the seal, Spiritual Energies that were as majestic as the ocean surged along with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A spatial crack abruptly appeared behind Qin Bei as a dragon image flew out and swiftly formed into Mu Chen’s figure. The powerful fist turned into lightning as it flew towards Qin Bei’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qin Bei’s seal was also flying over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fist and seal clashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A raging Spiritual Energy shock wave swept out. Mu Chen’s figure trembled, then flew out. He stabilised his figure with a heavy stomp on the air. A numbing sensation came from his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his head to look at Qin Bei. The latter had only took a few steps back. Clearly, his attack, which relied on the Dragon Soaring Art to travel through space, did not have much effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Second Grade Sovereign and yet you can travel through a short distance of space, you do have some ability after all.” Qin Bei looked at Mu Chen and said with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled but there was no reply coming from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t like to probe when I fight with others. So don’t blame me for not giving you any chance to display yourself.” Qin Bei smiled, but his smile was cold as he waved his hand, his robed fluttering amongst the wind. As it abruptly fluttered, explosions were sent out as the majestic ocean of Spiritual Energy swept out in every direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His figure moved and directly appeared high in the sky. He stretched his hand out and gently pressed down towards the space where Mu Chen stood. After he pressed down, there were light runes flickering on his palm that formed into what like a stone tablet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dazzling Spiritual Energy abruptly spread out and along with Qin Bei pressing his hand down, it formed into a huge palm. At the heart of the palm, there was a stone tablet talisman that was abruptly bursting with light. That palm looked like it could suppress mountains and rivers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Divine Tablet Hand!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;As Qin Bei barked out, the shadow of the Spiritual Energy palm had already enveloped Mu Chen, with no path of retreat for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen deeply inhaled a mouthful of air as a cold light surged within his black pupils. In the next instant, a torrential ominous aura soared into the horizon as a massive demonic pillar appeared with a flash. Mu Chen hugged his arms together and lifted it up, smashing it against the Spiritual Energy palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifying Spiritual Energy windstorm endlessly swept out. Under the suppression of the huge palm of Spiritual Energy, Mu Chen and the Great Meru Demonic Pillar were slowly moving down towards the ground. In this frontal confrontation, Qin Bei, whose Spiritual Energy was thicker, had the advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure fell onto a mountain peak, causing the mountain to shatter. The Great Meru Demonic Pillar was holding the palm up as Mu Chen’s body was violently flickering with lightning. A deep roar came from his throat as ancient demonic runes wriggled on the Great Meru Demonic Pillar. The ominous aura that made others feel fearful had also completely burst out right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scarlet ominous light pillar, along with the Great Meru Demonic Pillar, had directly pierced through the hand, shattering it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shattering the hand, Mu Chen’s expression wasn’t relaxed but turned even more grave. In the sky, there were massive stone tablet palm prints constantly descending. Even the mountains showed signs of crumbling from the powerful Spiritual Energy pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qin Bei had said, he did not hold himself back in this attack. Facing such frantic attacks, it could kill any Third Grade Sovereign expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts in the direction of the Great Havenlaw Domain felt fearful of Qin Bei’s attacks. Even Xu Qing and Zhou Yue’s faces were unsightly, since they knew that they would have been defeated from this series of attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not know how Mu Chen would fair under such attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their gazes were directed at the crumbled mountain peak. The youth held onto the Great Meru Demonic Pillar on a huge rock. Although his handsome face was grave, it was still calm without fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing and the experts of the Nine Nether Palace had their fists tightly clenched together, their eyes filled with worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the direction of the Hundred Battles Domain, countless experts gradually had their minds easing up. From their judgement, there had already been an outcome to this last battle. Under the attacks of Qin Bei, that brat named Mu Chen seemed to be constantly at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the stone tablet palm prints whistled over and reflected in Mu Chen’s eyes, they were like collapsing mountains and roaring oceans. However, there wasn’t any fear in his eyes. He then slowly closed his eyes and formed seals with both of his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dazzling golden light seemed to have swept out under the descending palm prints as the light instantly enveloped this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Explosions resounded, causing the earth to violently tremble. The mountain range crumbled in patches as huge cracks endlessly stretched towards the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cloud of dust spreads out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire region was silent as many experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain wore nervous expressions, while there were people that couldn’t help laughing out in the direction of the Hundred Battles Domain…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, their laughter only lasted for an instant as a dazzling golden light shot out from the rising dust. Even Qin Bei, who had a calm expression while in the air, couldn’t help having some changes in his expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He waved his hand, sweeping a strong wind that blew the dust away. When the dust was blown away, he abruptly narrowed his eyes when he saw a massive figure a thousand feet tall standing on the crumbled ruins of the mountain range with a golden blazing sun behind its head. At the same time, an indescribable pressure enveloped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the head of the thousand-foot golden figure, Mu Chen quietly stood there, without any injuries. He raised his head, and looked at Qin Bei. As the two of them looked at each other, chill flowed and sparks flew, even the space between their gazes had distorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of confrontation was a genuine battle between a tiger and dragon!</span></p>
