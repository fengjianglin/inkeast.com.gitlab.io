 <p><strong>Chapter 367 - Short Exchange</strong></p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Boundless Spiritual Energy swept out as three figures appeared on top of the mountain peak. As the astonishing Spiritual Energy fluctuations rippled out, they converged to form enormous waves of pressure. Akin to black clouds looming over in the sky, they pressed down on Mu Gui and and his group in the distance.</p>
 <p>“That’s Mu Chen! Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong too!”</p>
 <p>Surprise and elation instantly erupted on the faces of Su Xuan and the rest as they noticed the three figures that appeared. Originally, they had assumed that Mu Chen would appear by himself. However, they never imagined that he had actually found Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong.</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng? Li Xuantong? They’ve recovered their strength?!”</p>
 <p>On the other side, upon noticing Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, who were erupting within astonishingly imposing auras, while appearing even stronger than before, the faces of Mu Gui, Gui Xiong and the rest could not help changing.</p>
 <p><em>Weren’t those two fellows poisoned by the Demonic Dragon Poison? How could they have recovered their strength? That poison required a Sovereign Stage expert to dispel it! Could it be that they had a Sovereign Stage expert to secretly helping them?</em></p>
 <p>As their emotions fluctuated, all of them became vigilant and on guard. If the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy truly sent a Sovereign Stage expert, they were simply unable to even run away.</p>
 <p>“Although the Demonic Dragon Poison requires a Sovereign Stage expert to dispel it. If one has some special methods, one could similarly dispel that poison. If the Sovereign Stage experts of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy dared to take action, the Sovereigns of our Demonic Dragon Palace would have naturally noticed it.” Mo Longzi spoke out in an indifferent tone, causing the shock within the hearts of their group to stabilize and calm down.</p>
 <p>His apathetic eyes turned towards Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong and Mu Chen. Filled with a sinister shadow, he spoke towards them, “However, you guys being able to dispel the Demonic Dragon Poison truly exceeded my expectations.”</p>
 <p>Sending a similarly sinister gaze that locked onto Mo Longzi, Shen Cangsheng replied with a sneer, “I’m afraid that there’re a lot things that exceeds your expectations.”</p>
 <p>As a chilling intent erupted from his eyes, Shen Cangsheng took a step forward, causing the Spiritual Energy erupting from him to drastically rise. The degree of Spiritual Energy was much more tyrannical than a normal Heavenly Completion Stage Middle Phase, it had already come endlessly close to a Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase.</p>
 <p>He was about to make a breakthrough!</p>
 <p>Feeling the Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiating out of him, the faces of Mu Gui and their group slightly changed. Truly worthy of being Shen Cangsheng. After suffering such a huge blow, not only did he not feel depressed, he was even able to improve his strength. If they were to allow him to rush back from here, he might truly be able to make a breakthrough to Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase.</p>
 <p>Staring at Shen Cangsheng, Mo Longzi’s eyes had also narrowed. This Shen Cangsheng truly was very formidable. Him being able to promote to Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase was completely due to the cultivation method of their Demonic Dragon Palace, coupled with him obtaining a vast amount of resources. However, this was considered a kind of overdraft, as cultivating like that had lead to a drop in his life span. Therefore, he could be considered to have paid an extremely great price. However, before his eyes, time after time, this Shen Cangsheng was still able to catch up to him, leading to some frustration and fury to rise within his heart.</p>
 <p>“Although you’re about to break through, you’ve still not reached Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase. Just like that, you still dare to fight with me?!” roared Mo Longzi in a dark voice.</p>
 <p>“Whether or not I’ll win will be known when we fight!”</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng replied in a joyful manner, no fear present in his voice, and disdain showing in his eyes. He was the Overlord of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Heavenly Rankings, and represented the prestige of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy! Therefore, regardless of the opponent he was faced against, he would absolutely not cower or retreat!</p>
 <p>He knew that the Mo Longzi before him was a formidable foe. However, that was not a reason for him to feel fear and dread.</p>
 <p>As dark glint flashed within Mo Longzi’s eyes, he gave a wave of his sleeve. In the next instant, Lin Zheng and the other two, who had fainted due to their serious injuries, started to float up from the mountain peak into the air.</p>
 <p>Seeing this happen, the faces of Mu Chen, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong all sunk. Lin Zheng and the other two had already landed in the hands of their enemies?</p>
 <p>“Haha. Although the two of you were rescued, they have landed in my hands,” said Mo Longzi with a ruminating smile. “Do you think this exchange is worth it?”</p>
 <p>“I also have two of your people in my hands.” replied Mu Chen with a sneer. With a bend of his palm, a suction force erupted out before two figures came shooting over from a place not far away. Those two figures were Chi Yu and Mao Jiang.</p>
 <p>Shooting an indifferent glare at the two, Mo Longzi gave a faint smile and said, “They’re just wastes, nothing of any importance. Do whatever you want with them.”</p>
 <p>His words and tone appeared exceedingly emotionless, not showing the slightest bit of care towards his previous companions. Perhaps, he didn’t treat Chi Yu and Mao Jiang as his companions in the first place.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Worthy of Mo Longzi. Looks like they were just tools being used by you, just like those people behind you, right?” replied Mu Chen with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>Instantly, Mu Gui, Gui Xiong and the rest started to slightly wrinkle their foreheads. They had also discovered the provocation within Mu Chen’s words. However, it was hard to avoid feeling a little uncomfortable within their hearts.</p>
 <p>“You sharp-tongued brat!”</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi looked with a slightly chilling glare towards Mu Chen, before replying with dark voice, “You’re that fellow that had killed Bai Xuan and was almost killed by me? Never though that you’re actually able to reach such a stage in less than a year. If I’d known earlier, I would have killed you then and there.”</p>
 <p>He had already guessed that the Demonic Dragon Poison within Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had more or less been dealt with by Mu Chen. If not, Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong wouldn’t have taken that long if they were to had any ways to deal with the poison.</p>
 <p>“It’s a pity that you won’t get a second chance,” replied Mu Chen with a smile.</p>
 <p>“As if a Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase has the qualifications to say such stuff in front of me. Why do I need something like a chance? With your strength, I can kill all I want!” A sinister shadow flashed within Mo Longzi’s eyes as he took a step forward. In an instant, only a remnant shadow remained at his original position as he appeared right behind Mu Chen. Sending a palm patting forward, greyish-black Spiritual Energy swept out, transforming into a roaring demonic dragon as it rumbled towards Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>However, just as that roaring demonic dragon rumbled out, a long spear sparkling with golden light created a golden streak of light as it swept out. Shattering the air apart, it pierced right towards that demonic dragon.</p>
 <p>“I really want to see how you plan to kill other people in front of me!” Spiritual Energy erupted out from Shen Cangsheng’s body without the slightest bit of restraint, while a chilling intent gushed out from his eyes. With a shudder of his golden long spear, spear shadows that blotted the sky, hiding the skies and covered the earth as they enveloped Mo Longzi’s body, aiming towards his vitals.</p>
 <p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>
 <p>Flicking his ten fingers, greyish-black streaks of light explosively shot out from Mo Longzi, shattering all of the spear shadows that had come over to engulf him, while his body fluttered and retreated.</p>
 <p>“Mo Longzi, do you dare to fight a duel with me?!”</p>
 <p>Fighting intent erupted from Shen Cangsheng’s eyes as his figure explosively rushed forward. During this period of time, he had pursued Mo Longzi in an attempt to kill him. However, the latter had kept on avoiding and running away since the beginning, causing his guard to gradually slip away. At the end, the latter had used the means of an encirclement to cause injury to him and Li Xuantong. Between the two of them, they never had a true duel from the beginning till now. This was something that Shen Cangsheng was extremely unresigned about; he thirsted for a true fight with the latter.</p>
 <p>In an extremely fast speed, he chased after to Mo Longzi in a flash. Golden light erupted from his eyes as he hoisted his golden spear up, while bright and resplendent rays of brilliance, akin to that of gold, shot out from the body of his spear.</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>The golden long spear shook, seemingly erupting with astonishing humming noises. Fighting intent erupted from it as boundless Spiritual Energy transformed into a golden lotus at the front of the golden long spear. On the surface of the golden lotus, extremely swift and fierce spear shadows swept from it.</p>
 <p>“War God’s Golden Lotus!”</p>
 <p>As fighting intent erupted from Shen Cangsheng’s eyes, his spear pierced straight out. In the next instant, the golden lotus at the tip of his spear crazily revolved. Like a golden scorching sun, it caused golden light to illuminate everywhere, piercing through the dense spiritual mist in the surroundings.</p>
 <p>That spear from Shen Cangsheng was akin to the horns hanging from a deer, akin to being made by the heavens. The formidable might of it caused even space to start distorting, showing its extreme power.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this spectacle, the faces of Mu Gui and his group in the distance slightly changed. If it was one of them, they might simply not be able to receive such a spear. This Shen Cangsheng was truly worthy of of being the most outstanding Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy student within his batch.</p>
 <p>Looking at the golden light that had erupted out, a chilling glint surfaced within Mo Longzi’s eyes. With a cold snort, he clasped his palms together, before abruptly separating them. At this instant, a black dragon mark seemed to have surfaced within one of his palms.</p>
 <p>“Demonic Dragon Heaven Shattering Palm!”</p>
 <p>He sent his palm patting out, causing churning Spiritual Energy to gush out. In the next instant, a gigantic demonic dragon a hundred feet long roared as it exited. Carrying along dragon roars that shook the sky, it brought along astonishing might as it smashed head-on against the golden lotus.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As the two powerful attacks collided, everyone heard an enormous sound ring out. Boundless rays of brilliance swept out, with the golden and black light filling their halves in the horizon.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Devastating Spiritual Energy storms swept out, forcing the two figures in the sky to retreat upon making contact, shooting back from where they started.</p>
 <p>Heavily hammering his golden spear down, Shen Cangsheng forcefully stabilised himself, before looking gravely at the distance. The one present there was Mo Longzi, whom had fluttered and landed, his hands behind his back as he stood upright.</p>
 <p>Such a tyrannical spear from him was still unable to deal with Mo Longzi. The latter’s strength at the Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase truly was very strong.</p>
 <p>“Prepare to move.”</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng spoke out in a deep voice. As of now, although they had lost Lin Zheng and the other two Great Generals, their lineup wasn’t considered weaker than their opponents. As long as they could entangle Mo Longzi, with Mu Chen’s, Li Xuantong’s and Luo Li’s strength, they were capable of defeating their enemies.</p>
 <p>However, just as they were prepared to revolve their Spiritual Energy and take action, Mo Longzi gave a soft laugh. With a wave of his sleeve, Lin Zheng and the other two landed in front of Mu Gui and his group, before being grabbed by them.</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng, since you want to truly fight with me that much, I’ll give you a chance. However…”</p>
 <p>Mo Longzi’s tone changed, before continuing with a smile. “It’ll not be in this place. I’ll wait for you all at the Western Desolated City outside of the Western Desolated Territory. If you want to save them, come to the Western Desolated City!”</p>
 <p>“Haha, I want to kill all the so-called prideful sons of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy in front of the countless people present there! At that time, the name of me, Mo Longzi, will resound across the Northern Heavens Continent!”</p>
 <p>“I’ll let everyone know that the students taught by your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy will always be inferior to our Demonic Dragon Palace!”</p>
 <p>With a hearty chuckle, Mo Longzi fluttered as he retreated, with his group of vicious people rapidly following suit.</p>
 <p>“If you want to save these three people, I’ll wait for you at the Western Desolated City. Noon, Tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>“Where do you think you’re going?!”</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng gave a cold roar. With a move of his body, he explosively rushed forward to give pursuit.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, the person at the rear, Wu Jia gave a faint smile. Clapping his hands together, spiritual mist instantly swept forth from the surrounding area, completely covering the basin up. As this happened, their figures rapidly disappeared within the spiritual mist.</p>
 <p>As their figures disappeared, the only thing remaining of them was Mo Longzi’s sinister laughter, resounding back at Shen Cangsheng and the group.</p>
 <p>“Shen Cangsheng, if you don’t want to see the bodies of those three being hung on the Western Desolated City, be prepared to keep our appointment!”</p>
