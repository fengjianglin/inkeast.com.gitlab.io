Although his figure was a little miserable from the battle, his gaze, which was still sharp and radiant, made many experts throb. After witnessing that shocking battle, no one had anymore contempt for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire region was silent as many dazed gazes were looking at that figure, having not recovered from the earlier battle…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silence lasted for a long while, before many gazes started to turn heated. Shortly after, in the camp of the Great Havenlaw Domain, there was a mountain-crumbling and ocean-roaring cheers that resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who could have expected that the last battle, which was supposed to be the most unremarkable, would decide the battle between the two factions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Qing and Zhou Yue exchanged a look and sighed in the end. A smear of admiration flashed in their eyes. If defeating Wu Tian had caused them to pay more attention to Mu Chen, then this time had caused the prideful two to completely accept him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because they knew that if it was them fighting, they would have long lost in the hands of Qin Bei, not to mention bearing the huge pressure and turning the battle around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away, Wu Tian’s face was switching between white and green in the party of the Blood Hawk Hall, feeling resentful. Because he knew that from today on, the distance between him and Mu Chen would only get bigger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the Great Havenlaw Domain faction, the Nine Nether Palace had the loudest cheers. At this point of time, even Tang Bing, who usually had a cold temperament, had her face turned red. Her eyes were glittering as she looked at the far away figure. Ever since the establishment of the Nine Nether Palace, this was the first time that their Nine Nether Palace had enjoyed such glory in the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, the Domain Ruler’s eyes are keen indeed.” The Sky Vulture Emperor smiled with his eyes narrowed at this sight. Mu Chen was someone that Nine Nether had back, so the Sky Vulture Emperor also had expectations for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truly not bad.” Even the Sleeping Emperor, who rarely spoke, commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light that enveloped the Great Havenlaw Ruler fluctuated as a laughter rang out, “The potential of this kid is pretty good. Nine Nether has brought a true genius to our Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was oblivious that he was very satisfied with Mu Chen’s performance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Great Havenlaw Domain’s faction was covered with earth-shaking cheers, the Hundred Battles Domain was listless and quiet. Many experts had ashen expressions, since they never expected that a battle of absolute victory would end up with a loss…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Concealing Elder, Corpse Mountain Demon and the Devil Compassion Sovereign had unsightly expressions. They had already calculated this battle and they had a decent chance of success, thus proposing it. The first two battles went as they had expected, only the third battle went beyond their control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, Qin Bei should’ve been able to sweep through all the Domain Lords of the Great Havenlaw Domain with his strength. Not even Xu Qing and Zhou Yue could fight with him. But who could have known that a new Commander, Mu Chen, came out that had hidden his cards well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fight concerned 1,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids and 1000 cities. Even a powerful force like the Hundred Battles Domain would feel a heartache to give out those things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Concealing Elder and everyone else were looking at Mu Chen with ill gazes, wishing that they could tear him apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The three battles have come to an end, my Great Havenlaw Domain obtained two wins and a loss. Prepare the 1,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids and 1000 cities as soon as possible, I will ask for it personally.” Great Havenlaw Ruler’s indifferent voice rang out, causing all the experts of the Hundred Battles Domain faction’s heart to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Concealing Elder and Corpse Mountain Demon gritted their teeth as they looked at Liu Tiandao. The latter had a dark expression at the moment, his gaze flashed but he did not look at them. It was directed at Mu Chen, who was in the sky far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing his gaze, Mu Chen felt a chilling sensation on his skin as he raised the alert in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao finally spoke as he faintly laughed, “Since you guys have lost, then you must honour the agreement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Concealing Elder and the rest could only nod their heads with aches in their hearts upon hearing him. With the character of the Great Havenlaw Ruler, if they were to not acknowledge this debt, the Hundred Battles Domain might pay an even heavier price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master Liu truly keeps his promises.” Great Havenlaw Ruler lightly laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao laughed, but he did not continue on the conversation with Great Havenlaw Ruler. His sharp gaze that looked like it could penetrate through others was directed at Mu Chen as he slowly said, “But I have something I need to enquire from Commander Mu Chen of the Great Havenlaw Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen’s heart trembled as a chill surged forth. Could it be that he knew about Liu Ming’s matter since he was making things difficult for him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, Nine Nether’s face slightly changed with her gaze flickering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder what Sect Master Liu wants to ask of me?” Although he was nervous, Mu Chen still maintained a calm expression on his face as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Half a year ago, my son has gone to the Merchant Continent and purchased a Divine Art named Nine Dragons and Elephants Art for a great price in an auction. However, he had gone missing on the return journey. It was so much so that even two Elders, one protecting him in the light and the other in the dark, went missing as well.” Liu Tiandao’s faint voice resounded in the sky, causing the temperature in this region to slowly decrease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Concealing Elder and the rest were also looking at Liu Tiandao in astonishment. They seemed to have sensed something wrong from the latter and immediately directed their flickering gazes towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they didn’t know what the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art was, the powerful Divine Art that Mu Chen had displayed in the end looked somewhat like it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have investigated after that and realised that the two Elders and my son were suppressed beneath the ground with the one responsible for it having at least reached the Earth Sovereign Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao said without any expression on his face, “And now, the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art has appeared from you. Can you explain that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen's heart slightly trembled. Liu Tiandao was indeed formidable to be able to find out where Liu Ming was being suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art is rare, it is not unique. Since I can obtain it, it’s naturally due to opportunities opened to me… Could it be that Sect Master Liu thinks that I have invited an Earth Sovereign expert to act? I don’t have that capability.” said Mu Chen. At this point in time, he naturally couldn’t admit to it. Otherwise, Liu Tiandao’s rage wouldn’t be something that he could bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s gaze held no emotion as he looked at Mu Chen. Shortly after, he revealed an eerie smile and waved his hand. The space was torn apart behind him, forming into a space passage. Shortly after, spiritual light shot out from the passage, forming into two figures standing behind Liu Tiandao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Directing his gaze over, Mu Chen’s face instantly turned unsightly upon seeing a figure. Because it was Liu Ming whom Lin Jing’s mother had personally suppressed under the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That fellow was actually rescued!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing beside Liu Ming was a white-clothed man with his hands held behind his back. He had a similar appearance to Liu Ming, but his bearing wasn’t something that the former could be compared to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ming’er, can you see if you know this person?” Liu Tiandao faintly said.</span></p>

An endless viciousness poured from his eyes and he eerily smiled. “Haha, you have given me a hard time looking for you, kid!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen's heart sank to the bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The experts of both factions instantly understood what was going on. It seems that Mu Chen had once acted against Liu Ming and even sealed him. However, he did not do a clean job and now, he was recognized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the direction of the Hundred Battles Domain, everyone rejoiced at Mu Chen’s misfortune. Whereas many experts of the Great Havenlaw Domain had grave expressions. If this matter wasn’t handled well, then they would completely fall out with the Sky Profound Palace. The outcome would far exceed having a war with the Hundred Battles Domain. After all, the two parties were true peak forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Earth Sovereign expert that you have invited does have some means. I could not break the seal alone and had to fork out a huge sum to invite a big shot to rescue my son. But after rescuing him, the meridians in his body are more or less damaged. His Spiritual Energy has dispersed. Although I can restore him with the help of a few Spiritual Elixirs, this will be his limit for his entire lifetime.” Liu Tiandao faintly smiled, except that his laughter was filled with killing intent that could not be concealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are the one that cripple Liu Ming’s Spiritual Energy?” The white-clothed man standing before Liu Ming slightly frowned his brows as he stared at Mu Chen. Thereafter, he said with indifference, “Since that’s the case, then you can be crippled as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the white-clothed man’s figure abruptly trembled, then appeared before Mu Chen. He held a jade fan in his hand and swiftly pointed it at the center of Mu Chen’s brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the white-clothed man attacked, he had revealed extremely stunning strength. As Mu Chen had experienced a great battle, the Spiritual Energy in his body had already been exhausted. Thus, faced with the attack from the white-clothed man, he could not avoid it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen wasn’t someone that would sit and wait for death to arrive and was about to circulate what was left of his Spiritual Energy. Suddenly, a figure had abruptly appeared before him, stretching her slim finger and clashed with the jade fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

The gorgeous figure only lightly trembled, while the white-clothed man had taken tens of steps back. The jade fan in his hand was opened with scarlet flames burning the fan, while his cold gaze was directed at the figure before Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Ming did mention before that there was a woman with considerable strength together with Mu Chen. I believe it must be you.” The white-clothed man stared at Nine Nether, who stood before Mu Chen, as he slowly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether stood before Mu Chen with a cold expression. However, Mu Chen still noticed that her hand had involuntarily clenched. Clearly, the sudden burst of this matter had gone out of her expectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao waved his hand, obstructing the man in white as he looked at Mu Chen and Nine Nether with indifference. Thereafter, he directed his gaze towards the Great Havenlaw Ruler, who was seated on the throne and had not spoken a word. “These two people have crippled my son, this is an extremely important enmity between us. I hope that the Great Havenlaw Ruler can hand the two of them over to us. As compensation, my Sky Profound Palace is willing to pay 2,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids. In addition… I can promise you here that my Sky Profound Palace will not take any actions towards the Great Havenlaw Domain in the Hunting War.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Liu Tiandao spoke, not only did many people in the Hundred Battles Domain become shocked, there were also many experts from the Great Havenlaw Domain that felt a jolt in their hearts. Because the conditions that Liu Tiandao had given was too tempting. Not to mention the 2,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquids, just that promise to not act towards the Great Havenlaw Domain was enough to move the hearts of the upper hierarchy. Everyone knew that the Hunting War concerned the survival of peak forces like them. If they were to provoke a formidable enemy like the Sky Profound Palace, no one would be able to feel at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Probably not even the Great Havenlaw Ruler would refuse such conditions. The crucial point was that they only had to hand over Mu Chen and Nine Nether as the price for it. In the eyes of many, it was a choice that did not require one to think!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s face had slightly changed as well, she never thought that Liu Tiandao would have so much hatred towards them that he was actually willing to pay such a price. Nine Nether had always been an intelligent person, so she was also clear that such temptations was fatal to any forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her somewhat cold hand lightly held onto Mu Chen’s and she used a voice that the two of them could only hear, “If anything happens, escape with all we can!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s face was a little dark, Nine Nether had clearly thought of the worse case scenario. Before interest, even the deep and unfathomable Great Havenlaw Ruler might choose to forsake them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he had just done a great service for the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>

There was no longer someone like Dean Tai Cang to tell him that no matter what, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy would forever be his backing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the entire region, the tensed atmosphere was suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao’s gaze was staring at Great Havenlaw Ruler. He did not place Mu Chen and Nine Nether in his eyes, since he was very confident that as long as the Great Havenlaw Ruler was wise, he would not refuse such conditions. A small Nine Nether King and an even smaller Commander was not worth a mention for those at their level!</span></p>
