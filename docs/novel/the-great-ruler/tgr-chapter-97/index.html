 <p><strong>Chapter 97 - Spiritual Rotation Stage Late Phase</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surging Spiritual Energy rushed out like a flood and roared past Mu Chen’s limbs. Due to the abundance of Spiritual Energy, Mu Chen felt a pricking pain in his meridians. It was evident that his meridians had reached the limits of enduring it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Mu Chen was clear about the condition of his body. He immediately circulated the Great Pagoda Art in order to drive the dense Spiritual Energy through the Spiritual Art’s circulation route.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Waves of Spiritual Energy were ingested by the Great Pagoda Art and were turned into numerous dark black Spiritual Energy before it fused into the Spiritual Energy Wheel within his aurasea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying this influx of dense Spiritual Energy, the originally pigeon egg-sized Spiritual Energy Wheel slowly grew. The Spiritual Energy lights flashing on the surface also became brighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire aurasea seemed to have rumbled at this moment. This commotion awakened the Nine Netherbird, who was trapped inside the dark purple mandala flower within his aurasea. It watched this scene with a cold and cruel gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, it suddenly stood up when it witnessed the scene. The burning black flames within his black wings suddenly enshrouded the cage which trapped it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, against the impact, the light barrier cage formed by the mandala flower rippled. It did not show even the slightest signs of shattering. A hint of hatred flashed through the Nine Netherbird’s eyes. Right now, it was an excellent chance for it to attack Mu Chen. But this abominable cage had sealed it to the extent that it couldn’t even display any means of attacks towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regarding the Nine Netherbird’s actions, Mu Chen did not have the time to care about it. He was completely focused on controlling the surging Spiritual Energy within his body. At this moment, he could not afford even the slightest error.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spiritual Energy within his meridians howled endlessly. This high-speed circulation made Mu Chen’s meridians ache. This time, there was way too much Spiritual Energy entering his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was clearly useless to be thinking about this right now. Therefore, Mu Chen could only concentrate and he circulated the Great Pagoda Art to the extreme. He ingested the violent Spiritual Energy constantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time quickly passed by and in the blink of an eye, two hours had passed. During this period of time, the Spiritual Energy Wheel within Mu Chen’s aurasea had expanded by an entire size. Right now, he had already reached the Spiritual Rotation Stage Middle Phase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was still a considerable amount of Spiritual Energy surging endlessly within his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was time to charge at the Spiritual Rotation Stage Late Phase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This idea flashed through Mu Chen’s mind. He immediately took a deep breath. The surging Spiritual Energy within his meridians accelerated as it flowed through the Great Pagoda Art’s circulation route.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This speed made his meridians contract slightly. However, Mu Chen ignored it. The domineering Great Pagoda Art would be enough to control the violent Spiritual Energy. The violent Spiritual Energy that others might not be able to deal with was like a tamed sheep inside his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you should just become part of my Spiritual Energy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen muttered within his heart. Above the Spiritual Energy Wheel, lights condensed and turned into an illusory light tower. This light tower swayed and absorbed the flooding Spiritual Energy like a whale. Then, with the empowerment of the massive amount of Spiritual Energy, the illusory light tower seemed to have turned slightly material.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The absorption speed of the light tower was extremely terrifying. In a matter of just a dozen minutes, the dense Spiritual Energy within Mu Chen’s meridians was completly absorbed by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the illusory light tower seemed to have become more corporeal after absorbing this dense Spiritual Energy. This made Mu Chen exclaim loudly. If he wanted to turn the illusory light tower into a corporeal light tower, wouldn’t the amount of Spiritual Energy he required be terrifying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen smacked his lips in shock. He immediately concentrated and the light tower slowly faded away into lights as it entered the Spiritual Energy Wheel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the lights entered his Spiritual Energy Wheel, the light wheel shook violently. Waves of dense Spiritual Energy fluctuations emitted out constantly and the size of the Spiritual Energy Wheel expanded at a visible speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a matter of seconds, the Spiritual Energy Wheel had expanded to the point where it was the size of an infant’s fist. Around the light wheel, Spiritual Energy lights would emerge. It looked rather abstruse as if it was enveloping the stars outside of the galaxy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dense Spiritual Energy fluctuation emitted out from within Mu Chen’s body. This sense of power made his pores open up. It was an indescribable and comforting feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen sensed the Spiritual Energy Wheel with a bit of joy. With its degree of strength, he had truly reached the Spiritual Rotation Stage Late Phase!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After suppressing his Spiritual Energy during this period of time, he had finally reached this level with the help of the Nine Truths Blood Ginseng and the Great Pagoda Art. As long as he advanced one more step, he would become a Spirit Stage powerhouse!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That level would be a qualitative change to his cultivation. In the Northern Spiritual Realm, a person at the Spiritual Rotation Stage Late Phase was quite powerful. However, to tell the truth, there are many of them. If they wanted to truly become a leader of a force, they could only do it if they possessed the strength of a Spirit Stage powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because everybody knew that the capability of a Spirit Stage powerhouse was simply not something that a Spiritual Rotation Stage Late Phase could compare with. No matter how many Spiritual Rotation Stage Late Phase men you had, it was not as convincing as you, yourself, being a Spirit Stage powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were two completely different levels. The prestige that they represent was also completely different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen nodded in satisfaction when he felt the density of the Spiritual Energy within his body. Then, he focused his consciousness on the Nine Netherbird which was trapped within the aurasea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was completely focused on ingesting the Spiritual Energy previously, he did not ignore the actions that the Nine Netherbird did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird also noticed Mu Chen. However, it only glanced at him coldly before lying down lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn feathery bird, you’ve already lost your influence and position right now. Can’t you act sincerely?” Mu Chen said with a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Mu Chen call it a damn feathery bird, the Nine Netherbird bursted into a rage. The blazing wings fiercely flapped and a cold intent was conveyed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wouldn’t benefit if you were to kill me. Therefore, you should act more sincerely!” Mu Chen said heartlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With your Spiritual Rotation Stage Late Phase strength, you are worse than an ant in my eyes. You dare scold me?” Thoughts surged out from the Nine Netherbird. Within it, a cold murderous intent was conveyed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think that it’s your victory because you’ve trapped me within your body? This mandala flower isn’t something that you can control!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Mu Chen flew into a rage. His consciousness moved and actually floated towards the cage formed by the mandala flower. Then, his consciousness slowly touched it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it was touched, Mu Chen was exceptionally nervous. It was true that he didn’t have a way of controlling the mysterious mandala flower which had &nbsp;emerged from the black paper. But no matter what, this was the only thing that was capable of restraining the Nine Netherbird. He must attempt it. Otherwise, the Nine Netherbird would never listen to his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Chen timidly touched the mandala flower, he was stunned. The rebound that he expected to come did not appear and, instead, his consciousness also integrated into the mandala flower a little bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Mu Chen felt that he could control the mandala flower a little bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This feeling instantly made Mu Chen froze. Shortly after, a surge of ecstasy filled his mind. Afterwards, he stared unfavorably at the Nine Netherbird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird also detected something. It folded its black wings uneasily and was on alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn feathery bird. I’ll make it so that you’ll want to hurt me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen snickered and moved his consciousness. The massive flower petals of the mandala flower actually spread out slowly and whacked fiercely at the Nine Netherbird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird, who was caught off-guard, immediately issued a cry of pain when it was hit by the flower petals. The black flames on its body dimmed slightly. Then, a hint of fear finally emerged within its eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was evident that it never expected that Mu Chen would be capable of activating this mysterious mandala flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Mu Chen’s heart was filled with delight. During this time, he had to endure the Nine Netherbird’s attitude and could not do anything to get back at it. Now, he finally had a mean to counter back. He immediately activated the mandala flower in order to smack at the Nine Netherbird endlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird evaded it awkwardly. Every time it was hit by the mandala flower’s petals, the black flames on its body would dim. This made it a bit frightened. The mandala flower was quite mysterious as it was actually capable of absorbing its energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mu Chen, don’t go overboard now. Believe it or not, I’ll fight to the bitter end with you!” After avoiding repeatedly, the Nine Netherbird also entered a rampage and the feathers on its body stood up. Within the thought that was conveyed over, it was full of rage and horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, this is a punishment that you deserve. Since you’re staying in my body, you should act more honestly. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not holding back if you hold some ill desire towards me.” Mu Chen said ruthlessly. He did not dare to push the Nine Netherbird too hard. After all, the latter was not an ordinary existence. Even though it was weakened a lot, who knew if it had some sort of last resort or not? If he made the Nine Netherbird feel anxious and it decided to fight him to the death, Mu Chen might not be able to endure it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fury filled the Nine Netherbird’s eyes. However, it stopped scorning and ridiculing Mu Chen. Instead, it shook the feathers on its body and slowly lay down. Now that Mu Chen was capable of controlling the mandala flower, it was best not to provoke this person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that the Nine Netherbird finally caved in, Mu Chen let out a sigh of relief. Then, his consciousness exited the mandala flower. But once he exited it, he felt a sense of dizziness. A feeling of fatigue emitted out and made him drowsy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So controlling the mandala flower actually consumes this much mental energy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen was shocked and forcibly suppressed the stress that he felt. The mandala flower was indeed strange. He had activated it inaccurately, yet it nearly made him fell asleep. Then, wouldn’t he faint if he attempted to use it to do something?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems that I shouldn’t use it often.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen muttered to himself. Then, his consciousness exited his body. Although the consumption was great, he still obtained a measure that the Nine Netherbird was afraid of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This damn feathery bird. Just wait until I advance to the Spirit Stage, I’ll deal with you then!”</span></p>
