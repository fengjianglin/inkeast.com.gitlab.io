 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five crystals floated before the two of them with faint and mysterious lustres being emitted from them. Those emitted lustres weren’t strong, but were enough to make one dazzled and stunned. That’s because they were clear about the price of the things held in those crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the peak forces in the Northern Region would scramble for those items. Although it wasn’t easy to forge a Battle Formation Master, these things at least provided them with the opportunity to nurture a Battle Formation Master. If they really managed to nurture one, then they would greatly profit from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s eyes stared at the five crystals as he licked his lips. He and Zhantai Liuli exchanged a glance. They could see the unconcealable excitement in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Approach them with your will.” The Sky Formation Emperor smiled as he continued, “You cannot force yourself to cultivate in Will Techniques. If you aren’t compatible with it, then you won’t be able to succeed even if you possess it. If you force your way through, you will cause yourself to suffer injuries instead. So if you’re not fated with it, then leave it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Zhantai Liuli’s hearts clenched as they pondered about how harsh it was to become a Battle Formation Master. Not to mention the risk of the Will Techniques, they even had to be compatible with it…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the two of them clearly did not have any authority to speak and could only inhale a mouthful of air and gradually shut their eyes. Their hearts were calm and shapeless wills gushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His vision had turned dark and with the movement of his will, Mu Chen felt the five lumps of light appearing before him. Those five lumps of light each had a different colour, but every single one of them was emitting a mysterious lustre. Amongst the five lumps of light, the one in the middle was the most dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, that crystal should be the Will Technique left by the Sky Formation Emperor, which was the most completed one. On the contrary, the four remaining ones were somewhat darker, inferior to the middle one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen wasn’t surprised by that. After all, according to the Sky Formation Emperor, the Will Techniques in the four other crystals were collected by him and not something that belonged to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s will stopped outside the five crystals for a long while, before moving towards the middle crystal. Since there was a completed version of the Will Techniques, it’s impossible for him to give up on it. No matter what, he had to give it a try. In the event that he’s compatible with it, then he could return from this trip with a full harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s will swept over and swiftly approached that crystal, before coiling around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when Mu Chen’s will coiled around it, there wasn’t any movement from the crystal. Although the lustre emitting from it was a little brighter, it was still far from being compatible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s attempt for the completed technique left by the Sky Formation Emperor had immediately failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if a bucket of water was dropped down on his head, making his heart turn cold. Although he had never felt confident, he still suffered a setback when he wasn’t compatible with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But a setback was merely a setback, Mu Chen wasn’t someone to give up. Immediately, he bitterly smiled and retracted his will. Since he wasn’t compatible with the Will Technique left by the Sky Formation Emperor, then he could only make an attempt with the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen’s will retreated, he could sense another will approach. It clearly belonged to Zhantai Liuli, since she had also felt the importance in that crystal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s will was sensing Zhantai Liuli’s will coiling around that cold crystal ball…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz! Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when Zhantai Liuli’s will coiled around that crystal ball, Mu Chen instantly saw an intense light emanating from it. The crystal ball that showed no reaction to Mu Chen’s will had turned into a mini-sun that emitted a dazzling lustre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was speechless at this scene. But he was still somewhat optimistic, it’s just that he felt a little unhappy. That damnable crystal ball did not react to him but had reacted so intensely towards Zhantai Liuli. Did it prefer ladies over guys?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that crystal ball emitted a dazzling lustre, Zhantai Liuli was extremely excited and couldn’t maintain her calm. She had excitedly opened her eyes and looked at that crystal ball with splendour in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I succeeded?” Zhantai Liuli muttered as her eyes turned a little red, she was extremely excited at this moment. Her talent in Spiritual Energy wasn’t high and if it wasn’t for the huge resources of the Divine Pavilion, she wouldn’t even be able to reach the Fourth Grade Sovereign Realm. Therefore, she knew that the path of Spiritual Energy wasn’t suitable for her to become strong. So only being a Battle Formation Master could allow her to become powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She couldn’t imagine how desperate would she be if her only path was blocked. The Divine Pavilion destroyed her clan and forcefully brought her back to the Divine Pavilion because they had an eye on her talent in Battle Will. But if she couldn’t become a Battle Formation Master, then the Divine Pavilion might not even cast a glance at her. At that point in time, she and her clan would’ve been in peril.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, fortunately, the heavens had closed all the doors and left a window open. Her final possible path had finally welcomed her with open arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had also opened his eyes and looked at Zhantai Liuli, whose eyes had turned red from the excitement. He was briefly stunned, before becoming silent. It looked like she had many stories behind that silhouette of hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She clearly required that Will Technique more than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought that, the traces of pity that Mu Chen felt in his heart had disappeared. Although becoming a Battle Formation Master was pretty good, it wasn’t the only path for Mu Chen. It merely granted him more cards up his sleeves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he couldn’t become a Battle Formation Master, Mu Chen wouldn’t feel despair. Furthermore, since the Will Technique of the Sky Formation Emperor wasn’t suitable for him, that didn’t mean that the Sky Formation Emperor’s Will Technique was the only one for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you’re really fated with me.” The Sky Formation Emperor smiled towards Zhantai Liuli and his gaze turned even more gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks, Senior!” Zhantai Liuli said with her reddened eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Formation Emperor waved his hand and the crystal flew out. Turning into a streak of light that shot into the centre of Zhantai Liuli’s brows and swiftly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the crystal ball entered the centre of Zhantai Liuli’s brows, her figure jolted and she slightly knitted her brows. Clearly, she had felt additional pieces of information in her mind at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have sealed it in your mind and you can look at it at any time you want. Many of my experiences are left in it, so you can learn from those. I cannot teach you side by side, and you have to walk your future road alone.” The Sky Formation Emperor gently said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli bowed, “Thank you, teacher.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had already changed her form of address for the Sky Formation Emperor intelligently. From a certain angle, she was the inheritor of the Sky Formation Emperor now that she had obtained his inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha.” Hearing her form of address, the Sky Formation Emperor couldn’t help laughing as he nodded his head, “Good. I never expected to have an inheritor before I died. I hope that my line will greatly blossom in your hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli obediently nodded her head but shortly after, she was a little awkward and looked at Mu Chen. That’s because the latter still maintained a stance with his hands behind his back and did not get anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Formation Emperor looked at Mu Chen as well and briefly pondered. “There are four crystals remaining. Why don’t you try and see if you’re compatible with them. These are all obtained by me during the Primordial Age. Don’t think that I merely picked them up, the techniques held in these four crystals all have earth-shaking names. If it wasn’t for them being damaged, they would definitely far exceed the Will Technique I left behind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Mu Chen was stunned as he looked at the four remaining crystal balls with shock. He originally thought that they were just ordinary goods, he did not expect them to have such origins.</span></p>

Along his way here, he had gotten quite a bit of incomplete stuff. The Great Solar Undying Body that he had cultivated was a lacking version of the Primordial Immortal Body. Therefore, he was somewhat interested in things that weren’t completed.</span></p>
