 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1286 - Two Spiritual Arrays</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another month later, Mu Chen, who was in the prison, slowly opened up his eyes, unleashing a shine that looked as deep as the starry sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze flickered and only returned to normal a long time later as a white mist blew out of Mu Chen’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the mist came out, it did not dissipate but gathered in another direction into a tiny Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a simple Spiritual Array, but it was created with Mu Chen’s breath. Just this alone, one could tell that Mu Chen had obtained a vast increment in his attainments of Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, he definitely couldn’t accomplish this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a pity… that I’m only half a step to breaking through to the High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar Realm.” Mu Chen looked at the Spiritual Array that was formed of white mist before it gradually disappeared and regretfully sighed. However, this regret merely lasted for an instant before it vanished, since Mu Chen could sense the stunning raise in his understanding of Spiritual Arrays over the past two months. It wasn’t as easy as he had imagined to break through to the High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a premonition that as long as he comprehended the comprehension and experiences that his mother had given him, breaking into the High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar was just a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, even if he did not make a breakthrough, he knew that he already had the qualifications to attempt Spiritual Arrays of a High Rank Scholar. It’s just that the chances of success would vary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, he had benefited greatly. Not only would it allow him to break through to High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar soon, but he had also started to comprehend towards the direction of Spiritual Array Ancestor. It would be hugely beneficial and save him many troubles in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention that his mother had also left two important things for him, two Spiritual Array Diagrams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first was a High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar Spiritual Array, the Soaring Flame Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the second one, it’s even more terrifying, as that was a Spiritual Array Ancestor Realm Spiritual Array, Solar Annihilation Array!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just the name itself made Mu Chen inwardly smack his lips. He yearned to know the decimating power of that Spiritual Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, this sort of Spiritual Array was something that even a Heavenly Sovereign would be fearful of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity that he could only comprehend a High Rank Scholar Spiritual Array. As for the Ancestor Spiritual Array, Mu Chen’s heart trembled when he tried looking at it once. Not to mention attempting, he didn’t even have a clue on how to arrange it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, such a Spiritual Array was still far away from him. In the end, he could only let it stay in his mind until the time came for him to study it. But right now, the important thing for him was to comprehend the Soaring Flame Array completely. Once he could successfully arrange it, then breaking through to the High Rank Scholar Realm was just a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With all sorts of thoughts in his mind, Mu Chen lowered his head to the blackstone and smiled. “Mother, don’t worry. The day when I become the Spiritual Array Ancestor, will be the day when I will fetch you from the Ancient Buddha clan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, he would even be able to compete with a Heavenly Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After gently placing his hands to the ground, he no longer lingered. He stood up and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the pavilion, Mu Chen suddenly appeared before Luo Li and Ling Xi with their eyes flashed with joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is it?” Ling Xi asked as he looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just one step away.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ling Xi heard that, she wasn’t disappointed, but she lightly nodded her head. She had been focused on the path of Spiritual Arrays for a long time, so she naturally knew how difficult it was to break through to the High Rank Spiritual Array Scholar Realm. Even if Mu Chen had received the comprehension and experience of Aunt Ling, that kind of thing wasn’t something that Mu Chen could digest in merely two months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Mu Chen seemed to have also received quite a bit of harvest and seemed confident that he could break through that level soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can’t stay in this place any longer, let’s leave quickly.” Mu Chen looked at Luo Li and Ling Xi as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, this was the territory of the Ancient Buddha Clan. Although Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha had run away, if the Ancient Buddha Clan knew about this, they would surely send out more powerful experts to come and retrieve this island. Thus, they would be in trouble if they stayed here too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he’s strong now, he’s not arrogant. He knew that facing such a colossus like the Ancient Buddha Clan, facing them head-on was the most foolish way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Li and Ling Xi exchanged a glance before saying, “We’re planning to head to the Primordial Sacred Abyss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Primordial Sacred Abyss?” Mu Chen was stunned. He was unfamiliar with this location that they spoke of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a slight smile, Luo Li told Mu Chen everything about the Primordial Sacred Abyss, and also the matter of her agreeing with Celestial Chi Yan to join the selection of the Ancient Spirit Clan’s Holy Maiden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You promised him to compete for the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Spirit Clan?” Mu Chen was stunned after hearing Luo Li’s words, since he had ignored all the information regarding the Peerless Divine Abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew how intense the competition would be to become the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Spirit Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Mu Chen’s first concern about this, Luo Li felt a sweetness in her heart as she smiled. “The Ancient Spirit Clan has a deep foundation, and if I can become the Holy Maiden, it is also a great opportunity for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this was the reason that she had given, he understood her well. As someone similar to him, both of them were somewhat independent and confident in themselves. She had her own pride, so even if she had to rely on herself, she could also strive for the Heavenly Sovereign Realm, so she didn’t need any external help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, there was probably a greater reason behind her decision, it’s probably to grant him help in the future…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he looked at Luo Li with a complicated gaze, while the latter smiled and held onto his hand, since she had made her decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Mu Chen was also not someone unreasonable, so he would remember what Luo Li did for him, despite not saying anything. Regardless of anything, since she had made a decision, then he would do his best to help her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never thought that the Eight-Divisional Pagoda and Ancient Spirit Channelling Light would be in the Sacred Abyss. Those two Peerless Divine Abilities are something that trembled the Great Thousand World…” Only now did Mu Chen divert his attention to the two Peerless Divine Abilities and was instantly speechless. As someone that had cultivated the Three Pures of the 36 Divine Abilities as well, he understood the terrifying power that a Peerless Divine Ability possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing such a Divine Ability, not to mention him, even Heavenly Sovereigns would be tempted by it. Otherwise, the Ancient Buddha Clan and Ancient Spirit Clan wouldn’t put so much effort into obtaining the two Peerless Divine Abilities back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I can obtain the Eight-Divisional Pagoda, then I might be able to confront a Heavenly Sovereign when I’m in the Perfected Earth Sovereign Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen’s gaze flickered, since he knew the gulf between the Perfected Earth Sovereign and Heavenly Sovereign Realm. However, the Peerless Divine Ability should be able to make up for the gap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh, you’re pretty imaginative. Those Young Masters of the Ancient Buddha Clan are after the Eight-Divisional Pagoda, as well. How will it be easy for you to seize it from them?” Celestial Chi Yan had instantly seen through Mu Chen’s thoughts and chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Mu Chen was considered outstanding, he still lacked the support of the Ancient Buddha Clan. Compared to those Young Masters that have been enjoying the resources of the Ancient Buddha Clan, he’s still a little lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in response to Celestial Chi Yan, Mu Chen smiled. “How will we know who will be the last one smiling if we don’t try?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Celestial Chi Yan was a little surprised at Mu Chen’s reaction. He clearly did not expect the latter to have such a calm mentality at his young age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, you’re pretty good. If it’s not for you having the Ancient Buddha Clan’s bloodline, this old might want to recruit you into the Ancient Spirit Clan.” Celestial Chi Yan rubbed his beard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Mu Chen could reach his current level at such a young age, it’s most likely something that the other Young Masters of the Ancient Buddha Clan could not achieve if they did not have the resources of the clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I really wish to see the expression of those stubborn fellows when you reach the Heavenly Sovereign Realm… Haha, those geezers have been saying that my Ancient Spirit Clan has not followed the ancient teachings and contaminated our noble bloodline…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Celestial Chi Yan’s appearance, Mu Chen was also helpless before he cupped his fists together. “Senior Chi Yan, I’ll have to trouble you to allow me to enter the Primordial Sacred Abyss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is something that this old man has promised Luo Li. However, I will only send the two of you in. As for whether the two of you can obtain the Eight-Divisional Pagoda and the Ancient Spirit Channeling Light, it will depend on your fortunes.” Celestial Chi Yan waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen nodded his head. “Then, when can we move out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s not delay, and we’ll go now!” Celestial Chi Yan swiftly moved and waved his hand. The crimson gourd rapidly expanded to a hundred feet before he disappeared and appeared on the gourd in the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen, Luo Li, Ling Xi, and Long Xiang swiftly followed behind and they went up to the gourd as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Off we go!” Celestial Chi Yan laughed as the crimson gourd trembled. Space before him distorted into a spatial vortex and the gourd flew in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen sat on the gourd and looked at the crimson gourd traveling through space with an indescribable flash of light in his eyes. “The Young Masters of the Ancient Buddha Clan…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what, you guys are not getting the Eight-Divisional Pagoda.”</span></p>
