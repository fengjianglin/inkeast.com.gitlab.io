 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere within the devastated mountain range was no longer as lively as before. Following the conclusion of the great battle, the various powerful groups that had converged in this region had started to quietly disperse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing on top of a mountain peak, Mu Chen looked towards the horizon, which had cleared up, before turning around to look at the bevy of young girls behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three groups of the Myriad Phoenix Spiritual Academy had gathered together. This group of young girls had pretty and beautiful appearances, their gurgling laughters radiated with youthfulness and vitality. Such a spectacle caused Xu Huang and the other two to involuntarily flutter their gazes over and over again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tsk, tsk. I really never imagined that you would become this strong after a period of two months. You truly leave people dumbfounded,” said an enchanting and voluptuous girl with a grin as she walked over. She was the person that Mu Chen had bumped into not too long after the start of the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, Tang Mei’er. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, her beautiful eyes were suffused with rays of brilliance as she stared right at Mu Chen. When they had initially bumped into one another, Mu Chen’s cultivation was merely at the realm of Heavenly Completion Stage Late Phase. However, as of now, he had already passed his Spiritual Energy Disaster. Furthermore, what’s more terrifying was that his true combat prowess was on a level that even experts at First Grade Spirit Disaster were hard-pressed to match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a rate of progress was truthfully astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the matter? Have you two met before, Elder Sister Mei’er?” asked Wen Qingxuan in a somewhat astonished manner. From the looks of it, Tang Mei’er seemed to have not mentioned about having met Mu Chen and his group before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Proceeding to suspiciously stare at Mu Chen, she continued probing, “He didn’t bully you all, did he?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen’s face instantly turned black as he shot a vicious glare at Wen Qingxuan. However, the young girl before his eyes did not pay any notice to his threat. On the contrary, she raised her sharp, snow-white chin up in a haughty hoist, appearing just like a queen looking down on her subjects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe. With Little Sister Luo Li around, he won’t even have the courage to do so,” replied Tang Mei’er with a lovable laugh while she covered her red lips with her jade-like hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Luo Li gave a faint smile in response, her clear and limpid eyes gently sweeping across to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The play acted out by the three girls instantly caused Mu Chen’s head to swell. Breaking Xiao Huang’s Spiritual Array and dealing with Mo Xiu and the Multi-Academy Alliance appeared much easier, like a heaven’s dream, than to deal with the three girls before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the somewhat depressed appearance extruded by Mu Chen, the three girls could not help gently laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, your charm’s pretty good, and your taste is also very high. Could it be that you’ve taken a fancy for the most prideful and beautiful phoenix of our Myriad Phoenix Spiritual Academy?” Stealthily moving close to Mu Chen, Tang Mei’er said with a soft laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, there’s an extremely high degree of difficulty in this. This lass, Qingxuan’s too prideful. I’m afraid that you won’t be able to make her submit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen being somewhat unable to endure this provocative and straightforward set of words from Tang Mei’er, instantly caused an embarrassed shade to appear on his face. Shooting a look at Wen Qingxuan, who was currently chatting with Luo Li, he said with a dry laugh, “Please don't joke around, Elder Sister Mei’er. I truly don’t have any intent to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was extremely clear that Wen Qingxuan did not have any interest in him. On the contrary, she was interested in Luo Li. Therefore, from a certain perspective, Mu Chen still had to be cautious towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nevertheless, I pity my Little Sister Qian’er. Thinking about a certain somebody all day long in the Myriad Phoenix Spiritual Academy. However, that certain someone is imprisoned in a cluster of flowers, while being extremely satisfied with himself,” said Tang Mei’er as she shot a look at Mu Chen with her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen felt that her gaze appeared to treat him akin to a heinous traitor, resulting in him being only able to give a bitter laugh in response. In the face of this, even giving an explanation would not be able to clear up the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Next up, what are you planning to do?” However, at this moment, Wen Qingxuan and Luo Li had walked over. Shooting a look at Mu Chen. a serious expression appeared on the latter’s lovable face as she shot a question towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen started to deeply ponder awhile. As of now, the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament had started to somewhat enter its final phase. It’s this phase where the fights and battles would become the most intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the countless groups present, only a mere eight, a number that could be counted with one’s fingers would be able to enter the final match at the very end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, for the sake of obtaining one of those eight quotas, any group that possessed some level of strength would bet and risk their lives for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Earlier on, Ji Xuan had sent Mo Xiu and the others to feel you out. In fact, this should be considered as sending a challenge to you. Are you going to head out and aim straight for him?” asked Wen Qingxuan with a slight knit appearing on her forehead. “However, I have to remind you about something. That Ji Xuan fellow has extremely deep schemes and plans floating around in his head. As of now, there are quite a few of the powerful groups placed in the Top 16 that can be considered as part of his alliance…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Mu Chen slightly raised his eyebrows upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Strictly speaking, the three groups that you have dealt with earlier aren’t considered to be a part of Ji Xuan’s alliance. They merely owed a favor to Ji Xuan, that’s all. In my understanding of Ji Xuan, I’m afraid that there’s even an extremely high possibility of him creating the situation in which the debt was owed,” said Wen Qingxuan in a deep voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen nodded his head in agreement. With the schemes and plans of Ji Xuan, it wasn’t difficult for him to arrange for such a matter to occur. Furthermore, it really fits his character extremely well. Therefore, Mo Xiu and the other two Captains that appeared today might just be merely his scouting chess pieces, no more than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As of now, who else is part of Ji Xuan?” asked Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Rank 10, Lu Tian. He’s from the Heavens Spiritual Academy. That’s another top ranking Spiritual Academy. Naturally, the most important matter is that Lu Tian and his group have obtained quite a large benefit from the remnants in this Shattered Continent,” replied Wen Qingxuan as she shot a look at Mu Chen. “Have you heard about the Bone Sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At a loss, Mu Chen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Bone Sect should be one of the elite regional influences of the shattered continent in the Ancient Antiquity. Their strength and background were not much weaker than the Divine Wood Palace,” replied Luo Li with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen shrugged his shoulders in helplessness. Both Wen Qingxuan and Luo Li had extraordinary backgrounds, with the information they knew naturally being much more than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Li’s experienced and knowledgable,” said Wen Qingxuan as she shot a smile towards Luo Li, before continuing with her reply. “The Luo Tian’s group from the Heavens Spiritual Academy has obtained the inheritance of this Bone Sect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In addition, there’s the Rank 8, Wang Jiang. He’s from the Myriad Beasts Spiritual Academy. Similarly, he has obtained the inheritance of the Demonic Alligator Palace. That Demonic Alligator Palace is another tyrannical influence present on the Shattered Continent during the Ancient Antiquity. Therefore, as of now, they really are quite strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly nodded his head in response. From the looks of it, it seems that his group wasn’t the only ones that had obtained good fortune in the Shattered Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are they considered to be part of Ji Xuan’s alliance?” asked Mu Chen with slightly narrowed eyes. From the looks of it, Ji Xuan had really made quite some consideration in this. The people that he had roped in weren’t just any simple and ordinary figures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slightly nodding her head, Wen Qingxuan replied, “As of now, Lu Tian and Wang Jiang can be considered to be people that possess much fame and reputation within the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament. However, there is a bigger heavyweight present within Ji Xuan’s alliance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen’s eyes instantly slightly narrowed. That Lu Tian as well as that Wang Jiang have already reached 10th place and 8th place respectively. However, there’s actually a bigger heavyweight than them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Qingyun, from the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy. He’s also a genius from the Wind Spirit Clan. It’s said that the Azure Heavens Spiritual Academy has purposefully borrowed him from the Wind Spirit Clan,” replied Wen Qingxuan as her exquisite-looking face grew slightly solemn.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Mu Chen’s eyes had started to slowly narrow, while slight shock appeared within his heart. He never expected that Ji Xuan would actually be able to pull one of the five Great Academies over to his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Mu Chen had heard a few rumors about this Liu Qingyun. He’s an existence that absolutely able to contend for the final eight quotas. Added with Ji Xuan, such a lineup would absolutely be not one bit weaker than the collaboration between himself and Wen Qingxuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although they are usually fighting for their own respective benefits. Once they encounter an unapproachable trouble, they would collaborate. Furthermore, from my estimations, they would definitely collaborate to deal with you,” said Wen Qingxuan in a soft voice. After all, she also knew about the deep grudges and grievances between him and Ji Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a good move by Ji Xuan,” said Mu Chen in a calm manner. After so many years of not seeing the former, Ji Xuan’s getting more and more experienced in playing this move of forming alliances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Therefore, I wouldn't advise you to immediately head out and find trouble with Ji Xuan. You wouldn’t have much superiority if you choose to do so,” said Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen slightly nodded his head in response. Knowing all too well about how thorny Ji Xuan was. Regardless of how formidable he himself was, he wouldn’t be able to succeed in dealing with such an alliance just by relying on themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Therefore, what do you plan on doing now?” After explaining the situation, Wen Qingxuan shot one more question at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen started laughing. Retrieving his Academy Plaque, he looked towards the names sparkling with brilliance present on its surface. Finally, extending his finger out, he gave a gentle tap on its surface before replying, “There isn’t much to consider about. Since Ji Xuan’s trying his best to construct this kind of alliance to trap me, we naturally can’t just sit here and await death.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For instance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For instance, when those claws of his are still trying to obtain more points to solidify their places on the rankings…” At this moment, a faint chilling light started to circulate within Mu Chen’s black pupils as he slowly clenched his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll start by completely removing all those claws of his!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s reply, Wen Qingxuan raised her slender eyebrows in response. At this moment, her bright phoenix-like eyes were brimming with interest as she stared at Mu Chen. The originally handsome face of the youth now appeared much more serene and deep. This caused him to appear as if he was a lion that had tensed its body up, and was on the verge of lunging straight at its prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you interested in earning some points?” said Mu Chen as he shot a faint smile towards Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flinging her little rosy mouth, Wen Qingxuan replied, “Just speak straight to the point, you need a free hired thug. Why the need for such fanciful words?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone has their needs,” replied Mu Chen with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan was unable to refute with his reply. After some slight pondering, she nodded her head and said, “Since I owe you a favor for the earlier matter, I’ll help you this time to pay this back. Furthermore, that Ji Xuan fellow is someone that I quite dislike. Being able to create some trouble for him isn’t harmful for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen gave a laugh, before doing a slow stretch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Ji Xuan had already started to make a move on him, he need not to show any mercy anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Xuan, our confrontation has officially started…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ll uproot&nbsp;every single one of the claws that you’ve painstakingly roped in!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, let this mission be called the tooth extraction mission!</span></p>
