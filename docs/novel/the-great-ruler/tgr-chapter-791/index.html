Under the dragon roar and phoenix cry, the blood in his body started to boil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dazzling golden light spread out from the centre of Mu Chen’s brows. In just an instant, it had spread throughout every single corner of Mu Chen’s body. As the golden light was fusing with his blood and flesh, an intense burning pain immediately spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That intense pain had directly caused Mu Chen’s face to distort. His body was constantly trembling as traces of blood oozed from his pores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That small drip of dark-gold blood essence was extremely overbearing. It was trying to incinerate all the blood in Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that scene was clearly not what Mu Chen wanted to see, he wanted to fuse them and not incinerate one of them. Because if his blood was truly incinerated, it would give him a heavy injury. At that time, when the blood essence of the dragon and phoenix becomes the main instead of a sub, his body might be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’ve entered my body, I don’t care what you are, but behave!” Mu Chen clenched his teeth as his heart tensed up. The Spiritual Energy in his body revolved. It was so much so that even the flow of blood in his body had accelerated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that he absolutely could not cower at this moment. No matter how overbearing the blood essence of the dragon and phoenix was, he couldn’t allow them to incinerate his blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Traces of golden light shone in his blood and flesh, dying them gold. But under Mu Chen’s control, the blood in his body had retaliated under the help of his Spiritual Energy, suppressing that golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two started to fight in his body. Every single clash would cause his body to tremble, along with intense pain. It nearly made Mu Chen unable to bear it any longer and almost howled out. That’s because the pain was comparable to slicing his flesh. It was extremely unbearable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he already could not retreat at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wanted to form the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, he naturally had to face great danger as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking from outside Mu Chen’s body, one would notice that his body was emitting blood-red and golden colours. The two colours constantly came into contact as they attempted to devour the other party. Under the two lights, Mu Chen’s distorted face was especially sinister at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the blood essence of the dragon and phoenix was overbearing, it was weak by itself alone. Hence, this fight lasted for a long while, before the golden light retreated. Just as Mu Chen silently felt relieved, the Dragon-Phoenix Wheel above him started to shine with golden light and another drop of dragon-phoenix blood essence dropped onto the centre of his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen only had the time to curse in his heart, before he was covered with intense pain that surged over. He could only guard his mind and not allow his conscious to scatter by the intense pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Mu Chen had a wonderful taste of living death. Under his senses, his entire body was cut open from the fight. That feeling was as if his body was sliced with blades over and over again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not know how long the fight lasted, he only knew that he had lost his senses in the end and only had a trace of will that guarded his mind so that his consciousness wouldn’t be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when Mu Chen’s consciousness was in a blurry state, he did not know that along with every single fight in his body, there would be dark-golden blood traces that could be found throughout his body, outside his bones. A terrifying vitality was emitted as they wiggled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the surface of Mu Chen’s skin, there was a dark-gold lustre moving about. Faintly, there seem to be densely packed dark-golden scales appearing on his skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a drastic change throughout his body at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water level of this super Dragon-Phoenix Pool was constantly lowering. The initially dazzling golden light had become much darker. Clearly, it was caused by having a large amount of dragon and phoenix’s blood essences being absorbed by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao stood outside the Dragon-Phoenix Pool, looking at the water level that was constantly descending. Vaguely, Mu Chen’s figure, which sat at the bottom of it, could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, judging from the looks of it, it seemed like it had yet to end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The blood essences in this Dragon-Phoenix Pool can’t support the birth of the Dragon-Phoenix Physique.” Cai Xiao murmured to herself as she lightly frowned. She briefly pondered, before she grasped her hand and a Dragon-Phoenix Fruit with a dragon and phoenix intertwining on it appeared with a flash. A dazzling golden light burst out from it, like a small sun, filled with energy that could make others drool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The amount of dragon and phoenix blood essences required for the forming of the Dragon-Phoenix Physique had exceeded Cai Xiao’s expectations. If this continued, Mu Chen might not reach the most perfect state. Because the moment the blood essences of the dragon and phoenix run out, his cultivation would come to a stop. If he lost this chance, it wouldn’t be easy for him to reach that step anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Cai Xiao had decisively taken out a Dragon-Phoenix Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow is actually benefiting so cheaply.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao cast a glance at Mu Chen, who sat at the bottom of the pool, then lightly flung her lips. She flicked her finger and the Dragon-Phoenix Fruit instantly turned into a golden beam of light as it shot into the Dragon-Phoenix Wheel that was above Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the Dragon-Phoenix Fruit entered the Dragon-Phoenix Wheel, a dazzling golden light shot out in every direction. A golden pillar of light that was roughly a hundred feet in size soared, it could be clearly seen from anywhere within a thousand miles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ancient draconic roar and phoenix cry rang out from the huge pillar of light that resonated between the heavens and earth. It was as if there was a True Dragon and Phoenix contained in that pillar of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The source of the golden pillar of light was Mu Chen, who was quietly seated. The dark-gold dragon and phoenix blood essence poured down like a small stream as it enveloped his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sizzle! Sizzle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Dragon-Phoenix blood essences poured down, Mu Chen’s skin looked like it was burning as an ear-piercing sizzling sound was being emitted. That feeling was as if the Blood Essences of the Dragon-Phoenix weren’t blood essences but magma that would soon melt metal…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surface of Mu Chen’s body violently trembled under the envelopment of the Dragon-Phoenix’s Blood Essences, enduring that endless pain with a deep roar. His fists violently smashed on the ground, which caused cracks to appear at the bottom of this Dragon-Phoenix Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao closely looked at that trembling figure and couldn’t help clenching her fists. She was prepared to forcefully drag Mu Chen out from that cultivation state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because if this situation continued, the instant Mu Chen couldn’t endure it anymore, then there was a high possibility that his body would be melted by the Dragon-Phoenix Blood Essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had all underestimated how tyrannical the blood essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Endure it.” Cai Xiao spoke with a low voice. If she forcefully dragged Mu Chen out from his cultivation state, then all of his effort from earlier would have been in vain, they would have even wasted a Dragon-Phoenix Fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This disadvantageous plan could only be used if there was an absolute need.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden pillar of light soared into the clouds and the dazzling golden light lasted for a few hours, but there still wasn’t any sign of it weakening. However, as time passed, the violent smashing noise had also stopped. Mu Chen’s body, which was violently trembling, was gradually calming down.</span></p>

Because she sensed that, at this moment, Mu Chen’s aura was swiftly weakening.</span></p>

She had directly appeared at the bottom of the pool and was about to pull Mu Chen out from the golden light.</span></p>

In the end, she could only gently stomp her foot and retracted her hand. Mu Chen’s tenacity had far exceeded her expectations.</span></p>

The hundred-foot light pillar had also shrunk down, bit by bit, turning into a fine ray of light as it disappeared.</span></p>

Directing her gaze over, Cai Xiao saw a human figure covered in golden crystals. That figure was like a fly in amber, his body was frozen, along with his distorted facial expression. The vitality had completely disappeared.</span></p>

Even she couldn’t sense Mu Chen’s aura at this moment. Therefore, she couldn’t tell if Mu Chen had succeeded or failed…</span></p>

In a few breaths’ time, the crack had covered the whole surface of the crystal…</span></p>

With a boom, the layers of golden crystal exploded, turning into golden light and shot out in every direction.</span></p>

His howl actually contained a dragon roar and phoenix cry resounding along with it. As the golden light spread out, a huge dragon and phoenix figure formed behind him that was faintly visible. A terrifying oppressive pressure had also spread out in this region.</span></p>
