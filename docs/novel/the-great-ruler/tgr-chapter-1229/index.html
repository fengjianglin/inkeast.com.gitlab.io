 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1229 - Ancient Land</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a lone peak behind the Luo God Palace, Mu Chen sat on an azure rock, welcoming the breeze fluttering his clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were closed and he formed seals with boundless Spiritual Energy whistling over. It was akin to a current and was being absorbed into Mu Chen’s body, as if his body was a bottomless pit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he entered the Earth Sovereign Realm, the amount of Spiritual Energy that Mu Chen could contain became unimaginable. Before the Earth Sovereign Realm, he could only store it in his Sovereign Sea. But after stepping into the Earth Sovereign Realm, his Sovereign Sea had disappeared, integrating into his body. So every single part of his body was akin to a Sovereign Sea. Thus, the capacity that he could contain naturally increased as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After cultivating for an hour, the commotion gradually calmed down and Mu Chen slowly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing the boundless Spiritual Energy flowing within his body, Mu Chen gently breathed out, but his gaze turned even more solemn when he recalled the information that Luo Li had given him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Four Holy Children of the West Heaven Temple…” Mu Chen muttered to himself. According to Luo Li, the first three Holy Children have slaughtered Greater Earth Sovereigns in the past, so they weren’t opponents that Mu Chen could underestimate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew the vast difference between defeating and killing Greater Earth Sovereigns. That’s because every Earth Sovereign had a powerful vitality, even if half of their body was destroyed, they could still recover from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing a Greater Earth Sovereign would mean that one would have to annihilate all of the life force contained within the body, just like how Mu Chen slaughtered that Lesser Earth Sovereign from the Blood God Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it wasn’t easy to achieve that. Reaching the Greater Earth Sovereign Realm, one could run even if they couldn’t beat their enemies, unless the other party had an overwhelming strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the three Holy Children of the West Heaven Continent could slaughter Greater Earth Sovereigns, that meant that their strength wasn’t in the range of ordinary Greater Earth Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the three Holy Children would definitely be an obstruction in the contest of the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seed&nbsp;</span>of the Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most important, he had grudges with the West Heaven Battle Emperor. Although the Battle Emperor wouldn’t make a move himself with the Flame Emperor being around, the three Holy Children would definitely make a move against him if they encountered one another on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, there’s no compromise between Mu Chen and the three Holy Children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to them, Liu Xingchen, Su Mu and Chu Men were slightly weaker, even though they had a history of defeating those of similar realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The West Heaven Continent is truly a hidden dragon, crouching tiger place.” Mu Chen sighed. Although the West Heaven Continent wasn’t a genuine supercontinent, it’s still stronger than the Greatlaw Continent with the existence of the West Heaven Battle Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So if he wanted to obtain one of the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seed&nbsp;</span>of the Continent’s quotas, a fierce battle was unavoidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because of that information that Mu Chen felt a little threatened in his heart. However, his determination hadn't wavered, since this opportunity was something that the Flame Emperor had fought for him. Therefore, he couldn’t give up so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen heavily breathed out and his eyes narrowed before both of his hands joined together, with fluctuations rippling out from his body. Instantly, he could sense his two clones in the Heavenly Lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing the miraculous link, Mu Chen felt at ease in his heart. Although the three Holy Children were powerful, he’s not a pushover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the Three Pures was one of his trump cards for dealing with a Greater Earth Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had never executed the Three Pures since he had cultivated it, but he had a premonition that he wouldn’t be disappointed by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had a Peerless Divine Ability as a trump card, Mu Chen did not feel complacent because of it. For security reasons, he needed more means to boost the success rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“More means…” Mu Chen pondered for a long time before opening his eyes with a flash of hesitation. That’s because he recalled a technique that he had been neglecting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Pagoda Art that was left by his mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s a foundation technique of the Ancient Buddha Clan. It’s incredibly profound and Mu Chen only briefly trained in it in the past. But in the end, he was afraid of revealing his identity, so he had left it aside. Now that he had stepped into the Earth Sovereign Realm, he also possessed some ability to protect himself. Perhaps it’s time for him to start training in it again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ancient Buddha Clan was one of the Ancient Clans of the Great Thousand World with a terrifying foundation. They’re a genuine colossi, so this Great Pagoda Art wouldn’t be simple as well. It was just his strength being too weak, so he couldn’t obtain any insight into the profundities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this moment, Mu Chen believed that his comprehension would be completely different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this thought, Mu Chen no longer hesitated and his hands joined together. The chant of the Great Pagoda Art had also started to resonate within his heart and the boundless Spiritual Energy in his body started to course through his meridians through the Great Pagoda Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Mu Chen circulated the Great Pagoda Art, boundless Spiritual Energy burst out from within his body. As Spiritual Energy gathered, a majestic black pagoda slowly formed within his body and he gradually submerged himself within the chant of the Great Pagoda Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen’s premonition did not fail him. He had stepped into the Earth Sovereign Realm, so the pieces of information that he couldn’t comprehend instantly cleared up. It was as if he had removed the veil of this profound technique and started to comprehend the profundities of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time gradually passed with Mu Chen submerged in comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without him knowing, a few days have passed, but he remained unmoving like a boulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Luo Li saw Mu Chen busy within his cultivation, she did not disrupt him and sat beside him for a long time before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time slowly passed, and ten days passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the tenth day, Mu Chen’s body suddenly trembled. He had been enlightened by the chant of the Great Pagoda Art with an unfamiliar chant echoing in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Destroying and guiding with your heart. Drawing the Ancestral Aura so that the Pagoda is genuine.” Mu Chen repeated the chant in his heart before an insight hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s the case…” Mu Chen muttered. The black pagoda started to crack with beams of light leaking through the cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was actually destroying the pagoda!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the cracks continued to cover the pagoda, it finally exploded and a dark light swept out, shining onto every corner of Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Guiding with your heart…” The chant flowed in his heart. At this moment, Mu Chen’s heart was filled with a dark light and his spiritual form gradually blurred. It was also under this meditating state that a vortex formed from the shattered location of the pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the vortex, Mu Chen briefly hesitated before he tossed out the hesitations in his heart and stepped in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The darkness before him only lasted briefly, and Mu Chen felt a distortion in his sense of time and space. As if in that instant, his spiritual form had been teleported to another location…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The darkness swiftly disappeared, and when Mu Chen opened his eyes, his eyes greatly rippled with a surprised mutter that rang out within his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where… is this?” His spiritual form was floating in the air and an ancient land appeared before his eyes, as if it was a mark that was left by time. However, what made Mu Chen’s heart tremble the most wasn’t this ancient land, but the massive pagoda that quietly stood in the centre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That pagoda was ancient and the marks on the body of the pagoda looked incredibly profound. Furthermore, it seemed to have transcended time and space, existing indefinitely through time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Chen’s spiritual form focused on the old pagoda, and he could sense an aura that was even stronger than a Heavenly Sovereign coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where… is this place?” Mu Chen’s heart trembled since he had no idea why the passage was formed when he shattered his pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, while Mu Chen was looking around this land, a quiet, sitting figure in the black pagoda abruptly opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her eyes that usually had no ripples flickered with tears at this moment.
