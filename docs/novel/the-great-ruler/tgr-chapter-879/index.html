 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heed my orders, Five Spirits Converge!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s roar thundered near the ears of every single warrior of the five troops. Hearing his roar, even with the nature of those warriors to heed orders, they couldn’t help being briefly stunned before showing hesitation in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the hesitation only flashed for a brief instant before they suppressed it with the clench of their teeth. As warriors that have been trained for years, they were required to heed any order as long as the Commander was still around, even if it was an order that they did not understand or couldn’t accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the warriors of the five troops suppressed the doubts in their hearts very quickly and the five Spirits of Battle Will roared, forming into beams of light and collided together in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five Spirits of Battle Will were clashing against each other!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment of collision, there was a loud explosion that rang out in the horizon and different colours of Battle Will spread out, forming into an extremely dazzling light sphere. It was a sphere of roughly myriads of feet. It’s just that the attributes in the light sphere were extremely different and were clashing together. Every single clash would bring forth a huge noise that even caused space to ripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the Battle Formation, the other forces were looking at this scene, dumbfounded. Only long while later did someone uncontrollably exclaim, “Is that Mu Chen crazy? He actually dared to mix together five different Battle Wills?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether and the Kings all exchanged looks and their countenances became a little pale, the shock in their eyes couldn’t he concealed as well. Clearly, this action of Mu Chen’s had exceeded their expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they did not have high attainments in the field of Battle Will, they were experts. So with their keen eyes, they knew how insane Mu Chen was at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was actually trying to mix five different Battle Wills together!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was absolutely an insane task to mix different energies together. Take Spiritual Energy for example, if they were to be forcefully mixed together, there would only be one outcome, the explosion of Spiritual Energy along with the explosion of the person…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Nine Nether didn’t know if that was the way with Spiritual Energy as well, but it was clearly extremely tough to achieve that step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Mu’s guts are too big…” The Mountain Splitting King moved his lips as he bitterly smiled. He naturally knew that if the five Battle Will Spirits could be mixed together, the might would definitely be much stronger than the five of them split apart. But it was easy to speak of it and doing it was filled with endless dangers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps a genuine Battle Formation Master might be able to combine different Battle Wills together. But right now, Mu Chen was not yet a genuine Battle Formation Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, that step was extremely dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But despite the commotion outside, it couldn’t affect Mu Chen, who was in the battle formation. Right now, Mu Chen had tightly shut his eyes and beads of sweat were constantly dripping from his face. It was so much so that even wriggling veins had popped out on his forehead and the centre of his brows was tightly knitted with pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, it was an extremely difficult matter for Mu Chen to combine five different Battle Wills together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But since he wanted to swiftly destroy the battle formation, he could only combine five Battle Wills and launch the strongest attack to destroy that Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit. Otherwise, if he’s dragged into a deadlock, perhaps Zhantai Liuli might be the first that could get past this battle formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was clear that Zhantai Liuli came prepared and she also had her Azure Troop. So in terms of Battle Will, she was superior than his five troops. Therefore, if the current situation continued, there was a high probability that she might get past the battle formation first. At that time, they would gain nothing after she had taken the Sky Formation Emperor’s inheritance along with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an outcome that Mu Chen did not wish to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he had to give it a risk, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no confidence in this matter, especially when he came in contact with the five Battle Wills. He could feel how strong the rejection was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had no methods to deal with that rejection, so he could only use the stupidest method: Fusing his mind in it and forcefully fuse the five Battle Wills together!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this method was also extremely exhausting to his mind. Just think about it, one consciousness flowing amongst tens of thousands of wills and those wills were rejecting each other. It would be an extremely great burden to the mind of a person. If it was another person attempting this, even an expert like the Kings would have their minds instantly wiped and suffer fatal damage to their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for Mu Chen being a Spiritual Array Master, whose mind was stronger than others and the five Battle Wills not rejecting Mu Chen, he wouldn’t dare to attempt this method, even if he was confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even so, he was suffering a head-splitting pain at this moment, as if his head was about to be blown apart. The veins on his forehead wriggled even faster, looking extremely horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the veins wiggled on Mu Chen’s forehead, the ten thousand-foot light sphere was constantly emitting brilliant colours and thunderous booming sounds rang out from the clashes of Battle Wills…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, just when Mu Chen was attempting to combine the five Battle Wills, the Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit had also sensed the threatening undulations coming from the light sphere and had emitted a roar. Its ferocious gaze was then fixed onto Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit shot its gaze at Mu Chen, Mu Chen’s body instantly trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately, the Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit flung its tail, causing a huge tear in space and was enveloping towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifying fluctuation came from the dark light. Judging from the fluctuation, not even an ordinary Sixth Grade Sovereign would dare to face it head-on, and at this moment, Mu Chen did not have any Battle Will protecting himself, while his own cultivation was just at Fourth Grade Sovereign. Therefore, such an attack could be considered as fatal to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit was extremely cunning and had grasped a good opportunity. It was just when Mu Chen was fusing the five Battle Wills and couldn’t split his attention to anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That scene had aroused countless exclamations outside the battle formation, even the faces of the Kings had drastically changed at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark light came too fast, practically not giving anyone the time to react and had already appeared before Mu Chen. The dreadful ripples had caused Mu Chen to feel an intense pain all over his body as he clenched his teeth in the next instant and formed seals with his hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Great Solar Undying Body!</span></p>

Instantly, a dazzling light burst out and the Great Solar Undying Body appeared to be on the verge of being destroyed!</span></p>

His face was as pale as paper. He lowered his head and looked at his shoulder, which was dripping with blood, with lingering fear in his eyes.</span></p>

It was the True Dragon tattoo. But the True Dragon tattoo was extremely dimmed at this moment, since it had helped Mu Chen to resist a blow.

If he still had the protection of the Spirits of Battle Will, then that attack of the Black Tortoise Battle Will Spirit wouldn’t have been able to harm him. But losing the Spirits of Battle Will, it was extremely hard for him to confront that Black Tortoise Battle Will with his strength at the Fourth Grade Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
