 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the depths of the magma ocean, magma was violently torn apart from a swift speed as a huge sound rang out. Within that huge sound, a figure enveloped in dark-purple flames was swiftly streaking across.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away from the escaping light figure, magma was torn apart by a ferocious scorpion-serpent, pursuing at a stunning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the scorpion-serpent was large in size, its speed was like a ghost that raised a chill in the hearts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was fleeing while the other was pursuing, it was naturally Mu Chen and the mysterious scorpion-serpent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Mu Chen had an extremely unsightly expression on his face, since he never expected to be so unlucky. He had just dive down to the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond and had intruded into the territory of this scorpion-serpent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, not to mention about hunting other Spiritual Fire Pythons, it would be great if he wasn’t killed by this scorpion-serpent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Escape first!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen clenched his teeth and further increased his speed. He could sense the great pressure coming from his rear, which made him understand the fact that he could not confront this mysterious scorpion-serpent with his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Chen quickening his speed in his escape, the mysterious scorpion-serpent wasn’t in a rush at all, but was emitting a rather leisure hiss. Judging from the looks of it, it seemed to have treated Mu Chen as a meal that was already on its plate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man and scorpion-serpent were swiftly streaking across in the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond. Along the way, they had encountered a decent number of Spiritual Fire Pythons. However, upon sensing the pressure coming from the mysterious scorpion-serpent behind Mu Chen, they instantly fled, a scene which made Mu Chen’s heart colder because that meant that this scorpion-serpent wasn’t ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That meant that he had provoked an Overlord here…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen wanted to cry, but there were no tears. Before he could lament on his misfortune, there were sharp breakings of wind that resounded from his rear, which made his hairs stand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He cast a glance at the corner of his eyes and saw a scarlet light shooting in his direction. A sharp tail of a scorpion that would make others that cast their eyes on it to feel their scalp numb flickered with a cold lustre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen grasped his hand and the Great Meru Demonic Pillar flew out in flickers. Shortly after, his hand danced out and heavily clashed with the scorpion tail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A metallic sound burst out as a terrifying surge of energy swept out, causing blood to flow from the web on Mu Chen’s palm, along with a smear of blood hanging on the corner of his lips. His body was sent flying by the overbearing power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow’s strength is comparable to a Sixth Grade Sovereign, at the very least!” Mu Chen was shocked deep in his heart. This casual attack had caused him such injuries. Even amongst the Kings in the Great Havenlaw Domain, this mysterious scorpion-serpent’s strength could be considered as formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant of contact, Mu Chen thoroughly knew how powerful the mysterious scorpion-serpent was. He did not dare to have anymore contact and borrowed the power from the collision to shoot out once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scorpion-serpent still closely followed with a speed that wasn’t fast nor slow. No matter how Mu Chen pushed his speed, he could not break free from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, Mu Chen’s expression became more and more unsightly, since he sensed that the scorpion-serpent was treating him like a prey that it was messing with, wanting to exhaust him completely before capturing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze constantly changed as a ferociously light gathered. Although this scorpion-serpent was formidable, it did not have any intelligence. If Mu Chen was to go all-out, he might have a chance to break free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Except that he would have the pay a certain price as well. But if it came to that step, he also couldn’t care about that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen clenched his teeth and had decided to risk his life. Just when he was about to burst out his Spiritual Energy, the magma was torn apart before him as a light figure swiftly flew in his direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The coming figure left Mu Chen briefly stunned, but when he focused his gaze over, he was completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because that light figure was a lady that wore thin clothing that revealed a large amount of her fair skin. She had a head of red hair and an ample, voluptuous figure. Even if his current situation wasn’t optimistic, his blood flow still increased from looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, she had an enchanting face, with a mole hanging on the corner of her lips, which made this girl even more alluring and bewitching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden appearance of this beauty in the depths of this Greatlaw Blaze Pond had left Mu Chen briefly stunned, even his speed had slowed down as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen had his attention on the red-haired beauty, the latter had also noticed him and a smear of astonishment appeared on her bewitching face. At the same time when she was astonished, she also saw the pursuing mysterious scorpion-serpent behind Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quick, flee!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen quickly yelled at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he had yelled out, he stopped as well and his eyes froze while looking behind the red-haired beauty. Because over there, magma was torn apart as a giant three-headed python was emanating a torrential ferocious aura as it chased over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the Spiritual Energy fluctuation that was emitting from the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python wasn’t at all inferior to the scorpion-serpent behind Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Mu Chen instantly understood that the red-haired beauty was the same as him, being pursued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re doomed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen wanted to cry, but there were no tears. He had run into all sorts of unfortunate matters today. If it was only a scorpion-serpent, he might still be able to escape at the risk of his life. But now, there was a Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python that wasn’t inferior to the scorpion-serpent, which made him helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red-haired beauty wasn’t as pessimistic as Mu Chen. Her bewitching gaze cast a glance at the scorpion-serpent behind Mu Chen. She briefly pondered, before abruptly charging out and appeared before Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A breeze of fragrance blew over. Before Mu Chen could be intoxicated by it, the beauty had already stretched her hand out and held onto Mu Chen’s waist. With a rustle, they had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two figures appeared a few hundred feet away. The red-haired beauty waved her hand, gathering magma over and condensed it into a magma sphere that enveloped the two of them, leaving a gap open for them to observe the situation outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the narrow and scarlet environment, Mu Chen did not dare to move his body because the lady in his embrace was like a snake that was stuck in his embrace. That softness and tenderness made his body stiff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because judging from the Spiritual Energy fluctuations that were being emitted from the instant of bursting out, he knew that this red-haired lady wasn’t a simple person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the red-haired lady clearly did not have the heart to pay attention to Mu Chen, since her alluring eyes were closely staring up above. When the two of them disappeared, the scorpion-serpent and Three-headed Spiritual Python had lost their targets. They both stopped and stared at each other with gazes filled with ferocity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was also staring at this scene and couldn’t help asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The one chasing after you is called the Fire Dragon Scorpion, an Overlord in this Greatlaw Blaze Pond, one that specially devours Spiritual Fire Pythons. And the Three-headed Spiritual Fire Python is also an Overlord amongst the Spiritual Fire Pythons. So they are natural enemies. The moment they meet each other, it will not end without one of them dying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red-haired lady continued speaking without turning her head back, “Looks like our luck is pretty good that we actually managed to lure them together. We’ll wait till the two of them are gravely injured, before harvesting. Haha, I have been drooling over their Spiritual Fire Marrows for a long time, and now, I finally have an opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was covered in cold sweat upon hearing her words. This big sister was truly bold to actually have thoughts of letting those two fight while they benefited from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will not be discovered, right?” Mu Chen worriedly asked. If those two monsters had their eyes on them, then they would be doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right now, they have encountered their natural enemy, so they will not notice us,” said the red-haired lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, only then did Mu Chen feel relieved. Thereafter, he sensed that the lady in his embrace seemed to have come closer. Immediately, he shrunk his body back and said, “Should I leave first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you leave here, you will be noticed by them and land yourself in trouble.” The red-haired lady frowned her brows, before turning her head and cast a glance at Mu Chen, and said with lifted brows, “You’re from the Great Havenlaw Army? Why have I not seen you before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ruler left me here to train.” Mu Chen answered honestly. Judging from the looks of this, this red-haired lady seemed to be someone from the Great Havenlaw Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are?” Mu Chen asked cautiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Huo Mei’er.” The red-haired lady paused, before revealing an alluring smile towards Mu Chen. “Furthemore, I am also the Great Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her words, Mu Chen was frightened to the point that his hand trembled and was a little dumbfounded. He clearly did not expect that the Great Commander of the Great Havenlaw Army to be such an alluring lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Brother is rather honest, letting you have an advantage right now. But if this matter was known to a third person, then don’t blame this Big Sister for silencing your mouth.” Huo Mei’er chuckled as she stretched out her hand and patted Mu Chen’s face. When she said the last part, it even frightened Mu Chen till he was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Huo Mei’er might seem passionate and was a person easy to get close with, but the dangerous level that she gave him was stronger than Commander Bing Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finishing her words, Huo Mei’er no longer paid any attention to Mu Chen and looked at the two giant figures outside, before her figure got closer to Mu Chen again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen painfully pulled his lips. In the end, he couldn’t be bothered anymore. His arm went numb and fell onto the slim waist of the lady in his embrace. The soft sensation made him unable to bear the thought of letting go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not move his hand. Placing it on her waist, he relaxed his body and looked outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Mei’er’s body also unnoticeably trembled when Mu Chen placed his hands on her waist. The corners of her eyes gave Mu Chen a glare. But the latter’s black pupils were clear, only then did she gradually relax and her soft body stuck closer to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the narrow environment, danger quietly faded with a trace of loveliness that was flavourful.</span></p>
