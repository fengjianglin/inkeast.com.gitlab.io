 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen flew off of the stone platform under the countless gazes that were filled with fear. He returned to the side of Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan as he smiled towards the two girls, “By luck, I was able to accomplish it. I suppose that I was not too embarrassing, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li smiled as she nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So-so, there’s nothing to smirk about. If it was me who was in your position, there was no way that the puppet could force me to such an extent.” Wen Qingxuan’s lips rose. Her pride wouldn’t allow her to admit that Mu Chen truly was powerful. Although he was still somewhat capable for being able to defeat the puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly smiled. After all, there was still some distance between his cultivation and Wen Qingxuan. If he possessed the strength of Spiritual Energy Disaster, it would be much easier for him to deal with the puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So are you guys going to try out as well?” Mu Chen looked towards Luo Li, Wen Qingxuan, Xu Huang and the rest. According to the rules of the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, he had already succeeded his challenge and obtained the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi. Therefore, he could not challenge again. However, Luo Li and the rest still had a chance. There were still quite a bit of rare Spiritual Treasures in the Spiritual Treasure Mountain. If they could obtain them, their strength could have quite a bit of increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan and Luo Li nodded without hesitation. Since they were already here, they could not return empty-handed. Although Mu Chen had already taken the best that the Spiritual Treasure Mountain could offer, the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi, there were still other precious treasures that are worth quite a decent amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can as well?” Xu Huang, and the other two hesitated as they exchanged looks. After all, the consequences to their failure was too dire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Challenge according to your strengths. As long as you guys don’t aim too high, it should still be possible for success.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good!” Xu Huang and the other two grounded their teeth. Wen Qingxuan and her team of girls did not plan to give up. If they were scared of it, it would be too shameful for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen spoke, the atmosphere outside the Spiritual Treasure Mountain became lively. The miserable situation that they had seen seemed to have been dulled by a lot when Mu Chen took his victory. Some people regained their rationality. Although they did not dare to challenge rashly, they started to obtain some Spiritual Treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw that the mood of the other teams was recovering, he smiled as he urged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan nodded their heads. Shortly after, their figures turned into streaks of light and charged towards the eighth level of the Spiritual Treasure Mountain. Only this level was something that they could consider, since the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi had already been taken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing as Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan had acted, Pin’er, Le’er and An Ya had also acted. They chose the sixth level, since the puppets on that level possessed the strength of Spiritual Energy Disaster. With the sufficient amount of methods that they had, there was nothing that they would fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Huang and the other two, however, were slightly weaker compared to them. Therefore, they could only choose the fifth level, since the puppets there possessed the strength of Human Body Disaster. It was something that they could manage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their actions had broken the atmosphere in this region as the other teams could not hold back and also turned into streaks of light as they flew into the Spiritual Treasure Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among those groups, the speed of Wang Zhong and Wu Yingying was the fastest as they entered the eighth level. Clearly, they had confidence in their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, the atmosphere in the Spiritual Treasure Mountain became heated up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ferocious battles broke out from the stone platform. However, the current situation was much better. After estimating the strength of the puppets, the chances of victory rose. Aside from a few unfortunate fellows that could not perform in the battle, a majority of them clenched victory and obtained a Spiritual Treasure of their choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gales swept out from the stone platform from the many joyful faces. Outside the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, the entire region was filled with celebration. Naturally, there were some who were dejected and depressed. The faces of those pale-faced teams lost their teammates without being able to obtain any Spiritual Treasures and had lost them to imprisonment. So as to say, their steps in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament were halted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan also returned with victory. Although the puppets that they faced were powerful, they did not possess the strength of First Grade Spirit Disaster. Therefore, it was easy for them to clench their victory. It was two complete situations, compared to Mu Chen’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you guys get?” Mu Chen was a little curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li smiled as light gathered in her hand. A jadestone lotus platform appeared and within it was a fiery-red vine. The vine was like a scarlet dragon, since there were small scales one the surface on the vine. Within the vine, there was lava flowing in it, emitting blazing ripples from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a Scarlet Dragon Vine that lives in the lava. The lava fluid of it possesses the usage of refining the Spirit. If it is refined, it could enhance the Spirit, allowing one to have more success when undergoing the Spirit Disaster,” said Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mine is a Iceberg Snow Spiritual Fruit. Mine is in contrast to Luo Li’s Scarlet Dragon Vine. However, it also possesses quite a bit of benefit for the Spirit. It is definitely a good item for Spirit Disaster.” Within Wen Qingxuan’s jade-like hands, there was a fruit that was as white as a jade. It seemed to be wrapped by ice and snow as if there was a chill flowing inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen praised. It was definitely beneficial for them to obtain powerful Spiritual Treasures that enhanced the Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan had returned, Pin’er, Xu Huang and the rest had also past through their challenges. Looking at the joy in their eyes, clearly they had a decent harvest, which made Mu Chen smile. It seems like they have struck gold in their visit to the Spiritual Treasure Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhhuuuuu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intense battle of the Spiritual Treasure Mountain had come to an end. Wang Zhong and his group had also returned. Traces of battle could be seen from his body. Clearly, he had undergone an intense battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Wang Zhong came out, he gave Mu Chen a dark glance. There was caution in his eyes and shortly after, he waved his hand and left at a rapid speed, along with the two groups of the Saint Spiritual Academy. They also had quite a bit of harvest. Adding on to his weakened situation after his battle, Wang Zhong was not worried that Mu Chen would attack them. After all, there was only one chance in entering the Spiritual Treasure Mountain. Which also meant that if they did not rob the treasures that the other teams had obtained, one team could only obtain five.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen glanced at their leaving back figures and faintly smiled. He did not obstruct Wang Zhong as the latter had expected. Many people had complicated gazes about the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi that he had previously obtained. Therefore, many people were hiddenly coveting after it. Although their formation was so strong that those fellows would not easily attack them, the instant his flaws were captured by them, perhaps they would cause a decent amount of trouble for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, this was not a time to act. After obtaining the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi, Mu Chen was not too concerned about the other treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Wang Zhong, Wu Yingying and her team returned. She glanced at Mu Chen as she softly snorted. Thereafter, she rapidly left with the members of the Martial Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at her leaving figure, Mu Chen helplessly shook his head. He did not have any malice with Wu Yingying. But it seemed that the girl had rather ill-feeling towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? You don’t bear to part with her?” Wen Qingxuan chuckled as she continued, “Do you know who Wu Yingying’s older brother is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Her older brother?” Mu Chen was stunned and shortly after, a person’s name came out from his mouth, “Wu Ling?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen wasn’t a stranger to Wu Ling. He had fought with him in the Spiritual Road. Therefore, he was well-aware that Wu Ling was very powerful. Speaking from a certain angle, Wu Ling wasn’t inferior to Ji Xuan. Such an opponent was someone that even Mu Chen did not wish to provoke. Thus, even if Mu Chen had fought with Wu Ling in the Spiritual Road, it was just a small scuffle compared to Ji Xuan. So there wasn’t any huge grudges between them.</span></p>
