It was like a colossal mountain that was descending from the sky, enveloping Mu Chen. Such an attack was sufficient to scare the soul out of any Fifth Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Wu’s killing intent for Mu Chen had clearly reached an extremely strong degree.</span></p>

Yet, his eyes glowed with a dense ferocious light. Although Mu Chen was startled by Lu Wu’s move, he wasn’t afraid. That’s because, at this moment, his strength had reached a terrifying height from the Nine Nether Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Borrowing that power, the Sixth Grade Sovereigns that he could not contend with weren’t much in his eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a few breaths’ time, Mu Chen’s skin had been covered by the runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

The roar was filled with boundless fighting intent. As the Battle Will surged, it had taken the form of a wave that swept out in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze boiled and there seemed to be countless ferocious beasts roaring from his body, along with some destructive powers. That energy had surpassed his own, it was the Battle Will of the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ordinary Commanders could only wield Battle Will like a Divine Artifact, it could not be channelled into their bodies. That’s because Battle Will was extremely violent, to begin with, and it was a fusion of the will of innumerable warriors. If it was carelessly absorbed into one’s body and they lost control, it would instantly result in the destruction of the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after refining the Spirit of Battle Will could one gain an in-depth control over it. Thus, one would be able to channel Battle Will into their body, turning it to their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Mu Chen clearly could not achieve this step. So when he channelled the Battle Will into his body, the innards of his body was undulating from it. If it wasn’t for the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, which granted him a powerful physical body, just the Battle Will alone would give him a miserable time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not so easy for you think to that you can kill me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen unleashed a deep roar and threw a palm out as well. There weren’t any fancy tricks behind that palm, but he had made full use of his own power and the surging Battle Will. The power of that palm had even directly shattered space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lu Wu saw Mu Chen’s actions, the expression on his face changed. Thereafter, his face suddenly turned stiff and he realised that Mu Chen wasn’t directing his attack to obstruct Lu Wu’s, but had directly aimed at Lu Wu’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sudden event made Lu Wu’s eyelids frantically twitch. He never expected that after facing his attack, Mu Chen would actually not take any defensive measures and was even more ferocious than him. He’s going to gamble a life for a life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lu Wu was also a ferocious person. Facing Mu Chen and Nine Nether’s attacks, he knew that he could not fully escape from them. Thus, a ferocious light flickered in his eyes and he also did not have any hesitation. His palm had torn through the sky, then swiftly slammed against Mu Chen’s chest like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, when the palm fell against Mu Chen’s body, his body glowed with a golden light. The Dragon-Phoenix Golden Armour, which looked to have been made of gold, appeared. At the same time, the Spirit of the True Dragon swam around on his chest, unleashing a roar as some golden dragon scales covered Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these defensive measures were executed in an instant. At the same time, Mu Chen’s palm, which contained the violent Battle Will, had landed on Lu Wu’s chest as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The violent Spiritual Energy swept out like waves, causing space to crack around the palm. Mu Chen’s body jolted, before he was sent flying out into the ground, causing the ground within a thousand-foot radius to collapse and huge cracks swiftly spread towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was sent into the ground by a palm, Lu Wu’s chest had collapsed by a huge chunk and he spat mouthfuls of blood that were mixed with his shattered innards and shot out like a cannonball.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you want to exchange a life for another, then leave yours behind!” Nine Nether coldly spoke as a raging figure spewed from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Wu’s body trembled with dense fear climbing into his eyes. That’s because he knew that if he allowed Nine Nether’s Undying Flames to burn, he would definitely fall here today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll go all-out with you guys!”</span></p>

A dreadful undulation of Spiritual Energy was also being emitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Nine Nether’s face changed. She immediately pulled her sword out and retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Wu’s body suddenly exploded and a greyish-black Spiritual Energy formed into a massive smoke cloud in the sky. Despite being so beautiful, it was filled with chilling destructiveness in the hearts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Nine Nether was quick in her reaction, she was still slightly affected, since blood there was dripping from the corner of her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in this region had an ashened, astonished faces. No one expected Lu Wu to actually be forced to self-destruct… he was a genuine Sixth Grade Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few minutes ago, he was still calm in the tensed situation. But a few minutes later, he had self-destructed. The sudden change of events made everyone dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether stopped at the far away sky and looked at the violent Spiritual Energy storm. Her eyes suddenly narrowed as she saw a grey light streaking across, swiftly burrowing into the crater that Lu Kui had previously formed, before disappearing at the horizon along with a miserable-looking figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That grey light was naturally Lu Wu’s Spirit. Using the remnant power from his explosion, he had managed to rescue Lu Kui. But as for the remaining Serpent Troop, he could not do anything and merely fled with Lu Kui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the remaining Serpent Troop below saw Lu Wu abandoning them, their morale dropped and they started to flee towards every direction. They no longer had the stance they possessed when they formed the Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If those warriors could form into a troop, they could undoubtedly unleash powerful force. But now that they had lost the will to battle, they were instantly beaten back to their true shape. In the Fallen Battlefield, which was filled with dangers all around, their fates could practically be determined. Therefore, Nine Nether had only briefly cast a glance at their escaping silhouettes, but did not spend any further effort to obstruct them.</span></p>

After all, the strength behind Lu Wu’s move earlier was enough to instantly slaughter any Fifth Grade Sovereign.</span></p>

His clothes had been completely destroyed, with traces of blood hanging on the corner of his lips. His entire body was covered in blood and a sinister wound was stretching from his chest, which was a ghastly sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss!</span></p>

Her brows uncontrollably twitched.</span></p>

He tore off the remaining clothes on his upper body and a golden light could be vaguely seen in his wounds. As the golden light flickered, his wounds were actually healing at a visible speed.</span></p>

Initially, they all held the thoughts of watching the tigers fight while they reap the rewards when both sides were exhausted. But, right now, Mu Chen and Nine Nether seemed to still possess the capability to fight. Especially the Nine Nether Troop beneath them, who had an astonishing morale.</span></p>

Although those people were inferior to the Dragon Serpent Sect, it would still be a little troublesome if they fought. Since they had willingly left this place, that was for the best.</span></p>
