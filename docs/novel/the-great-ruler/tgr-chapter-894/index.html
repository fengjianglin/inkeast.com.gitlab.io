 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard Zhantai Liuli’s words, he couldn’t help smiling. He had naturally noticed the previous hint from the latter and Mu Chen wasn’t disgusted by the fact that Zhantai Liuli had used it to make the Lords feel gratitude towards her. On the contrary, he felt admiration for her. The latter’s eyesight and grasp of the situation were worth praising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s naturally best if someone like her could be avoided as an enemy.</span></p>

Otherwise, it would cause the Lords to suspect Zhantai Liuli.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not impossible, if you want to pay the ransom for these troops to be returned, but that’ll depend on the sincerity of your Divine Pavilion.” Mu Chen said with a smile. His eyes squinted, showing a look that everyone was well to discuss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Kings had also broken free from the battlefield and had flown to Mu Chen’s side. They looked at Mu Chen, who was holding onto the few troops, and their faces couldn’t help turning abnormal. Even for them, it’s not often to see someone take troops as hostages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you mean?” Zhantai Liuli furrowed her brows as she coldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“50,000 Fallen Origin Pellets for a troop. Since there are three troops in my hands, then you have to pay 150,000 Fallen Origin Pellets for me to release them.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen spoke, his words had instantly caused innumerable experts to be dumbfounded. The experts of the Divine Pavilion all gritted their teeth. Clearly, they were pretty heavily angered by Mu Chen’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From afar, when Liu Yan and the party of the Sky Profound Palace saw how Mu Chen was extorting the Divine Pavilion, they felt a little happy in their hearts. When someone was unfortunate and could meet another unfortunate person, this would probably be how they would feel in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen, you’re simply dreaming. Aren’t you afraid of bursting to death with 150,000 Fallen Origin Pellets?!” Fang Yi couldn’t hold back from bellowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The countenances of the Skycroc Lord and the rest turned dark, while ferociously looking at Mu Chen with rage in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you put it that way, I suppose our negotiations have fallen through, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze instantly turned cold and he abruptly clenched his teeth. The barrier that enveloped the three troops of the Divine Pavilion suddenly compressed, like a mountain crashing down, suppressing the three troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Mu Chen’s suppression, despite the three troops trying to resist, no one could truly command Battle Will. So they couldn’t exhibit any great power. Thus, they could only watch as the barrier descended bit by bit and the great pressure had gradually caused their faces to turn pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the Skycroc Lord and the rest drastically changed and creaking noises were coming from them gritting their teeth. Those three troops were nurtured with countless resources from them. If the troops were annihilated, then they would practically lose their power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli coldly barked out. She halted Mu Chen’s actions and looked at the Lords. “The three of you, I believe you guys have come to a decision as well. If you guys want to go all-out, I will assist you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The countenances of the Skycroc Lord and the rest inconsistently changed. Their troops had fallen into Mu Chen’s hands, he only needed a single thought and the ocean of Battle Will would crash down. At that time, their three troops would probably suffer terrible casualties and it would be too late for them to rescue their troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t we exchange with Fallen Origin Pellets first? We can still search for Fallen Origin Pellets, but if we lose our troops, all our efforts after all these years would be for nought.” The Fire Wolf Lord clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skycroc Lord and Sky Bear Lord clenched their fists, which produced crackling noises. But in the end, they could only let out a sigh. Even someone as ruthless and ferocious as them wasn’t willing to have their elite troops buried here. After all, their troops had cost them too many resources and energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No way!” Fang Yi roared. “Even if we add up all the Fallen Origin Pellets we have, we only have 70,000. If we hand all of them over, wouldn’t we have worked for nought? How are we going to explain that to the Palace Master?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it wasn’t for your foolish actions, would our troops have been under Mu Chen’s control? If there’s a need for explanations, then that’s yours to handle. It’s not our business!” The Skycroc Lord darkly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Fang Yi’s face was a little unsightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli cast a glance at them, before looking at Mu Chen and solemnly said, “Mu Chen, it’s impossible for us to have 150,000 Fallen Origin Pellets. Three troops, 20,000 Fallen Origin Pellets each. If you think that it’ll do, then release the troops. Otherwise, let us fight and see if your Great Havenlaw Domain can deal with all of us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“60,000 Fallen Origin Pellets?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly smiled, then straightforwardly nodded his head. “Miss Zhantai knows the current situation. So be it, 60,000 Fallen Origin Pellets. Treat it as me making friends with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew how terrifying his earlier demand was. Therefore, he did not hope for the Divine Pavilion to fork out that amount. But since he could obtain 60,000 Fallen Origin Pellets right now, he was already pretty satisfied. The price offered by Zhantai Liuli was still in his range of acceptance. Furthermore, he needed to give Zhantai Liuli face so that the Lords would feel more gratitude for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli was extremely intelligent and naturally understood Mu Chen’s intentions. Thus, she winked towards Mu Chen before coldly sneering, “I’m not worthy of being friends with someone so greedy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli’s tone was filled with rage and mockery. Her acting skills had left Mu Chen speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli turned to look at the Lords. The three of them wore pained expressions, but they clenched their teeth and waved their sleeves. Three jade bottles flew out, emanating abnormal undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the Fallen Origin Pellets that they had harvested were kept within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli took ahold of the three bottles, then threw them over to Mu Chen. The latter had made a grasping gesture and the jade bottles appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He briefly glanced at the three bottles, before passing them over to Nine Nether to verify. After getting confirmation, he cupped his hands and smiled. “Thanks for your gifts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhantai Liuli wore a cold expression while the Lords all had ferocious expressions. They looked like they wanted to tear Mu Chen to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you release them now?” Zhantai Liuli’s tone was cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head with an eye-narrowing smile and then waved his sleeve. The barrier that trapped the three troops of the Divine Pavilion dispersed. Without the obstruction, the three troops all fled and could no longer maintain their formations. They were like refugees, looking extremely pathetic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the three troops were treasures in the eyes of the Lords, they weren’t of much threat in Mu Chen’s eyes. After all, those troops weren’t controlled by the Battle Will genius, Zhantai Liuli. So there was nothing fearful about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And since he had already formed a hidden alliance with Zhantai Liuli, he naturally wouldn’t worry about those troops being harmful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three troops pathetically fled back to the Divine Pavilion’s party, the warriors had suffered a great blow to their morale because of this incident. Their surging Battle Wills were extremely thin, causing the eyelids of the Lords to twitch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen released the three troops, he cast his glance towards Liu Yan’s party, which was afar. Seeing his gaze, Liu Yan’s face instantly turned unsightly. But after seeing how miserable the Divine Pavilion was, he was naturally also worried that Mu Chen would use the same tactics that he used to deal with them. After all, not only was an elite troop of the Sky Profound Palace in Mu Chen’s hand, there was also a Battle Will genius.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Liu Yan heard that Mu Chen was actually not intending to extort them, he was briefly stunned before feeling relieved. He briefly pondered on that question, before nodding his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After witnessing the miserable situation that the Divine Pavilion was in, Liu Yan suddenly felt that Mu Chen was going easier on them…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, that wasn’t because Mu Chen was going easy on the Sky Profound Palace. He just didn’t want to force Liu Yan. After all, even a rabbit would bite after being pushed into a corner. If it really came to that, Liu Yan might even be willing to sacrifice Xiao Tian and the Sky Profound Division to join forces with the Divine Pavilion. At that time, even they would have to pay a heavy price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Mu Chen brought ruthlessness to the Divine Pavilion on purpose, yet going easy on the Sky Profound Palace. This way, Liu Yan wouldn’t think about risking everything. At the same time, when Divine Pavilion saw that Sky Profound Palace made no loss, they involuntarily felt uneasy in their hearts. Thus, the thoughts of them cooperating had dulled down and Mu Chen could greatly prevent the two factions from joining hands.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s move was simply too beautiful.</span></p>

Since that’s the case, then my Great Havenlaw Domain will take our leave.” Mu Chen laughed as he waved his hand towards the Kings and flew out first, exiting the Death Ruin.</span></p>

Who would have thought that the Great Havenlaw Domain, which was in a perilous situation just a moment ago, would be immediately flipped around with the appearance of Mu Chen…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some experts couldn’t help inwardly sighing and their eyes were filled with lamentation. They had a premonition that perhaps in this Hunting War, that young man that had nothing remarkable about him would turn into a dark horse in such a dumbfound manner…&nbsp;</span></p>
