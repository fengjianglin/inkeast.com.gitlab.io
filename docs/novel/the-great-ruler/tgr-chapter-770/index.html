 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the moonlight, Mu Chen looked at the girl who was using her black obsidian-like pupils, gleaming with the reflection of the light, that seemed like they could speak for themselves. His face couldn’t help being a little stiff, since he had clearly never thought that he would attract fire onto himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the girl before him looked gorgeous and others would yearn to travel together with her, Mu Chen could sense the mystery of these two before him. Therefore, he had no further intentions of interacting too deeply with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before Mu Chen could even speak for himself, Gu Lin, who was beside the girl, immediately objected, “No!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If his father and mother came to know that he actually allowed Cai Xiao to participate at the so-called “Dragon-Phoenix Haven” alone by herself and with an unknown male, they would probably skin him alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Gu Lin’s objection, Mu Chen, however, felt relieved. He nodded his head and honestly said, “I’m sorry, but we are not familiar with one another. Not only will you guys not be rest assured about me bringing her along, but I, myself, also will not, as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Gu Lin gave Mu Chen an ‘at least you’re tactful’ look, which had turned into a blind eye by Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao bent her legs together and rested her chin on her knees as she swept a glance at Gu Lin and Mu Chen. “Objection invalid. I have already made my decision. Even if you do not bring me along, I will look for someone else to do so. Since there are so many people going to the Dragon-Phoenix Haven right now, I don’t have to worry about not finding another person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, however, shrugged his shoulders with indifference. As long as she did not go together with him, she could look for whoever she wanted. But Gu Lin, who was next to them, however, had his face instantly turn green as he made a long face. “Big Sister, you will cause someone to die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was extremely miserable, which made Mu Chen grin. Although that fellow’s strength was terrifying, he seemed to be firmly subdued by this girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao laughed, “There are two choices right now. Either he brings me along, or I will look for someone else myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lin’s delicate and pretty face twitched because he was well-aware of the personality of this big sister of his. Since she had already decided on something, it wouldn’t work, even if he tried to persuade till his lips broke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will leave first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing trouble, Mu Chen immediately gave a dry smile and was about to leave. But before he could even move, a hand fell onto his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen turned his head. Looking at Gu Lin, whose eyes were nearly watering right now, as he clenched his teeth. “Brother, can you look at the sake that I have gifted you guys 5 drops of Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences, can you stop ripping me off anymore?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words had no bit of hypocriticism in them. The girl before him had a beauty on the same level as Luo Li, just that each had their own merits. One was cool and the other was alluring. Generally speaking, these kinds of girls were a danger themselves. Bringing them along might even cause trouble to come knocking by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although both of the choices are bad, you’re the better one.” Gu Lin patted Mu Chen’s shoulder with a pained expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen couldn’t help rolling his eyes. “You are really rest assured?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leaving such a beautiful girl to a stranger that they had just met. Mu Chen had no idea what was going inside the head of this fellow. Furthermore, judging from Cai Xiao’s Spiritual Energy fluctuations, she wasn’t as strong as Gu Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, the one that can take advantage of my big sister has not yet been born in this world.” Gu Lin smiled as he mysteriously said, “If you belittle her, I’m afraid that you will suffer greatly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned and couldn’t help taking another glance at Cai Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, help me out this once. Although we have not known each other for a long time, I believe you are more trustworthy than others.” Gu Lin smiled as he continued, “Someone that was ripped off of 5 drops of Primordial Fire Dragon’s Blood Essences by us and yet, still had the mood to chat and eat with us. A person with such bearings is not ordinary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But, of course, the main thing is…” Gu Lin pointed at Cai Xiao as he continued, “My big sister has good senses. Since she is not rejecting you, then there’s no problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s mouth twitched. Clearly, he could not agree to the last reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can I refuse?” Mu Chen rubbed his brows as he helplessly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao chuckled, “Since that’s the case, then we can only trap you here till the Dragon-Phoenix Haven ends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Agreed.” Mu Chen nodded his head. His voice was straightforward, a wise man knew better than to fight when the odds were against him. He did not doubt the words of this girl before him. Furthermore, the two of them could indeed accomplish this with their strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Smart.” Cai Xiao lightly smiled. Her every frown and smile were emitting an alluring bearing that made the eyes of others slightly dazed. Fortunately, Mu Chen had a pretty decent composure, so he did not lose his bearings before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, there isn’t any harm in travelling with me. Although due to the reason of my physique and my strength are restricted as a result, I will not be a burden to you. Furthermore, you said that every single one of the participants in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven are geniuses amongst geniuses in the Northern Region with extraordinary strengths. Who knows, I might even be of help to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, her hand gently patted as a smear of sly light flashed in her eyes. “Adding all the aforementioned, it will only benefit you to bring me along. So you have no reason to refuse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was left speechless as Gu Lin patted Mu Chen’s shoulder from the side with sympathy. “Look, I’ve said that you will not be able to win against my big sister. Just acknowledge your fate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen rolled his eyes at him. Since he knew that the situation could no longer change, he also couldn’t be bothered to dwindle on this as he asked, “When shall we leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll rest for a night and leave tomorrow.” Gu Lin immediately said. He was clearly afraid that Cai Xiao would directly leave with Mu Chen today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Cai Xiao had nodded her head in agreement, before she lightly leapt up a tree and covered her figure in the dense leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing her actions, Gu Lin turned his gaze over to Mu Chen and cupped his fists. “Brother Mu Chen, I really have to trouble you this time. I will remember this favour. If there’s anything you need of me in the future, you can freely request it of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen shrugged his shoulders. “One should know how to be flexible in situations, if I were to keep rejecting her, then I would be untactful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, if it was other experts like Gu Lin, they wouldn’t be afraid of Mu Chen’s choice. Because their strengths were a fact and Mu Chen was in no position to decline. Furthermore, Gu Lin and Cai Xiao did not take advantage of their position to bully him, so it had made Mu Chen feel a little better in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, we will not do anything to you even if you do not agree to it. Otherwise, if my mother knew about this, I would not have a good time.” Gu Lin smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen laughed as the favourable opinion he had increased. The two of them sat at the bonfire as they talked, while Cai Xiao was lightly leaning on the tree. Hearing the laughter from below, she slowly closed her alluring pupils as her lips rose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ho… Mu Chen…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next day, early morning</span></p>

Judging from his bearings when he speaks, the background of this pair of siblings was clearly out of the ordinary.</span></p>

Although the Blood Essences of a True Dragon were rare, it’s not like his big sister was someone that hadn’t seen treasures before, so she shouldn’t be too stirred by the True Dragon’s Blood Essence. But why would she suddenly decide to go to the Dragon-Phoenix Haven?</span></p>
