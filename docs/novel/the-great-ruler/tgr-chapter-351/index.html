 <p><strong>Chapter 351 - Guidance</strong></p>
 <p>Within the quiet and elegant bamboo house, Mu Chen looked with some awkwardness at the girl dressed in white that was in a seiza position behind the tea table. The latter wore a white dress, with her black hair draped over her shoulders. Coupled with her beautiful face and the lovably pointed jaw, she radiated with a faint icy and indifferent aura, letting people know that it was not easy to get close to her.</p>
 <p>The girl in front of him was really quite beautiful, with not a bit inferior to Su Xuan. The only gripe was that icy indifference, which was the greatest among all of the beautiful girls that Mu Chen had ever seen.</p>
 <p>He never imagined that this eccentric Elder Ling Xi would actually be this young and beautiful.</p>
 <p>Su’er, who had also adopted the seiza position beside Ling Xi, secretly laughed as she looked at Mu Chen’s awkward-looking face.</p>
 <p>Regardless of that, the girl in white did not care about the Mu Chen in front of her and was minding her own business as she extended her slender white hand. Picking up the teapot, she gently poured the tea out, bringing along a clear and melodious sound within the quiet room as the tea entered the cup.</p>
 <p>Giving a dry cough, Mu Chen cupped his hands and said, “This student, Mu Chen, has seen Elder Ling Xi. I apologize for my earlier conduct…”</p>
 <p>“Why did you come here?” asked the white girl in a calm voice, with no presence of any fluctuations.</p>
 <p>“The Dean has asked me to come here to find Elder…Ling Xi for guidance on cultivation in Spiritual Arrays,” replied Mu Chen, with the word ‘Elder’ being said with slight difficulty, as he had never seen such a young and beautiful Elder.</p>
 <p>“I don’t teach people.” Holding the jade tea cup in her white hands, the girl in white took a light sip before giving her reply.</p>
 <p>Hearing her reply, Mu Chen immediately glared at Su’er sitting beside her.</p>
 <p>“I don’t teach males.” Seemingly knowing what Mu Chen was referring to, the girl in white added a casual response.</p>
 <p>Feeling helpless, the only thing Mu Chen could do was forsake his shame and replied, “It’s the Dean who asked me to come here.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the beautiful eyes of the girl in white rotated up slightly. Shooting a look at Mu Chen, she replied, “I’m not a person of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. The only reason I’m here is due to owing a favor to Dean Tai Cang. Therefore, I’ve only agreed to help him construct some Spiritual Arrays for the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. As long as I want to, I can leave at any time. Therefore, don’t use his name and try to pressure me.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen was immediately speechless. This Elder Ling Xi’s character truly was eccentric. She didn’t even give face to Dean Tai Cang. This turn of events truly made Mu Chen feel slightly at a loss on how to proceed.</p>
 <p>The girl in white proceeded to ignore the helplessly feeling Mu Chen and started to play with her elaborately designed jade cup with her usual indifferent expression.</p>
 <p>Do to this, the atmosphere within the room quickly became silent and slightly stifling.</p>
 <p>Seeing Mu Chen starting to shrivel up, Su’er could not help, laughing up her sleeve, before saying quietly, “Elder Sister Ling Xi, Big Brother Mu Chen’s talent in Spiritual Arrays is very good, and is even better than me.”</p>
 <p>“There are too many people with good talent. If I were to teach every single one I see, wouldn’t that tire me to death?” asked Ling Xi as she glared at Su’er.</p>
 <p>“Elder Sister Ling Xi, can you please help Big Brother Mu Chen, please? He treats me very well,” begged Su’er as she started to act like a spoilt kid.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, Ling XI did not budge.</p>
 <p>“Elder Sister Ling Xi, if you don’t agree, I’ll not do work anymore,” said Su’er as she pouted her small mouth.</p>
 <p>“Then, I’ll just have to lock you up in the Spiritual Array House.” replied Ling Xi in a soft voice as a smile seemed to rise from the corner of her mouth.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the three words “Spiritual Array House”, Su’er immediately turned quiet in fear, her little face quickly showed a bitter expression as she did not dare to continue speaking.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Su’er did not dare to continue speaking, Ling Xi turned quietly for a slight moment before looking at Mu Chen. With an indifferent tone, she asked, “So, you’re a Rank 4 Spiritual Array Master now?”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” replied Mu Chen while nodding his head.</p>
 <p>“What problem do you have?” asked Ling Xi.</p>
 <p>“I would like to know how to control the Heart’s Eye state.” Mu Chen immediately replied. To him, the Heart’s Eye state was extremely important. Once he was truly able to able to control the Heart’s Eye state, he would be able to rely on his strength of a Rank 4 Spiritual Array Master to arrange Rank 5 Spiritual Arrays.</p>
 <p>Although it could be said that he had managed to faintly make contact with the Heart’s Eye state, the entirety of this state was extremely complicated. If he only relied on his probing and feelings, he truly did not know when he would achieve the level of full control.</p>
 <p>“Heart’s Eye?” muttered Ling Xi, as a trace of astonishment revealed itself within her eyes. She truly didn’t imagine that Mu Chen was actually able to make contact with the Heart’s Eye state at his current level. It looked like what Su’er said was true, that he possessed an extremely high talent for Spiritual Arrays.</p>
 <p>“The Heart’s Eye state is a rather high and deep state within the path of a Spiritual Array Master. It’s known in two forms, the Void Heart’s Eye state, and the Real Heart’s Eye state. However, from the looks of it, you aren’t even at the level of full control over the Void Heart’s Eye state.”</p>
 <p>Hearing her explanation, Mu Chen faintly gawked. Obviously, he never thought that the Heart’s Eye state would actually have such a differentiation within it.</p>
 <p>“What’s the difference between the two?”</p>
 <p>“The Void Heart’s Eye state is an illusionary feeling and comprehension. If a Spiritual Array was arranged by two Spiritual Array Masters, one with control over the Void Heart’s Eye state, while the other doesn’t, not only will the amount of Spiritual Energy consumed by the one with control be less, its might would be even stronger, with even the chances of failure being drastically lowered. An extremely significant reason why some outstanding Spiritual Array Masters were able to arrange boundary-breaking Spiritual Arrays is due to their control over this state.”</p>
 <p>“As for the Real Heart’s Eye state…” Ling Xi’s voice paused slightly at this moment, before continuing, “Spiritual Array Masters that have such a degree of control over the Heart’s Eye state would feel a good deal of Spiritual Arrays become incomparably simple in their eyes. This is due to them already being able to see through a lot of their complicated structures and peer into their cores. If you were to meet an enemy of such caliber, they would be able to see the weakest point of the Spiritual Arrays that you’ve arranged with a single look, and break them easily…”</p>
 <p>“In addition, once one trains their control over the Real Heart’s Eye state to an extremely deep and high level, it would no longer continue to be an illusionary feeling. It would turn substantial, akin to an existence of a genuine eye. That’s the true Heart’s Eye state.”</p>
 <p>“Under the gaze of the Heart’s Eye state, no Spiritual Arrays would exist. If you come face-to-face with such a Spiritual Array Master, it’s best that you don’t arrange any Spiritual Arrays in front of that person. That’s because he would be able to see through your constructs in a single look. Perhaps, in an instant, he would be able to arrange a Spiritual Array identical to the one you’ve arranged.”</p>
 <p>Hearing her complete explanation, Mu Chen was completely dumbfounded. Reproducing an opponent’s Spiritual Array with a single look? Wasn’t that too perverted and abnormal? He never imagined that this Heart’s Eye state would actually be that formidable. However, it seemed too far away from him. To him, what he wanted now was not the other benefits that it would provide, but only the little bit of allowing him to arrange boundary-breaking Spiritual Arrays…</p>
 <p>“Exactly when would one be able to control this state?” Mu Chen posed his question cautiously.</p>
 <p>“That’s very simple. You just have to train and practice more,” replied Ling Xi with a downplaying tone.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen instantly felt sweat dripping down from his forehead. Isn’t this making it sound too simple?</p>
 <p>“What should I do?” asked Mu chen helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Do you really want to control it?” asked Ling Xi as her intelligent and bright eyes focused on Mu Chen, while the icy in-differentness within them seemingly weaker than before. However, what replaced them was an indifferent laughing intent, which made Mu Chen feel a little uneasy.</p>
 <p>However, at this time, regardless of his unease, the only thing he could do was steel himself. It was not easy to get this eccentric lady to guide him, If he showed the slightest bit of hesitation, he might be sent flying out once again.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” replied Mu Chen with a nod.</p>
 <p>Hearing his reply, Su’er used a sympathizing gaze as she looked at Mu Chen, she was already able to picture the unlucky look that would soon appear on his face.</p>
 <p>“Follow me,” said Ling Xi and she stood up, revealing her slender and exquisite physique wrapped within the white clothing, Bringing along a slight trace of fragrance, she walked directly out of the house, leaving Mu Chen looking at her graceful and slender back figure.</p>
 <p>The three of them headed out of the bamboo house and entered a bamboo forest, before stopping at a spacious clearing within its depths.</p>
 <p>“In general, although Spiritual Arrays are complicated,to a Spiritual Array Master, the most important part of it would be the Array Core. Once the core is broken, even the most powerful Spiritual Array would dissipate into thin air. However, wanting to identify the Array Core of an incomparably complex Spiritual Array in operation would be an extremely difficult task.”</p>
 <p>Looking towards Mu Chen, Ling Xi extended her slender jade-like finger and gave the space a tap. In the next instant, ripples seemed to undulate out from the touched space, as Mu Chen was able to feel the Spiritual Energy in this stretch of the world seemingly becoming disordered and chaotic.</p>
 <p>Spiritual Energy akin to a storm condensed within the spacious clearing within the bamboo forest, as a scarlet-red glowing array started to form in the air. In the next instant, a strong Spiritual Energy fluctuation started to spread out, while radiating with a scorching-hot aura.</p>
 <p>Looking at the scarlet-red Spiritual Array that had taken shape in an instant around him, Mu Chen’s expression changed uncontrollably. This Spiritual Array should be a Fourth Grade one. If he was the one arranging it, it would require ample preparation before attempting to arrange it. However, with a single tap of her jade-like finger, this Ling Xi was able to form a Fourth Grade Spiritual Array. Furthermore, Mu Chen did not even see her condense a single Spiritual Seal…</p>
 <p>She had directly controlled the Spiritual Energy of the heavens and earth to arrange a Spiritual Array. This way made it even harder for people to guard against it.</p>
 <p>One had to know that when a Spiritual Array Master arranges a Spiritual Array, the first thing that needed to be done was to condense the Spiritual Seals. However, it would give a clear indication to one’s enemy what one’s actions were. However, from what Ling Xi had done, she had directly omitted this step.</p>
 <p>Shock quietly flooded Mu Chen’s heart as he thought, <em>A Great Spiritual Array Master, she truly is worthy of that title. She’s on a completely different level from me. </em></p>
 <p>However, just as Mu Chen was secretly feeling shocked, Ling Xi wasn’t done with what she was doing. With another tap of her jade-like finger, one could see two similarly gigantic and complicated Spiritual Arrays surfacing in the air, enveloping the scarlet-red glowing array within them.</p>
 <p>Three complete Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays. Furthermore, they were arranged simultaneously.</p>
 <p>Unable to bear it any more, the corner of Mu Chen’s mouth started to twitch.</p>
 <p>The three Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays enveloped the entire clearing with Mu Chen at their very most centre location. Currently, he did not even dare to make the slightest movement, since a single movement from him would cause the three Spiritual Arrays to launch erratic attacks at him.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ling Xi…”</p>
 <p>With a dry laugh, Mu Chen asked, “May I know what this is for?”</p>
 <p>“Before being killed by them, you’ll have to find the Array Cores of these three Spiritual Arrays, before breaking them to escape. Remember, you’re not allowed to use your Spiritual Energy to forcefully break them. You’re only allowed to break the Array Cores,” replied Ling Xi in an indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen immediately opened his mouth wide. <em>What the hell is this hellish form of training? Immediately asking me to deal with three Rank 4 Spiritual Arrays, can’t we stick to the norm? This truly can kill me!</em></p>
 <p>“I’ll give you an hour. If you can’t break them, there’s no need for you to continue staying here, and just return to where you’ve come from. I won’t teach such stupid people.” Nevertheless, Ling Xi completely ignored the feelings of Mu Chen. After speaking her words in an indifferent tone, with a wave of her sleeve, she turned around and left.</p>
 <p>“Su’er, make sure to watch him. If he dares to forcefully break the arrays, you’ll be the next one that enters.”</p>
 <p>As Ling Xi’s beautiful figure headed into the distance, her clear and cold voice fluttered over, causing Su’er’s little face to turn bitter. In the next moment, she looked towards Mu Chen, currently in the middle of the arrays with an extremely pitiful expression.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Mu Chen, you have to listen to Elder Sister Ling Xi’s words… Su’er doesn’t want to go in there…”</p>
