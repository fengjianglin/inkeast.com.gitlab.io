 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jaws of quite a few people started to turn slightly agape, their gazes turning blank as they looked towards the thin figure before them. For a moment, they seem to have a feeling as if they had mistakenly heard him say those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did Mu Chen want to take on three people by himself, he had even wanted to use just one move to deal with them?</span></p>

If not for the abnormal situation before them, they might have already started uncontrollably laughing and sneering, as Mu Chen’s words were truly too rampant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three people before him were absolutely not just some ordinary people. They were powerful figures that were now ranked among the Top 16 in the point rankings. Although their places were at the bottom of the rankings, the might of their strength would cause extreme dread and fear even in experts of First Grade Spirit Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Mo Xiu and the other two might not have passed through the second level of their Spirit Disaster, they had absolutely started making contact with it already. Compared to them, experts at First Grade Spirit Disaster still had some disparity in strength and power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing Mu Chen’s ability when he broke Xiao Huang’s Heaven Binding Spiritual Array, there was already no one that dared to underestimate him again. However, despite that, there was no one that would be able to contend against three experts placed on the point rankings with their individual might, no matter how optimistic the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Mu Chen’s words, Wu Yingying had tightly knitted her eyebrows. Staring at Mu Chen’s figure, she said, “Exactly what is he up to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because he wants to show his superiority to Ji Xuan by making a stand now,” replied Wu Ling with a smile. “Ji Xuan had sent people over to feel him out. Therefore, he wants to turn Ji Xuan’s probe into a palm and send a heavy slap back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A while ago, Ji Xuan had defeated three experts on the point rankings by himself, sending them tumbling down from the Top 16. From then on, his name shook the entire Great Spiritual Academy Tournament. What Mu Chen wants to do now is precisely the same. Furthermore… he wants to be even more vicious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A one move deal? Won’t this be… too risky?” Wu Yingying retracted the word “rampant” before she could speak it. Having some understanding of Mu Chen, as well as his character, she knew that it was impossible for him to get hot-headed and lose all rationale in his thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can be considered to have some understanding… This fellow never speaks without thinking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bright light slightly condensed within the eyes of Wu Ling. Staring at the figure before his eyes, he said with a faint smile, “Therefore, he should have a certain level of assurance. Haha. I’m indeed extremely curious to see exactly how he’s going to accomplish this with his strength at merely Spiritual Energy Disaster. Could he be relying on Spiritual Arrays? If he plans to do so, he would have to arrange an array comparable to the Rank 5 Combination Diagram, the Heaven Binding Spiritual Array, to be able to deal with three experts at First Grade Spirit Disaster, right? Would Mo Xiu and the other two give him such time to do so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing her brother’s words, Wu Yingying wrinkled her eyebrows once more, while a slightly ugly feeling appeared within her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the sounds of whispers blotted the skies and shook the earth, Mo Xiu and the other two had similar blank expressions displayed on their faces. Exchanging glances with one another, preposterous and incredulous feelings started to uncontrollably erupt within their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person whose strength appeared to be merely at the realm of Spiritual Energy Disaster had actually said that he wanted to deal with the three of them by himself. Furthermore, from the looks of it, it seemed as if he wanted to deal with them using a single move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they knew that Mu Chen’s strength should be higher than what his outward appearance was showing… wanting to deal with the three of them using a single move… This caused them to feel so much anger and fury to the point of them involuntary laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Does this Mu Chen truly think that he is Ji Xuan?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truly impressive, Captain Mu Chen.” Mo Xiu could not help giving a sneer. Staring right at Mu Chen, he continued speaking, “From the looks of it, you’ve also heard about what Ji Xuan had done a while back. However, if you truly want to use a similar method to prove that you possess the qualifications to contend with him, I’m afraid that you’ve found the wrong people to do so.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, a smile surfaced on the calm, handsome face of Mu Chen while he replied, “From what time did Ji Xuan think he’s above me? The lessons he received from me in the past should be plentiful enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those battles during the Spiritual Road are just experiences and tempering. If you’ve always treated those as your source of confidence, you’ll become extremely disappointed at yourself,” said Mo Xiu with a sneer still present on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Mu Chen nodded his head in agreement, before replying with a faint smile, “I’ll have you guys bring that statement to Ji Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xiu’s face instantly twitched slightly when Mu Chen gave his reply, before his gaze turned slightly dark. Exchanging glances with the other two Captains beside him, they proceeded to take a step forward. Instantly, three tyrannical Spiritual Energy fluctuations swept out from their bodies like a hurricane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As their Spiritual Energies swept out, spiritual light flashed, as the suppression brought about by the three tyrannical Spiritual Energies rapidly radiated, causing the faces of quite a few groups to turn solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those Captains of powerful groups who had reached the first level of their Spirit Disaster had their eyes brimming with fear and dread. Indeed, none of the people in the Top 16 were one bit mediocre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Mu Chen, the faces of Xu Huang and the others were filled with solemness. They had similarly not expected that Mu Chen had planned to contend against those three powerful people by himself. Although they were somewhat worried for the former, since matters had already progressed to this stage, the only thing they could do was to sit quietly and wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shooting a look at Mu Chen’s back, Luo Li didn’t speak due to her confidence and trust in the former. She similarly knew that Mu Chen would not speak without making any thoughts beforehand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Can you do it?” Wen Qingxuan could not help shoot a question. Although she had already seen the might of the Combination Array Mu Chen had arranged while in the remnant of the Divine Wood Palace, from the looks of the current situation, the opposite party would clearly not give him the time to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t I tell you that you can’t just shoot such a question out at any random time?” Slightly panning his head, Mu Chen shot a smile towards Wen Qingxuan as he gave his reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint blush of embarrassment instantly appeared on Wen Qingxuan’s fair and exquisite face, before shooting a fierce glare at Mu Chen.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow actually dares to tease me at such a time!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Relax.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen took a gentle breath as a faint shade of fierceness appeared on his handsome face. “Since there are people that want to test if I would be any of threat to him, I’ll naturally not disappoint him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Wen Qingxuan lightly nodded her head, without saying anymore words. She knew about the grudges and grievances between Mu Chen and Ji Xuan, with seemingly no possibility of reconciliation. If it was in the past, she might have chosen to remain neutral in the face of their confrontation. However, when Mu Chen had rushed across a thousand miles to help her, this had truly made her consider him as a friend. Therefore, among the two, she would naturally be biased towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she knew that Ji Xuan was an extremely thorny person to deal with, this wasn’t something she, Wen Qingxuan, would care about. The arrogant and self-confident her would never assume that she would be weaker than Ji Xuan.</span></p>

As for the few fellows from the Academy Alliance, feel relaxed as none of them will be able to run away,” said Wen Qingxuan, shooting a faint glare towards Xiao Huang, Xiao Wang and the others standing not far away with her beautiful eyes.</span></p>

They were all too clear about the strength of Mo Xiu and the other two. If the two of them were to collaborate, they might have some chance of victory. However, they would absolutely not dare to proclaim their ignorance to be able to defeat the trio with a single move.</span></p>

With Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan present, regardless of how difficult it was to deal with Xiao Huang or Xiao Wang, Mu Chen did not believe that they would be able to do much in the presence of these two girls.</span></p>

As the Spiritual Energies pressed against the surrounding air, low muffled explosion sounds erupted.</span></p>

The three of us are looking forward to face it at anytime! However, I have to add that we know of you being a Spiritual Array Master. If you’re planning on letting us wait stupidly for you to arrange your Spiritual Array, I’m afraid that we’re unable to let you do so.”</span></p>

The degree of Spiritual Energy surging from their bodies was a few degrees stronger than ordinary experts at First Grade Spirit Disaster. Clearly, the trio had already started to touch Second Grade Spirit Disaster. If they were given some more time, there was an extremely high possibility for them to be able to successfully cross this step.</span></p>

As his hands gentled clapped together, they quietly formed a somewhat shaky and exceedingly mysterious hand seal.</span></p>
