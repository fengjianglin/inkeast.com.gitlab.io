 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Splash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen charged into the magma, the high temperature frantically blew over. Right now, he had already pushed his Lightning God’s Physique to the limits. Furthemore, he had also used Spiritual Energy to protect himself. However, he still felt the burning pain on his skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen turned into a streak of light as he tore the magma apart and swiftly flew towards the depths of the magma. Although he knew that it was a dangerous thing to do, how do you catch a tiger cub without going into a tiger cave? In order to break through to Third Grade Sovereign, he had to give it a try, even if it was dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Batches of Spiritual Fire Pythons could be seen swimming in the magma. Mu Chen did not want to get tangled up with them, so he carefully avoided them and headed towards the depths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a few dozen breaths time, Mu Chen had already descended down a thousand miles down the Greatlaw Blaze Pond. The magma here was a faint purple in colour, caused by the terrifying temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Mu Chen was starting to find it hard to endure the high temperature, even with his Lightning God’s Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen lightly inhaled a mouthful of air as his heart lightly shook. He saw a strand of dark purple flame appearing on the surface of his body, turning into a fire membrane that enveloped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying temperature weakened at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark purple flames were the Undying Flames. Although the temperature in the Greatlaw Blaze Pond was high, it could not penetrate through the protection formed by the Undying Flames. Because of the fact that Mu Chen had to train before, he did not activate them. But, right now, since he had to hunt even more powerful Spiritual Fire Pythons, it was very appropriate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the shield of the Undying Flames, Mu Chen’s speed instantly increased. In just a few minutes, he had gone down two thousand feet. The Spiritual Energy contained in the magma was also stunningly violent. Some of the magma was even condensed into cubes of flames that were floating in the magma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the most bizarre fact was the condensed magma was surrounded by an absolute void. Not even a single bit of magma could get into the range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure fell onto a huge magma rock and instantly sensed that the surrounding pressure had instantly dissipated. It felt like the magma rocks could completely negate the pressure and high temperatures in the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A bizarre place indeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stomped his feet, but the magma rock did not make any movements, which made him involuntarily sigh. The Great Thousand World was truly filled with all sorts of bizarre things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why can’t I see a single Spiritual Fire Python?” Mu Chen swept his gaze around and murmured to himself in doubt. He realised that there wasn’t even a single Spiritual Fire Python around, which was completely different to how densely packed it was above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen swept his glance in doubt, a condensed magma rock that wasn’t far away from him exploded. A huge python’s tail instantly tore through the magma, smashing towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden attack caused Mu Chen’s expression to slightly change as he stomped his feet and flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tail abruptly smashed down, shattering the magma rock into fragments. Mu Chen’s figure was also swept up by the shock wave and miserably retreated a few dozen steps back, before stabilising himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He solemnly directed his gaze over and saw a huge Spiritual Fire Python coiled up in the magma. The figure of the python was much larger than any he had seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good fellow, this is at least four hundred years old!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inhaled a mouthful of chilled air. The size of the python was entirely two-to-three times larger in size than the 100-year-old ones. According to his estimation, this one was at least four hundred years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a level of Spiritual Fire Python’s strength was probably not any weaker than Qin Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a genuine big and tough fellow to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss! Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Fire Python was ferociously staring at Mu Chen. There wasn’t any hesitation as it opened its mouth and a beam of scarlet magma shot towards Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power contained in the beam of magma wasn’t something that the other Spiritual Fire Pythons that Mu Chen encountered before could deal with. So he did not dare to be careless. A golden light burst out from his rear and the Great Solar Undying Body was quickly summoned by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden palm and magma beam clashed against one another as a terrifying windstorm swept out, causing multiple floating magma rocks to shatter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure appeared on the head of the Great Solar Undying Body and his gaze was sharp, looking at the raging Spiritual Fire Python. He abruptly formed seals with his hands and a Sovereign Sea appeared behind him, along with the roar and whistle of dragons and elephants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two dragons and elephants flew out at the same time, condensing into a dragon-elephant light halo. Being directed by Mu Chen’s finger, the light halo penetrated through the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had immediately used his strongest card right from the start, the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art. He clearly understood how powerful the Spiritual Fire Python was, so he did not want to attempt any unnecessary probing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss! Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Fire Python faced the sky as it hissed out. The scales on its body stood up when it sensed the fatal danger as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A substantial scarlet light halo endlessly burst out from the body of the Spiritual Fire Python. From the looks of it, it looked like layers of protection that protected the Spiritual Fire Python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just this alone showed that the strength of this Spiritual Fire Python far exceeded those that Mu Chen had encountered before. After all, Mu Chen had not seen his previous opponents execute such a powerful defence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen was also confident in the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art. Back then, Qin Bei lost against this, so he did not think that a Spiritual Fire Python that didn’t possess any intelligence could survive it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dragon-elephant light halo appeared above the Spiritual Fire Python, spinning rapidly, granting it the sharpness to tear apart anything. Combined by the power of the dragons and elephants, it was practically unstoppable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dragon-elephant halo streaked across with a rustle. In only an instant, the layers of defence around the Spiritual Fire Python had been torn apart, which was followed by a sharp shrieking cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Directing his gaze over, he saw the ferocious Spiritual Fire Python being sliced into two. The results made him grin in satisfaction. Under the killing move of the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art, you would be killed, no matter what was it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before Mu Chen could relax, he saw the Spiritual Fire Python that was sliced into two open its ferocious mouth and an extremely violent beam of light shot towards him, enveloping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Solar Undying Body had its arms crossing its head, withstanding the scarlet beam of light with its massive body. However, there were cracks that appeared on its arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s lips twitched, since he did not think that the vitality of the Spiritual Fire Python would be so powerful. It was already sliced in two and yet, it could still put up a struggled to such a degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are definitely mine, Spiritual Fire Python.” Mu Chen sneered. He refuses to believe that this Spiritual Fire Python that was split into two could flip the situation around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was prepared to be ruthless, the Spiritual Fire Python had no intention to pounce forth, but had turned around and was fleeing instead, which left Mu Chen stunned. He clearly didn’t think that this Spiritual Fire Python that had reached the age of 400 years old to not only possess such powerful strength, it even knew how to escape. It was completely different from those Spiritual Fire Pythons that Mu Chen had previously encountered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen willed in his heart and the Great Solar Undying Body pursued it. It took him a great amount of effort to encounter such a precious Spiritual Fire Python, so he naturally wouldn’t let it escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when his figure moved, his hair abruptly stood up as an indescribable sense of danger surged in his heart. It was this feeling that made Mu Chen control the Great Solar Undying Body to stop in its tracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the depths of the magma, there was a scarlet figure that flew out with an indescribable speed, directly coiling around the Spiritual Fire Python and drilled into the head of the python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Fire Python violently struggled as its figure dried up in a few breaths’ time. It was as if it was being sucked dry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was dumbfounded as he watched his scene. Shortly after, he slowly lowered his stiffened head and saw a massive scarlet serpent-scorpion swimming in the depths of the magma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had the head of a scorpion and tail of a python, there was also a scorpion sting that was flickering with a chilled light on its tail, emanating dreadful Spiritual Energy fluctuations from its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fluctuations were so much more powerful than the 400-year-old Spiritual Fire Python from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gulp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swallowed a mouthful of saliva as he felt a chill in his palms. He never thought that such a powerful and mysterious scorpion-serpent would be hidden in the depths of the magma. It’s no wonder why there weren’t any Spiritual Fire Pythons in this region!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emotionless gaze of the scarlet scorpion-serpent turned and stopped on Mu Chen’s figure. It did not possess any intelligence as well, only pure massacre and violence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inhaled a mouthful of air as the Great Solar Undying Body beneath him quickly dissipated and his figure burst out to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scarlet scorpion-serpent possessed strength that wasn’t something that he could confront at this moment. Mu Chen knew that if he did not flee right now, his outcome might be the same as the Spiritual Fire Python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he felt heartache for the 400-year-old Spiritual Fire Python, his life was more important in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen fled for his life. He was intending on escaping upwards, but the floating magma rocks became his biggest obstructions. In the end, he could only give up and run in a straight line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he ran for his life, the corner of Mu Chen’s eyes swept towards his rear. This quick glance instantly made him become drenched in cold sweat. He saw the mysterious scorpion-serpent streaking across the magma, swiftly pursuing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, it did not intend to let go of him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen cursed with his teeth clenched. He never thought that when he was initially hunting Spiritual Fire Pythons, in the end, he would turn into the prey instead…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen pushed his speed to the limits and started to frantically flee. Behind him, the scarlet scorpion-serpent that possessed terrifying strength was closely following him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent spread out in the depths of the magma as the roles between the hunter and hunted had quickly swapped.</span></p>
