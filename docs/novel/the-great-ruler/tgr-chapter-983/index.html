But even if this continent was tattered, it still emitted a unique pressure that caused everyone here to feel revere in their hearts for the ancient times.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those four streaks of light were naturally Mu Chen’s group, who had placed their objective on the Primordial Body Refining Pagoda after arriving in the Divine Beast Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had already travelled for nearly half a day and they had also encountered other Spiritual Beast Clans along the way. But due to them having their guards up and fear for each other, they did not have any disputes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, before seeing any treasures, no one wanted to exhaust their energy in vain. Anyone that could come to the Divine Beast Origin wasn’t ordinary, or they possessed some capabilities. Therefore, they wouldn’t go provoking others without benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely so, so Mu Chen and the rest felt rather free from the troubles in their journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to our direction, we should be a day away from the nearest Primordial Body Refining Pagoda.” As they flew, Nine Nether held a compass made of beast bones with a lustre on it that vaguely formed into a blurry map with a pagoda picture at the centre of the map. That must’ve been their objective for this trip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head, he wasn’t anxious, since he had slightly closed his eyes in their journey. As his thoughts circulated, he had been endlessly absorbing the Spiritual Energy between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as Mu Chen was swiftly absorbing the Spiritual Energy, he could sense the surge of peculiar energy being mixed in it and when it was absorbed into his body, Mu Chen could sense his blood aura seemingly becoming a little more lively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Energy in the Divine Beast Origin actually contained a trace of energy that could refine the physical body. Slightly tracing back the energy, Mu Chen could sense that it was the desolate aura that was spreading out between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s no wonder why the Divine Beast Origin would have such importance and weight in the Divine Beast Continent. Cultivating here is greatly beneficial for Spiritual and Divine Beast Clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen inwardly praised. Although he had been absorbing for half a day, the improvement still wasn’t comparable to a single drop of the Spiritual Blood Paste, but it’s endless in this place and he did not need to bitterly search around as he did for the Spiritual Blood Paste. In the long term, this increment was rather terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like the refining effect of the Divine Beast Origin has for the physical body is truly beneficial…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing the surging blood aura in his body, a smile appeared on Mu Chen’s face and he grew even more expectant towards the Primordial Body Refining Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as he could break through to the second level of the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, he would be able to confront a Seventh Grade Sovereign with just his physical body alone at that time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did he need to help Nine Nether obtain the Primordial Undying Bird’s Bloodline during this trip to the Divine Beast Origin, but he also needed to increase his strength so that he would be qualified to compete for the evolution of the Great Solar Undying Body when the Ancient Haven Palace appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four of them appeared on a lone peak and they looked into the distance, before they saw a huge city that was thousands of miles away standing in the group of mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this city was already in ruins, they could still tell the majesty that it once possessed, despite being in ruins. During ancient times, this city must’ve been a great city in the Divine Beast Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is the Great Desolate City, a top force of the Divine Beast Origin in ancient times. There’s a Primordial Body Refining Pagoda left in this city.” Nine Nether pointed towards the ancient and ruined city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded before looking at this region with his eyes contracted. “Looks like the attraction force of this Primordial Body Refining Pagoda is pretty big…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his perception, he could sense a powerful aura whistling over from the distant horizon and the objective of those people was this Primordial Body Refining Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, aside from the aura of those swiftly rushing over, Mu Chen knitted his brows as he looked at the ruined city. There were quite a few Spiritual Energy undulations and someone must have reached this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen sensed the Spiritual Energy undulations in the city, his expression suddenly changed, before he raised his head and looked in a direction. There were several long streaks in the horizon. Furthermore, those streaks were moving in their direction as though they had sensed their existence. Thus, the breaking sound of wind had immediately resounded in the sky above them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. I was wondering who it was, so it’s Nine Nether… There hasn’t been any news about you for years, I even thought that you’d failed…” When those several silhouettes appeared, a girl’s pampered laughter resounded. Although her voice was beautiful, her words were extremely harsh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nine Nether heard her words, her face instantly turned cold. When she raised her head, a ridiculing smile appeared. “Liu Qing, looks like you still haven’t gotten over your loss to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head as well and saw four silhouettes appearing in the sky before them. Amongst the four silhouettes, there was a green-clothed lady. She had a slender and voluptuous figure with exquisite brows, looking somewhat seductive. It’s just that, at the moment, a cold light had flashed in her eyes from Nine Nether’s rebuttal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen frowned his brows as he looked at this bunch of people. Clearly, he was puzzled about their origins. But judging from the current situation, Nine Nether seemed to have a deep implication with this green-dressed lady called Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Mu Chen, they’re from the Sky Roc Clan. In the past, the Sky Roc Clan would send their younger generations to our Nine Netherbird Clan to spar, and Liu Qing was defeated by Big Sister Nine Nether. I never expected for her to be this narrow-minded, to remember this matter so clearly.” While Mu Chen was puzzled, Mo Ling whispered and her tone did not have much of a favourable impression of Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sky Roc Clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned, before slightly nodded his head. It’s a Spiritual Beast clan that wasn’t at all inferior to the Nine Netherbird Clan. That clan also had some history and they possessed the bloodline of the super Divine Beast, the Gold Winged Roc. Upon awakening that bloodline, they would possess a boundless potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never thought, Nine Nether, that your mouth would get more formidable after so long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mu Chen and Mo Ling spoke, Liu Qing coldly smiled as she looked at Mu Chen and her brows were raised. “I previously heard some news that you have formed a Bloodlink Bond with a human. I believe he must be the one, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She examined Mu Chen with pride in her eyes and a hint of disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sixth Grade Sovereign… you even dare to bring him to the Divine Beast Origin with his strength. Looks like he’s pretty important to you, but you have to be careful. If he dies in the Divine Beast Origin, you might have to be buried with him, Nine Nether.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen heard her words, his brows knitted with a flash of cold light in his eyes. However, he only looked at Liu Qing with indifference. He did not lose his composure after being ridiculed, but an ill will rose in his heart for this girl. If opportunity allowed, he would definitely give her a good lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Qing looked at Mu Chen with indifference and a flash of astonishment in her eyes, which must be from the composure that the latter had shown, which wasn’t something someone of his age should possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to worry about this matter. If you think that the previous lesson I taught you was not enough, I can accompany you to play at anytime.” Nine Nether coldly said.</span></p>

With Big Brother Zong Teng’s speed, it’s hard to find an opponent for him amongst the Seventh Grade Sovereigns.” That expert of the Sky Roc Clan smiled as he looked at Mu Chen’s group with a smile-yet-not-a-smile expression.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ling frowned her brows. Her complexion wasn’t too good. “Zong Teng is the most outstanding youth within the younger generations of the Sky Roc Clan. It’s said that he has awakened the Gold Winged Roc’s bloodline and has an extremely powerful strength. He had once fought with a genius of the Phoenix Clan and wasn’t any inferior to them, his fame is extremely great amongst the younger generations of the Spiritual Beast Realm.”</span></p>

It was no wonder why Liu Qing would show such a fearless appearance, so she was relying on the fact that she had someone backing her up.</span></p>

But she did not say anything else, until she chuckled, “Looks like your objective is also the body refining pagoda. That’s good, at that time… I will get Big Brother Zong Teng to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">take care</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;of you guys.”</span></p>

Shortly afterwards, she clenched her teeth and glared at Mu Chen, then coldly smiled. “I hope that you can still smile when you see Big Brother Zong Teng!”</span></p>
