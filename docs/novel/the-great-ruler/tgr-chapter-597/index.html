 <p><strong>Chapter 597 - The Finals</strong></p>
 <p>More than a hundred teams majestically stood on the sky. Their formation had attracted the attention of everyone in this region, along with unconcealable astonishment in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Even Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong and the rest of the team, with Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan included, were looking at the abrupt appearance of Lin Zhou’s group with astonishment in their eyes. Clearly, this was out of their expectations as well.</p>
 <p>“What is going on?” Wen Qingxuan involuntarily asked as she looked at Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>“Ji Xuan had his method and so I made my own preparations as well.” Mu Chen lightly smiled as he looked at Lin Zhou’s group and continued, “And, they are the preparations I have made.”</p>
 <p>“You’ve created a storage as well?” Shen Cangsheng spoke out in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“These teams owed me a favor. After that, I contacted Lin Zhou to contact the other teams with the hope that they could help me if there were any sudden changes.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen continued with a soft voice, “But, naturally, if Ji Xuan did not resort to any dishonorable methods, they also would not show themselves.”</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng and the team exchanged looks amongst themselves and couldn’t help smacking their lips. They were looking at Mu with odd gazes as these perfect preparations had thoroughly stunned them.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look at me with those gazes. I have fought with Ji Xuan too many times, so I have an understanding of his methods. In the Spiritual Road, I was tricked by him once. Although I was willing, I will not be tricked by him the second time.” Mu Chen smiled.</p>
 <p>“But, even if those teams do owe you a favor, it wouldn’t be so simple for them to give their points to you, right?” Luo Li’s clear pupils glanced at Mu Chen.</p>
 <p>Although only those in the Top 8 would proceed to the next round, while the rest were eliminated, that didn’t mean that those points had no use to those teams. If their points were too low in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament, the academy that they represent would be excluded out for the next tournament.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head as he spoke, “So I promised them 5 drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid per team.”</p>
 <p>Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan understood what was going on from Mu Chen’s words as they looked at him with peculiar gazes. It turns out that there was an important condition. After all, the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid wasn’t an ordinary item at their current cultivation.</p>
 <p>Thus, it wasn’t too surprising that those teams were willing to help Mu Chen for the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, including the favor they owed to him.</p>
 <p>“How are you going to get so much Sovereign Spiritual Liquid?” Luo Li asked in doubt. They hadn’t obtained so much Sovereign Spiritual Liquid back when they were at the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you can unseal the Spiritual Condensing Bowl?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded as he smiled. “Because of the fact that I have grown stronger, I tried using some methods. Although I wasn’t able to completely unseal the Spiritual Condensing Bowl, I managed to open a tiny crack. Through that crack, I was able to obtain over eight hundred drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid.”</p>
 <p>Luo Li nodded her head from Mu Chen’s answer. No wonder Mu Chen could be so generous, so it turns out that he had obtained a huge amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid.</p>
 <p>“That’s filthy rich.” Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong and the rest smacked their lips. An ordinary person could definitely not give out something like five hundred drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid so easily. The Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was important to even Sovereign experts, not to mention those that were around their levels who had yet to come in contact with Sovereign Realm.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to do this as well…”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen sighed as he let out a mouthful of air. Five hundred drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was not a small amount. Even if Mu Chen had the Spiritual Condensing Bowl, he was heart pained at this decision. But aside from this, he had no other way.</p>
 <p>He knew that Ji Xuan was sly, thus to keep things in check, he had to resort to unusual methods as well.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, you have already made your preparations, seems like I offered a favor for naught.” Wen Qingxuan’s slender eyes stared at Mu Chen as she said faintly after understanding what Mu Chen had said as she flung her lips aside.</p>
 <p>She was still quite worried earlier, but who could have expected that in an instant, Mu Chen had already flipped the unfavorable situation around? Although the latter had always maintained a cautious mindset, she was also slightly startled or even admired him. However, her prideful character made her feel unhappy. After all, with her character, it was extremely rare for her to have said those words earlier. But who could have imagined that, in the end, she was the one overthinking the situation?</p>
 <p>Mu Chen stared at Wen Qingxuan’s charming face for a long time, before speaking with an earnest tone, “Although my methods were in place to keep Ji Xuan in check, it isn’t too honorable as well. Thus, I have not spoken about it. Furthermore… thanks for that, Qingxuan.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s gaze stopped at Wen Qingxuan’s face. Seeing that the former was using an earnest gaze as he looked at her, her face was a little red, but she continued to make a strong front as she replied, “I’m not that close to you, what are you calling me? You only need to explain these matters to Luo Li, it has nothing to do with me. If it wasn’t for you traveling a long distance to rescue me back then, and in addition to my loathe for Ji Xuan, I wouldn’t bother myself with your matters.”</p>
 <p>Luo Li pursed her lips as she smiled from the side.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen also smiled as he knew how prideful Wen Qingxuan was, thus he did not speak any further and shifted his gaze to Lin Zhou’s group. He cupped his hands as he said, “Captain Lin Zhou, I express my gratitude for this.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, what are you talking about, Brother Mu? We have all received favor from you and, naturally, we will return the favor you gave us.” Lin Zhou roared with laughter as he waved his hand. Over a hundred other Captains from various teams took out their Academy Plaques as their plaques flickered with light, turning into streaks of light as they flew out.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen raised the Academy Plaque in his hand as rays of light surged, absorbing all those lights directed at him.</p>
 <p>As the lights were absorbed, the Academy Plaque in Mu Chen’s hand glowed with radiance. Along with it, his points were soaring at a terrifying speed.</p>
 <p>180,000… 200,000… 230,000… 260,000…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After reaching 260,000 points, it finally slowed down and the scarlet points instantly made every team in this region suck in a mouthful of chilled air.</p>
 <p>The points of Mu Chen’s team had flown by nearly 100,000.</p>
 <p>When Mu Chen’s points soared, the team led by Mu Chen went up as well, surpassing Ji Xuan and stood firmly at the Numero Uno.</p>
 <p>In less than half an hour, the Numero Uno ranking had changed its owner again!</p>
 <p>Mu Chen looked at the drastic increase of his points with a faint smile. Thereafter, he cupped his hands towards Lin Zhou’s group and waved his hand, more than a hundred streaks of light flew out from his sleeve towards the direction of Lin Zhou’s party.</p>
 <p>Lin Zhou’s party knew what Mu Chen’s action meant as they grabbed a streak of light each with their hands. The streaks of light turned into sparkling and translucent jade bottles. Inside those jade bottles, there were five drops of sparkling Sovereign Spiritual Liquid roaming inside, emitting astonishing Spiritual Energy fluctuations at the same time.</p>
 <p>Looking at the Sovereign Spiritual Liquids contained within the jade bottle, the eyes of Lin Zhou’s group were surging with unconcealable excitement. Soon after, all of them deeply cupped their hands at Mu Chen to express their gratitude.</p>
 <p>Numerous teams in this region were looking at Mu Chen with complicated glances. Who could have imagined that the hopeless situation had flipped around under the smile of that youth?</p>
 <p>“How formidable.” A soft sigh resounded. In this sort of situation, no one would criticise Mu Chen’s methods. After all, they were well aware that the way Ji Xuan obtained his points wasn’t honorable as well. All Mu Chen did was giving Ji Xuan a taste of his own medicine.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen and Ji Xuan are both monstrous characters. Who knows how intense their battle will be in the Finals when they face against each other…”</p>
 <p>On the mountain peak, Mu Chen’s gaze fell onto Shen Cangsheng and the rest of the party as he solemnly said, “The Finals will soon begin and I hope that the two teams of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy can be reorganized to participate the Finals with our strongest.”</p>
 <p>“We’ll heed your instructions.” Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, Xu Huang, He Yao and the rest nodded their heads with heavy expressions.</p>
 <p>“I plan to reorganize the two teams with Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, and Su Xuan joining my team.” Mu Chen looked at He Yao, Zhao Qingshan and the rest of the group. Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong, and Su Xuan were the strongest aside from him and Luo Li. Thus, if they could reorganize their team, it would naturally become a powerful formation.</p>
 <p>“I have no opinions except for one request.” He Yao, Zhao Qingshan, Mu Fengyang and the others exchanged a look as they smiled. They weren't bothered by this matter as they understood the importance of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s victory.</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“Defeat Ji Xuan for us!” He Yao’s group said with heavy voices.</p>
 <p>“Leave it to me.” Mu Chen smiled as he extended his hand out.</p>
 <p>Luo Li also extended her slender hand out as she placed it on top of Mu Chen’s. Su Xuan, Shen Cangsheng, Li Xuantong followed after as fighting intent blazed in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“The Seniors and Juniors of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy are waiting for us, we can’t let them be disappointed.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen placed his other hand on the Academy Plaque as he looked at Wen Qingxuan, “Qingxuan, are you ready?”</p>
 <p>Wen Qingxuan was also holding onto her Academy Plaque as she raised her brows at Mu Chen with laughter. “If we are unlucky and meet each other in the Finals, don’t blame me for not having any leniency. Our cooperation ends here.”</p>
 <p>“Likewise.”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen laughed as his black pupils surged with spirit.</p>
 <p>Tssssssss!</p>
 <p>The Academy Plaque in Mu Chen’s hand turned red as a flame sprouted out, engulfing his Academy Plaque.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Wen Qingxuan had also ignited hers.</p>
 <p>Every single team in this region was looking at this scene with complicated expressions. Eight of the Top 16 had ignited their Academy Plaques, meaning this tournament that lasted nearly half a year had finally come to an end.</p>
 <p>Coming up next would be the decisive battle that everyone would be focused on.</p>
 <p>Whooooosh!</p>
 <p>When the Academy Plaques in Mu Chen and Wen Qingxuan’s hand lit up, every single Academy Plaque in this tournament combusted as well, turning into radiant pillars of light as they engulfed the teams within them…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Countless pillars of light soared over the horizon.</p>
 <p>At this instant, fighting intent filled the entire heavens and earth.</p>
