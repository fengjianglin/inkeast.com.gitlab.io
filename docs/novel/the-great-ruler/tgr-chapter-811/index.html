At the same time, every expert in this mountain range had their face changed drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the terrifying Spiritual Energy pressure enveloped this entire region, many experts felt the circulation of their Spiritual Energy in their body had slowed down.</span></p>

Because the majority of the Spiritual Energy pressure was directed at him. Right now, he felt as though space around him had been forcefully frozen by the Spiritual Energy pressure.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that direction, space violently distorted as a person strode out from the distorted space. He wore an azure robe with a stunning bearing, looking extremely imposing. Just the coldness in his gaze alone had caused the temperature in this region to drop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood on the sky with both his hands hung down, but the entire region seemed to pour towards him. Every expert in this region could felt an overpowering pressure, so much so that they couldn’t straighten their body from the pressure.</span></p>

No one had expected for a pinnacle figure, Liu Tiandao to make his appearance here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, there were many sympathetic gazes directed at Mu Chen. Before an Earth Sovereign Realm powerhouse, it was practically impossible for the latter to have any chance left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying pressure had caused Mu Chen’s muscles to twitch. However, even when he was sweating on his back, there wasn’t any shock revealed on his face as he raised his head and looked at Liu Tiandao with his voice resonating in this region, “Palace Master Liu, there’s a rule of taking responsibility themselves for anything that happens in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven. Perhaps are you going to disregard your status and take revenge against me for Liu Yan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rules?”</span></p>

There weren’t any emotions in his eyes as he looked at Mu Chen and spoke with indifference, “Do you not know that we are the one that determines the rules of this Northern Region? How laughable for you to speak about rules before this seat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s heart sunk as he never thought that Liu Tiandao would disregard his identity and make his move against him. If that was the case, then he wouldn’t be able to escape no matter how many means he possesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, just a local overlord of the Northern Region, what a great tone of speech you have.” Just when Mu Chen’s gaze was flickering with thoughts on escaping, a cold mockery rang out behind him. It was Cai Xiao’s voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl had her hair fluttering in the wind as she stood quietly behind Mu Chen. There was a sneer hung on her face without any fear in her alluring eyes as she looked at Liu Tiandao. On the contrary, it was filled with ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts in this region were dumbstruck as this was the first time that they had witnessed someone daring to speak such a way at an Earth Sovereign powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ignorant brat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Tiandao cast an indifferent glance at Cai Xiao before stretching his hand out and suddenly clenched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space before him had directly crumbled, forming into a huge Spiritual Energy hand that dazzled with spiritual light. It was like a gorgeous hand of jewels, but it was the sign of Spiritual Energy being compressed to a terrifying level. It wasn’t something that ordinary Sovereigns could achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, when Spiritual Energy was compressed to such degree, the might would also reach a terrifying height.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling Spiritual Energy hand was extremely swift as it had pierced through space in a flash, directly appearing above Mu Chen and Cai Xiao. Mu Chen’s face drastically changed at the sight of this as he pulled Cai Xiao to his back as dark-golden light soared into the horizon from his body. Golden tattoos of dragon and phoenix appeared on his front and back respectively as they started to blaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he knew that it was impossible for him to confront a powerhouse like Liu Tiandao no matter what method did he use, he had to give it a try regardless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling Spiritual Energy palm abruptly landed. However, just when Mu Chen had clenched his teeth, prepared to endure that annihilation attack, space suddenly tore apart above him as a petite figure appeared. She gently pushed her tiny hands up as the Spiritual Energy palm was destroyed with space being torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Spiritual Energy impact swept out, Mu Chen had raised his head in shock as well. He saw a familiar petite figure standing on the sky as space emitted crackling sound from the terrifying Spiritual Energy fluctuation that flowed around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mandala!”</span></p>

Finally, his reinforcement had come. Otherwise, it would be extremely hard for him to leave today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another uproar rose in this region. Although Mandala’s appearance was unfamiliar to many experts here, her identity and strength could be determined from the terrifying Spiritual Energy fluctuation undulating around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be able to confront Liu Tiandao and would come out to protect Mu Chen. Aside from the Domain Lord of the Great Havenlaw Domain, who else could it be?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, ordinary people couldn’t catch a glimpse of an Earth Sovereign powerhouse, a pinnacle expert in the Northern Region. But right now, the powerhouses of two peak forces had actually appeared here…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this not make the hearts of many experts to shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up on the sky, Mandala wore a black dress with golden flowery patterns embroidered on it, seeming extremely honourable. She paid no attention to the commotion here as she looked at Mandala with her big eyes that seemed like gems as she reprimanded, “Rude, you should call me Domain Lord!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before she even finished speaking, a rare satisfied smile had already appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad, you have not embarrass our Great Havenlaw Domain this time.” Judging from her tone, she must know about Mu Chen’s achievements in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I nearly got myself killed.” Mu Chen said unhappily. If Mandala had appeared slightly later, he would have been killed by Liu Tiandao. After all, he had no confidence in receiving that attack from Liu Tiandao earlier on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, he can’t kill anyone of my Great Havenlaw domain.” Mandala faintly smiled. Although her voice was tender, it was impossible and extremely domineering.</span></p>

My Sky Profound Palace will definitely not let this matter rest!”</span></p>

If your Sky Profound Palace wants to start away, my Great Havenlaw Domain will welcome anytime.”</span></p>

You alone are still not qualified to snatch anyone from my hands.” However, facing Liu Tiandao’s killing intent, Mandala doesn’t seem to be bothered.</span></p>

She saw a torrential sea of blood pouring over from her rear as a blood shadow had appeared in a flash at the end of the horizon. In a few breaths’ time, that person had already appeared here.</span></p>

In the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, Chi Xue from the Serpent God Palace seems to have fallen in Cai Xiao’s hands.</span></p>

Although the characteristics of snake was lustful, he could suppress it to a certain degree upon reaching his level. But right now, there was an uncontrollable pounding in his heart when he saw Cai Xiao. He had no idea why but he feels that if he could obtain this girl before him, it would greatly benefit his cultivation and he might even take another step out!</span></p>

Just when he was about to speak, he was gently blocked by Cai Xiao’s hand as a smile filled with allure appeared on her face. She slightly tilted her head as she chuckled, looking at the Myriad Viper Sovereign while crooking her finger provocatively. Her clear and cold laughter had also sounded out in this region.</span></p>

 <p>Missed uploading chapters yesterday, but here's today. Just to let everyone know, there will be a slight delay in chapters for today as well. It's 4am in the morning right now and there's a family member going to have a minor surgery in 5 hours time. So I'll try to rush a few chapters.</p>
 <p>I'll also be staying at home for the next week to take care of that family member, so I'll be able to make up for the lost chapters!</p>
 <p>PS: It's a minor surgery of broken nasal and I heard it'd only take a few hours and we'll be able to go home. I'll start translating as soon as I reach home. Don't worry, there won't be any owing chapters!</p>
