Gazes of the Great Havenlaw Army were looking at the young silhouette from the surrounding platforms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of a Second Grade Sovereign wasn’t considered the peak in the Great Havenlaw Army. Not to mention a Second Grade Sovereign, even peak warriors with their strength at Third Grade Sovereign could not hunt a 100-year-old Spiritual Fire Python so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow that the Ruler had brought here herself did have some capability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many gazes flickered as the ridicule in their eyes faded. The Great Havenlaw Army was the most powerful troop in the Great Havenlaw Domain, all those that could enter had all undergone strict selection. So they had their own pride, even if Mandala was the Ruler, she couldn’t force them to accept trash willingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, Mu Chen had used his own strength to let them know what sort of attitude they should use to treat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, pretty good strength.” Within the Four Commanders, a robust man was looking at Mu Chen with astonishment as a smear of smile appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the Second Commander of the Five Commanders in the Great Havenlaw Domain, Commander Tie Shan, one whose strength reached the height of peak Fifth Grade Sovereign. As he spoke, not even ice-cold Commander Bing Qing could say anything more. Because the strength that Mu Chen had displayed had also left her especially shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t belittle him, he defeated Qin Bei of the Great Compassion Sky in the Expedition War.” Mandala lightly said from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Commanders were slightly stunned. They had naturally heard of Qin Bei, but they did not think that he would be defeated by this young man before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like someone decent has come from the younger generation of Commanders in our Great Havenlaw Domain.” Bing Qing looked at Mu Chen and said. As she spoke, she seemed rather disdainful of the so-called “Four Great Commanders” of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she did have the qualification to be in disdain. After all, even Xu Qing’s strength, which was at Third Grade Sovereign, wasn’t much before Bing Qing, who was a Fifth Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because the Great Havenlaw Army was the true hidden card of the Great Havenlaw Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala’s golden pupils looked at Mu Chen, “You will stay here to train for the next three months. Three months from now, if you want to leave, then you have to pass through the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array that I have personally laid out. If you can’t get past it, then don’t think of coming out. I will also send someone else to participate in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array?” Mu Chen was stunned as he looked at the four Commanders that stood by the side. He realised that they were shocked as well, before looking at him with pitiful gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that?” Mu Chen felt something was amiss, but he could only brace himself and ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a level that the Ruler herself has laid out. Generally speaking, anyone that can get through it by themselves will possess the qualifications to be promoted as a Commander. Except that after all these years, the amount of those that can get pass it is few in number.” Bing Qing’s rosy lips curled. With her ice-cold character, she also couldn’t help feeling happy from others calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Mu Chen’s mouth twitched. It was actually the Commander-level of the Great Havenlaw Domain. According to his estimation, even a Fourth Grade Sovereign would have a hard time getting through the so-called “Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array”. And here, Mandala used it as his condition for leaving, it was simply harsh and strict…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for the fact that there wasn’t any conflict between him and Mandala, he might have thought that Mandala was messing with him on purpose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? You don’t dare?” Mandala’s golden eyes looked at Mu Chen as she thoughtfully said, “If you don’t even have that much confidence and courage, then it will be hard to believe that there’s any chance for you to win when you face those competitors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned as he looked at Mandala. He clearly understood that there was a deeper meaning hidden in her words. She had once told him that in this world, there might be other outstanding geniuses that had obtained great opportunities as well, thus refining the Great Solar Undying Body. Yet, there was only one Primordial Immortal Body. If he wanted to obtain the final success, then it would be unavoidable for him to face opponents that had gotten similar opportunities…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could only imagine how terrifying those opponents were, they weren’t something that the competitors he met up to now could be compared to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, under the gaze of Mandala’s golden pupils, Mu Chen lightly nodded his head. There wasn’t any power in this world that came without any price. If he wished to obtain it, then he would have to pay the price in exchange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ordinary people could only see his dazzling and soaring achievements, but not the bitter training he had to pay for those achievements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Tie Shan, Bing Qing and the rest of the Four Commanders saw Mu Chen daring to agree to it, their gazes were strange. But the depths of their eyes turned much more gentle, since the courage that Mu Chen had displayed made them somewhat impressed. After all, not just anyone would dare to casually barge into the Nine-Nine Fire Dragon Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mandala nodded in satisfaction as a smear of a rare smile appeared on her face. “Then, I will wait for your good news. The Commanders will instruct you on the ways of training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finishing her words, her figure flashed and disappeared. That swift speed left Mu Chen and the Commanders in envy. Before an Earth Sovereign expert, they were as weak as a baby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing Mandala’s departure, Mu Chen turned his gaze towards Tie Shan, Bing Qing and the remaining Four Commanders and cupped his fists. “I will be troubling the Four Commanders for the next three months.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tie Shan laughed as he waved his hand. Although he seemed like an iron tower, he wasn’t stupid. Judging from Mandala and Mu Chen’s tones, the relationship between them wasn’t just between the high up Ruler and puny Commander. So he didn’t dare to act too casual with Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let Bing Qing inform you the cultivation ways of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond. You can look for us as well, if there’s any issue.” Tie Shan smiled at Mu Chen. Only Bing Qing remained as the three Commanders returned to the surrounding platforms to check on the training of the Great Havenlaw Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Qing stared at Mu Chen with her ice-cold pupils and faintly said, “I don’t know what your relationship is with the Ruler. But since she left you here, then I will be demanding from you the strictest performance requirement of the Great Havenlaw Army.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled and nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How will I start cultivating?” Mu Chen asked straightforwardly without any attempt to blanter with the cold beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Initially, I was intending for you to be like the other warriors of the Great Havenlaw Army, cultivating on those platforms. But since you are capable of dealing with the Spiritual Fire Pythons, then I will lead you to the deeper parts of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond. In the future, you will be hunting Spiritual Fire Pythons to obtain their Spiritual Fire Marrow to quicken your speed of cultivation,” said Bing Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In addition, the inner parts of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond’s temperature are extremely high. With your strength, you can only go a thousand feet down and that will be your limit. Furthermore, there are more powerful Spiritual Fire Pythons in the deeper parts that you will not be able to deal with, with your current strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even more powerful ones?” Mu Chen was somewhat startled. This Greatlaw Blaze Pond was indeed no kind place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Spiritual Fire Python that you have hunted previously had only lived for 100 years. The older it is, the more powerful it is. It can be determined from its size. But as long as you don’t barge into the deeper parts, you will not encounter those powerful Spiritual Fire Pythons.” Although Bing Qing was cold in her heart, she gave Mu Chen a detailed explanation for his doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is the Spiritual Fire Marrow more pure the more powerful it was?” Mu Chen smacked his lips. He had just previously refined a 100-year-old Spiritual Fire Marrow. If he got one with an older age, the effect must be better as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Qing couldn’t help rolling her eyes at Mu Chen. The age of this fellow wasn’t too old, but he was very arrogant. Who didn’t want to obtain the Spiritual Fire Marrow of a Spiritual Fire Python that had exceeded a lifespan of 500 or even 1000 years? But, he needed to have the capability as well.</span></p>

Since you are so confident, I will bring you to a place with a great harvest.” Bing Qing’s rosy lips rose. Shortly after, she flew down towards the depths of the Greatlaw Blaze Pond below. Seeing her movement, Mu Chen immediately followed after.</span></p>

It was practically an underground magma ocean. A complicated terrain was formed from the melting of magma in the surrounding abyss and huge caves came in all shapes and sizes, seemingly like a maze.</span></p>

Approximately ten minutes later, Bing Qing finally slowed down her speed.</span></p>

But at this moment, there were Spiritual Fire Pythons wriggling on the surface of the magma ocean, bringing up large magma vortexes.</span></p>

She gently waved her arm as she introduced, with her lips pulsed, “Welcome to the Greatlaw Blaze Pond, Hell Mode.”</span></p>
