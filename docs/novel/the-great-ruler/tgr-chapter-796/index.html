 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark-gold pillar of light stood towering in this region, as if it had penetrated through the dense layers of clouds. Under the shine of the dark-gold pillar, the entire Dragon-Phoenix Stage had become dazzling at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned as they looked at the unique dark-gold pillar of light as the light shone onto their faces, causing changes in their facial expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not know why Mu Chen’s reading would have this result, what did that mean? Did that represent the density of the True Dragon and Phoenix’s Blood Essences in Mu Chen’s body being so strong that none of them could compare to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the previous readings, Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince had already formed the True Dragon Physiques, which was rather shocking. But who could have expected Mu Chen to have an even more terrifying reading result…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just to what degree was the density of the True Dragon and Phoenix’s Blood Essences in his body? How did he obtain so much Blood Essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did the countless experts in this region have their faces filled with shock, but even those on the Dragon-Phoenix Stage were exchanging looks as they felt something inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince had their brows slightly narrowed as they looked at Mu Chen’s pillar of light with their flickering gazes. Their gazes lightly intertwined, before being shifted away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Biyue, Hong Yu, Ding Xuan and the rest also had grave expressions as they felt the pressure emitting from Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan’s face had never been good, but right now, it was even darker as the killing intent deep in his eyes turned denser.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark-gold pillar of light remained for a long while under the gazes of everyone, before it gradually weakened and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s shut eyes had slowly opened at this moment and he cast a glance at this quiet Dragon-Phoenix Stage. He lightly frowned and quietly circulated the Spiritual Energy in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clearly beyond his expectations to have the Blood Essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix in his body to be suddenly revealed. If it was possible, Mu Chen did not wish for it to be revealed as it would easily make him the target of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because that meant that he had the highest chance of receiving the inheritance of the True Dragon and Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That also meant that it would be unavoidable to attract hatred out of jealousy. Regarding this point, it could be seen from the faintly discernible cautious gazes that were cast over. However, those gazes were initially at Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince, most of the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But fortunately, he was here with Cai Xiao, so the other experts did not dare to have any unusual actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the light dispersed, this Dragon-Phoenix Stage turned quiet once again. Many experts had their gazes flickered, but no one dared to take the initiative to have any unusual actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head and looked at the layers of stone stages formed from phoenix wings. Clearly, the inheritance of the True Dragon and Phoenix must be at the summit of this Dragon-Phoenix Stage. So if he wanted to obtain the inheritance, he would first have to ascend the summit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that could ascend the peak would have a chance of obtaining the inheritance. But right now, no one dared to break this deadlock so easily in order to attract the hostility of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen knew that his deadlock wouldn’t last for long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the one that broke this deadlock was Fang Yi, the well-reputed first on the Dragon-Phoenix Record. He cast a glance at Mu Chen and Cai Xiao, before saying with a light smile, “Since everyone is unwilling to move first, then let me have the honour of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a courageous capable man and was clearly not bothered about others acting towards him. He did not wait for anyone’s reply. He stomped his feet and his figure flew up, leaving afterimages in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant Fang Yi moved, the Netherworld Prince’s figure had turned into a dark light as he streaked across the horizon like a bolt of lightning. Swiftly throwing the layers of stone stages behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them moved, it instantly broke the silence on the Dragon-Phoenix Stage. Every expert had Spiritual Energy sweep from their bodies like a hurricane. As the stone stage trembled, numerous figures flew into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Cai Xiao exchanged a glance as they turned into streaks of light and flew out as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless gazes in this region were directed at the soaring streaks of light and were instantly stirred. Because they knew that the competition on the Dragon-Phoenix Stage had been thoroughly unfolded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Except they did not know who would be the one that managed to ascend to the peak. But no matter what, there would also be a change in the Dragon-Phoenix Record of the Northern Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swiftly executed his speed to his limits, turning into a light figure as he transcended the layers of stone stages. Raising his head and looking up, he wrapped his voice with Spiritual Energy and transmitted to Cai Xiao, “The number of stone stages will decrease as we go up. And the stone stages are necessary to ascend the peak, so we have to each occupy one Dragon-Phoenix Stage at that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the information that Mu Chen had obtained, although there were many Dragon-Phoenix Stages at the bottom level and could accommodate all of them and there wouldn’t be a need for competition, but as they went higher, the number of Dragon-Phoenix Stages would decrease as well. At that time, there would be a situation of having more people than stages, so in the end, an intense battle would still break out as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his words, Cai Xiao gently nodded her head. “You be careful at that time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nearly a hundred streaks of light soared into the horizon like comets as they continued to cross over the Dragon-Phoenix Stage, which was forged with gold. It was an extremely spectacular scene. However, everyone gradually clenched their fists as they started to feel many violent Spiritual Energies secretly surging around those streaks of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The number of Dragon-Phoenix Stages are decreasing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone exclaimed. Everyone directed their gazes over as, indeed, they saw that in the distant heavens, the number of Dragon-Phoenix Stages, which was initially high in number, was decreasing. Roughly looking at them, they were clearly incapable of supporting everyone to ascend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a split to the nearly hundred streaks of light. Those figures up ahead had taken the initiative as they flew out like bolts of lightning, occupying the Dragon-Phoenix Stages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, not a single one of those that could arrive there were easy to deal with. Trying to have them accept the rule of first come first serve was clearly impossible as well. Therefore, there were some people with ferocious lights flickering in their eyes as they charged to those occupied Dragon-Phoenix Stages as violent Spiritual Energy soared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent Spiritual Energies swept out on multiple Dragon-Phoenix Stages. It was practically an instant when the somewhat harmonious atmosphere was wiped away, replaced with soaring killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and Cai Xiao did not slow down, so they had each occupied a Dragon-Phoenix Stage at the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when Mu Chen was about to ascend the peak, an extremely violent Spiritual Energy fluctuation burst out from his rear along with a bark, “Scram!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen maintained a calm expression as a golden light vaguely flowed on the surface of his skin, forming into dense golden dragon scales as he threw a palm back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Palms heavily clashed together as visible ripples could be seen. However, Mu Chen’s figure did not move, but the figure behind him took several steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising his head, Mu Chen saw a black-robed guy eerily looking at him. Mu Chen had never seen this person before, but judging from the Spiritual Energy fluctuations on him, he had reached Fourth Grade Sovereign. However, there was still a big gap between him and Liu Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Chen Fan of the Ghostly Shadow Sect, I’ll have to ask you to give way.” The black-robed guy eerily looked at Mu Chen with a ferocious light filling his eyes. Although he knew that Mu Chen wasn’t simple, it clearly wasn’t a reason for him to back off. Furthermore, Mu Chen and Cai Xiao had split up right now, so he had intended to take advantage of this and crash his way through Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen’s black pupils had only stared at him with indifference, before turning around to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Fan instantly smiled from the rage at this situation. Although Mu Chen wasn’t simple, did he think himself to be Fang Yi? He actually dared to disregard him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A boundless Spiritual Energy burst out from his body as a huge black figure was formed. The black figure was shrouded in ominous aura like an asura. Chen Fan had no intentions of probing, since he had summoned his Sovereign Celestial Body right from the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ghostly Shadow Celestial Body, Myriad Shadow Demon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A red light flashed in the black figure’s eyes as it threw a palm out. Beneath its palm, an earth-shattering amount of black shadows surged, it was like a ghost, emitting ear-piercing shrieks. The terrifying fluctuation had instantly caused space to distort.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, there were a lot of attention focused on Mu Chen, so when they saw the stone stage he was on burst out with a Spiritual Energy shock wave, it instantly attracted many astonished gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, they weren’t the only ones paying attention to the stone stage that Mu Chen was on. There were also some gazes from other stone stages directed over. Although their stone stages had violent Spiritual Energies, no one dared to lay their feet on their stages.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had directed their gazes at Mu Chen’s stone stage.

 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ghost shrieks covered the sky as the huge palm of the black figure had enveloped Mu Chen under countless gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s step stood firmly in that huge shadow as he raised his head, emotionlessly looking at the black palm that was enveloping him. Shortly after, he suddenly clenched his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dazzling golden light burst out from his body, and in the next instant, it was like a blazing sun was emitting a dazzling golden light that made many people narrow their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this instant, those with keen sights saw a pair of phoenix wings unfolding behind Mu Chen when the golden light appeared.

A fine golden light spread out from its palm, spreading to the head of the Ghostly Shadow Celestial Body…</span></p>

In it, a pathetic figure flew out, with a mouthful of blood, before powerlessly falling from the sky, causing a mountain peak fall into ruins…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless gazes in this region were dumbfounded as they watched this scene. Thereafter, patches of inhaled chilled air resounded as numerous trembling gazes looked at the slender figure, which was slowly striding forth.</span></p>
