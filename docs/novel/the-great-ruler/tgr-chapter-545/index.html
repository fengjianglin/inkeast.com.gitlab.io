They made the air in the entire region seem as if it had frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re going to execute three Lesser Divine Arts!”</span></p>

Everyone here knew how powerful Divine Arts were and generally speaking, they were the means of Sovereign realm experts. Every single Divine Art possessed powerful might that far surpassed Peak Grade Deity Tier Spiritual Art. Likewise, a Divine Art was extremely rare as well and it was not easy to obtain one. Those that obtained one would possess a trump card that could change the entire situation when they executed it at a crucial time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when they saw that Xue Tiandou, Wang Zhong and Mo Yu executed three Lesser Divine Arts, they were startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Tiandou and his group was clearly planning to deal with Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan with haste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But why are the Lesser Divine Arts being executed by them have such similar ripples…?” Everyone here also had good eyesight and could see that those three Lesser Divine Arts had similar energy ripples as they voiced their doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yingying and the Four Sea Spiritual Academies weren’t in doubt as they knew that those Lesser Divine Arts were from the Divine Wood Plaques that Xue Tiandou and the other two had obtained. Similarly, when they obtained the Divine Wood Plaques, they had also obtained the learning method to a Lesser Divine Art of the Divine Wood Palace. The level of a Lesser Divine Art was of great aid to them. After all, it was something that only Sovereign realm experts could use in their level. Although they could barely execute them and could not unleash the true might of them, Divine Arts were still Divine Arts, they were in a whole different realm. Those who possessed a Lesser Divine Art could easily defeat opponents of the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan were being held up by the attacks of the three Divine Wood Guards, as well as the eight puppets. The two girls had also felt the powerful attacks brewing as their charming eyes instantly focused. They could see that their current situation wasn’t too good. If they were to fight one-to-one, they would triumph against any single one of them. If Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan were to use their hidden cards, not even Xue Tiandou could obstruct them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, right now was not a fair fight, since the other party had a more powerful formation. Furthermore, not a single one of them was an easy target. Despite the fact that they had the help of a Divine Wood Guard, they were still weaker in terms of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that slow fellow still not done yet? If he pisses me off, I will not leave anything for him!”</span></p>

She took a glance at the rear, looking at Mu Chen, who was still quietly sitting. However, there was a huge Spiritual Array that was gradually taking form around him. Clearly, the Spiritual Array was still incomplete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Everyone raised their heads as their eyes were filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a majestic Spiritual Energy gathering above Xue Tiandou and the other two. Those Spiritual Energies were green in colour, as if they contained thriving vitality. Underneath them, there was a sharpness hidden as they seemed as weightless as leaves. They were swaying as they fell, but when they swept past, they were as sharp as blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The top of the mountain was filled with ancient tree patterns as if it became three mountains. It dived down as it instantly appeared above the heads of Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan. The shadow created by it instantly shrouded them as it heavily fell down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>

It had the shape of a dragon’s head on the top. As it roared, it unleashed frightening sound waves that could shatter all things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhhuuuu!</span></p>

As it wriggled, it was hard to probe the direction of it's attacks. The instant one was bound by it, even First Grade Spirit Disaster experts would have a hard time breaking free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three astonishing attacks were positioned top, middle, and bottom as they flew towards Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan’s direction. Under those sorts of attacks, it was impossible for them to dodge them.</span></p>

She knew that Luo Li’s strength was not as she had shown on the surface. The Luo God Sword that she was wielding was a genuine Divine Artifact. Furthermore, it wasn’t an ordinary Divine Artifact. However, the Divine Artifact was being sealed at the moment, but even so, Luo Li’s attacks were extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Luo Li nodded her head.</span></p>

Her slender fingers formed seals at lightning speed. A clear cry of a phoenix resounded as golden phoenix wings that were a few hundred meters in length spread out from Wen Qingxuan. Both of the wings folded as they formed a golden shield, defending her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>

Her hands that were gripping the Luo God Sword burst forth with dazzling light as both her hands held onto the sword hilt. She raised her hand as her sleeves fell down, revealing her fair and fine wrist. The snow-white skin was even more attractive compared to the sword light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her expression turned a little grave as she bit on her lips.
