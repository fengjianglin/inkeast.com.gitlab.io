 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We greet Commander Mu Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the trio had no other choice but to be convinced, the Nine Nether Troop lowered their heads as orderly thunderous voices rang across the field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen calmly looked at the army that seemed like thunderclouds and shifted his gaze onto Qiu Shan and the other two. “You guys are the Seniors of the Nine Nether Troop. After all these years, you guys have not left when the Nine Nether Troop was at the toughest moment. As the new Commander, I will naturally reward and punish fairly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he paused for a brief moment. After looking at the astonished gazes of Qiu Shan and the other two, he continued his speech, “This is the refining method of the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body, I will pass it to the three of you in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavenly Flames Celestial Body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Shan and the other two had their faces changed as they looked at Mu Chen with disbelief. “The Heavenly Flames Celestial Body that is the 97th ranking?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only them, even the Nine Nether Troop broke into a commotion. They had naturally heard of the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body. At this moment, their eyes were burning with fire. Although the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body was ranked towards the rear, it was still a ranked Sovereign Celestial Body. It was many times stronger than those unranked Sovereign Celestial Bodies. Even in the Great Havenlaw Domain, a Sovereign Celestial Body of such a level wasn’t something that just anyone could cultivate. But, right now, Mu Chen was using it as a reward, this hand of his wasn’t small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Commander!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the temptation of the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body, the faces of the Qiu Shan trio turned excited as they cupped their hands and spoke with respect. The dissatisfaction that they had in their hearts was also removed. After all, someone that could casually take out the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body as a reward, despite his age, his temperament wasn’t something that they could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen waved his hand and swept his gaze across the field. “In the future, as long as there is sufficient contributions, not only can you obtain sufficient amounts of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids to break through to the Sovereign Realm, after a successful breakthrough, you will also obtain the opportunity to use the cultivation method of the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body. Of course, whether you can succeed in refining it will depend on yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another commotion broke out amongst the Nine Nether Troop. Many people had heated gazes as they licked their lips. They knew about the situation the Nine Nether Palace was in for all these years, so they had been frugal with using Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. Although no one said a word, anyone would wish that they could obtain more Sovereign Spiritual Liquids to quicken their cultivating speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, breaking through to the Sovereign Realm required a large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, so they needed to prepare for a long time. But Mu Chen’s words had resolved their greatest worries, not to mention that there was still the temptation of the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But, our Nine Nether Palace had been resting ourselves, how will we get battle contributions?” There were some keen people in the Nine Nether Palace that spoke out in soft tones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone recovered as they nodded their heads. For all these years, their Nine Nether Troop had not gone out to battle. Although their territories were seized, there was no leader in their Nine Nether Palace, so they did not dare to act out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen said indifferently, “In the future, we will take back what is ours. If anyone dares to bully us, you are allowed to act. Since we will no longer have anymore easy days, if you are unsatisfied, you can leave the Nine Nether Troop. In the future, the Nine Nether Troop will become the sharpest spear of the Nine Nether Palace and face any enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his speech was calm, it made everyone in the Nine Nether Troop stunned. Thereafter, their bodies trembled with excitement, some people even had their eyes turning red. It had been too tough for them for all these years. Among the Great Havenlaw Domain, their Nine Nether Troop had the lowest standing. No matter where they went, they would attract disdainful gazes. Some vicious people even called their Nine Nether Palace a woman’s palace, their Nine Nether Troop a woman’s troop. However, for all these years, the Nine Nether Palace had chosen to endure all sorts of provocations. In the end, they even had to offer the qualifications for the Greatlaw Goldpond with their own hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, they became numb to it. So when they heard Mu Chen’s words, it lit up the fire in their hearts. At this moment, tidal waves swept in their hearts and they could no longer control themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will follow the orders of Commander!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single member of the Nine Nether Troop straightened their bodies as they roared at once, their voices were like the explosions of thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up on the stage, Tang Bing couldn’t help nibbling on her rosy lips, her gaze staring at that slender silhouette. No matter how strong she showed, she was not a man, thus lacked the hot-blooded nature that a man had deep down in his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Nine Nether Troop respected her, it was hard for their hearts to sweep with waves like right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it?” Nine Nether asked, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing gently nodded her head as she faintly laughed, “Big Sister Nine Nether has good eyesight. Mu Chen is so much better than Cao Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words paused as she lightly pouted and showed a rare young and ignorant look that a girl should have. “That fellow is too generous. How am I going to take out so much Sovereign Spiritual Liquid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing was the housekeeper of the Nine Nether Palace. Every single drop of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was under her control. In the past, her hands were tight as they passed their days, how can she be like Mu Chen, who spoke so grandly about providing sufficient Sovereign Spiritual Liquids to break through the Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s trying to nurture battle with battle.” Nine Nether lazily stretched her waist as a chill flashed across her slender eyes. “Just as Mu Chen has said before, the Nine Nether Palace will be changing its ways from tomorrow onwards. We will retrieve those things that belonged to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing silently nodded her head, she had a little expectation in her heart. She naturally hoped to see a Nine Nether Palace filled with vigorous and hot-blooded individuals, letting enemies feel their fearsome revenge. During all these years, the Nine Nether Palace had suffered all sorts of oppression. It wasn’t that she wasn’t angry in her heart, but the situation was stronger than people. Blood Hawk King was trying to force them to make the wrong move, so that he would have an excuse to disband their Nine Nether Palace. So, even if she had to endure the sufferings, she definitely wouldn’t give their opponent a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was somewhat satisfied from the grandeur displayed by the Nine Nether Palace and nodded his head. He no longer spoke as he turned around and returned to the platform. He knew that he had already thoroughly gotten the acknowledgment of the entire Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Never thought that this radish on a stick method of yours would be pretty skilled.” Nine Nether smiled as she looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smiled in response. This method of his wasn’t something new, but it was the most effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nine Nether Troop is pretty good.” Mu Chen praised. He was very satisfied with the Nine Nether Troop. Be it the grandeur or strength, this Nine Nether Troop wasn’t weak. There was only one flaw, there were too little members. However, the potential was very big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s for sure.” Tang Bing smiled, a trace of unconcealable pride in her eyes. For all these years, she had put all her heart into it. Otherwise, how could the Nine Nether Palace that had lost Nine Nether last until her return?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have worked hard Big Sister Tang Bing.” Mu Chen said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After losing Nine Nether, Tang Bing had contributed a lot and was able to train the Nine Nether Troop to this level, while enduring all sorts of provocations. It was indeed uneasy for a girl like her to achieve this much. No wonder she was well-respected by the Nine Nether Troop, even the Qiu Shan trio was the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could tell that if they had revere for Nine Nether, then what they had for Tang Bing was genuine respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing was slightly stunned. She looked at the smiling face before her and the soft spot of her heart seemed to be bumped. Her nose was a little sour. She had never spoken about her grievances for all these years, but that didn’t mean that there weren't any. After losing Nine Nether, the Nine Nether Palace needed someone to hold it up, and she was that example. So she could only put up a cold front as she worked hard and persevere till the return of Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest assured, Big Sister Tang Bing. I will trash those that dared to come provoke the Nine Nether Palace to the point that their parents will not recognize them in the future.” Mu Chen smiled. The smile on his face was radiant and warm right now, causing Tang Bing’s face to turn slightly red. It was rare that there wasn’t any of the cold front that she usually had as she gently nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But don’t speak those words for the sake of speaking them, you have to consider the large amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquids required for the Nine Nether Troop. That large amount isn’t sufficient, even if we sell you away.” Tang Bing’s expression swiftly returned to normal as she looked at Mu Chen and laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head, that was indeed a problem. Right now, the territories under the Nine Nether Palace were completely seized. The amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid couldn’t last a long time. So they still had to depend on themselves to last long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can only depend on you regarding this matter, but I will keep my eyes on Blood Hawk King.” Nine Nether lightly smiled. According to the rules of the Great Havenlaw Domain, no King could take direct actions. Every single competition could only be depended on their subordinates. Furthermore, the reason why Blood Hawk King wasn’t afraid of them was because he didn’t believe that the Nine Nether Palace could win against his Blood Hawk Hall with the little number of people they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head as he stretched his waist. His gaze was shot towards the distance and grew a little sharp, “After the competition for the Greatlaw Goldpond, we will start taking back what's ours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How’s your preparation?” Tang Bing was curious as she asked. After all, this was the first time in recent years that their Nine Nether Palace would be participating in the Greatlaw Goldpond, so the other forces would be paying attention to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything is as planned.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen let out a light smile as his brilliant eyes became filled with the splendor of self-confidence. He had already refined the Great Solar Undying Body, thus no longer afraid of any opponent of the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, this battle was extremely important for him and the Nine Nether Palace, so he couldn’t afford to treat it lightly.</span></p>
