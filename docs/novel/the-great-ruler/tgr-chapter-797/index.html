 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Spiritual Energy fluctuations dissipated on the stage that Mu Chen was on, the entire region remained in silence, with every single gaze fixed onto the slender figure standing in the middle of the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those gazes were filled with disbelief and astonishment. Clearly, Mu Chen’s feat of defeating a Fourth Grade Sovereign with a single move had greatly shaken them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes of Su Biyue and Hong Yu flickered as a trace of astonishment flashed across their faces. They had also heard of the fight between Mu Chen and Liu Yan, which ended with the both of them gravely injured. However, they did not witness it themselves and in addition to the powerful Cai Xiao, which followed him around, they were doubtful of the result from Mu Chen and Liu Yan’s fight if Cai Xiao had participated…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when they witnessed this scene, they had no choice but to believe. This fellow that appeared to be at Third Grade Sovereign and one that had never been in their eyes wasn’t as simple as they had thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no wonder why he would dare to fight with Liu Yan, so his strength was that powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to then, the faces of Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince were rather calm. Their eyes had only briefly narrowed when they saw the dazzling golden light that burst out from Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, they vaguely felt an oppressive pressure emanating from Mu Chen. That oppression wasn’t coming from his strength, but the Blood Essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the Blood Essences of the True Dragon and Phoenix that Mu Chen possessed had exceeded them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Fang Yi wasn’t surprised about this fact, since he knew how formidable the Super Dragon-Phoenix Pool that Mu Chen and Cai Xiao had found was. Furthermore, they even had two Dragon-Phoenix Fruits. If those two were mixed together, it was more than enough to for the True Dragon Physique or True Phoenix Physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Yi crossed his fingers as he slightly narrowed his eyes. Mu Chen’s strength was indeed pretty decent, but it was clearly not on the level that would make him feel fear. However, that the mysterious girl that followed him around was the troublesome one…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes, Mu Chen quietly stood on the Dragon-Phoenix Stage as he slowly swept his gaze out. Those experts that had not managed to gain a Dragon-Phoenix Stage couldn’t help shifting their gazes away with flickers. Those people that were initially planning to break through Mu Chen sweated cold sweat from their foreheads as they swiftly smashed that idea apart in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging from the strength that Mu Chen had revealed earlier, anyone would be a fool if they treated him like an ordinary Third Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, he wasn’t relying on that peerless and mysteriously powerful beauty to come this far… His own strength was not something to be underestimated as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they started to look for other targets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood at the centre of the Dragon-Phoenix Stage as he looked at the other stages. Extremely violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations were erupting from those stages as well with massive Sovereign Celestial Bodies continuously clashing, exploding shocking storms from their clashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, every single expert had their eyes turning red in order to compete for the Dragon-Phoenix Stages that could allow them to continue ascending, since they had revealed all the means they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, after the shock that Mu Chen had displayed earlier, there wasn’t any fool that went to disturb him. Thus, he was saved from many unnecessary troubles as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze swept at those Dragon-Phoenix Stages with erupting violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations, before shifting towards those peaceful ones. Vaguely, the figures on those stages could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one easily stepped onto those stages as they knew that the ones on those stages were true elites amongst the younger generations of the Northern Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those were people that were qualified to seek the summit of the Dragon-Phoenix Stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst those people, Mu Chen had seen Liu Yan. Right now, the latter also had his eyes fixed onto him with an eerie gaze. The sharpness held in his gaze seemed like it wanted to pierce through him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enmity between them could no longer be reconciled after their previous fight, as it could be seen from the unconcealed killing intent held in Liu Yan’s eyes. However, Mu Chen did not fear him before he had formed the Dragon-Phoenix Physique, not to mention that there was a great spike in his strength now. If they fought again, he would let Liu Yan understand that it would not be so easy for him to even aim for an outcome with the two of them gravely injured…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, facing Liu Yan’s sinister gaze, Mu Chen lightly swept his eyes over, before retracting his gaze and the corner of his eyes looked at the direction of Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to Liu Yan, he was more fearful of those unfathomable fellows. After all, they had managed to retreat from Cai Xiao’s moves in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wanted to ascend the summit of the Dragon-Phoenix Stage and obtain the inheritance, Fang Yi and the Netherworld Prince would undoubtedly be an obstruction for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when the thoughts spun in Mu Chen’s heart, the Spiritual Energy fluctuations emanating from some Dragon-Phoenix Stages became more intense. Clearly, those battles had reached the climax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under those intense battles, the outcomes were swiftly determined. In the sky, there were failures being knocked down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With them, the violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations in the sky had also gradually calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swept his gaze out and saw that on the 32 Dragon-Phoenix Stages that floated in the sky, all of them were occupied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only 32 left?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen smacked his lips. There were nearly a hundred elites that were qualified to ascend the Dragon-Phoenix Stage, but more than half of them were eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising his head and looking towards the distance, he could vaguely see 16 Dragon-Phoenix Stages floating in that golden light. Evidently, only 16 could remain in the next round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single layer would eliminate half, this elimination rate was simply brutal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz! Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was sighing at the brutal elimination rate, the Dragon-Phoenix Stage beneath him suddenly exploded with golden light. On the Dragon-Phoenix Stage, countless dragon scales and phoenix wings trembled. Vaguely, there was a trace of golden liquid that flowed across, which vaguely entered their bodies through their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dragon and Phoenix Blood Essences?!” Sensing that familiar energy in his body, Mu Chen’s eyelids instantly twitched. Looks like this was a little reward for the 32 of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon and Phoenix Blood Essences from the Dragon-Phoenix Stages were extremely pure, they were simply a fortune that fell from the sky for the other experts. But to Mu Chen, who had absorbed a Super Dragon-Phoenix Pool and refined a Dragon-Phoenix Fruit, it was merely decoration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dense golden light enveloped the 32 figures under the countless envious gazes. A long while later, the golden light burst out and soared up the azure sky along with 32 figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light was extremely fast, as if they had penetrated space, and appeared at the higher horizon in a flash. The golden light then dissipated as the 32 figures stood on the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before those 32 figures were 16 floating Dragon-Phoenix Stages that seemed to be forged with gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at those 16 Dragon-Phoenix Stages, no one spoke a single word. Fang Yi, the Netherworld Prince and those experts on the Dragon-Phoenix Record had landed on a Dragon-Phoenix Stage with calm expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s figure had flashed as he appeared on a Dragon-Phoenix Stage. Looking at those sharp gazes directed at him, he cupped his fists. “Any friend here wishes to exchange tips?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, there were some flickering gazes from the ten-plus figures that stood in the sky. In the end, a grey-robed man flew out and landed on Mu Chen’s stage. A sharp blade aura spread from his body, which caused the space to slightly distort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tyrantblade Sect, Yu Lu hopes to exchange tips!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that low bark rang out from the mouth of the grey-robed man, his figure flew as he burst out with an overbearing blade aura that soared across the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of this expert that came from the Tyrantblade Sect was somewhere around Mu Chen. Therefore, this match did not last very long. When that expert saw Mu Chen shattering his peerless blade aura with a single finger, he understood the gap between them. So he sensibly did not continue the fight and retreated with a cup of his fists, ending the challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle, Mu Chen won again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the following period of time, Mu Chen was like a sharp unsheathed sword as his peerless spirit was completely revealed. After getting into the Top 16, he defeated a genius expert that was similarly from a peak force in the Northern Region, and under countless shocked gazes, he entered into the Top 8!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the opponent he faced to compete for the Top 8 retreated after a fierce battle, Mu Chen let out a long breath of air as he raised his head, looking at the higher Dragon-Phoenix Stages. There were only 4 majestic Dragon-Phoenix Stages in that place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly clenched his fist,since he could sense that as the elimination went on, the opponents remaining became more powerful, each and every single one of them weren’t easy opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But since he had come this far, he would naturally ascend the summit to take a look. Even if Fang Yi, the Netherworld Prince and various other experts were his opponents, it was tough to make Mu Chen feel fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me see who can obstruct my steps!” Mu Chen grinned as battle intent blazed in his black pupils.</span></p>
