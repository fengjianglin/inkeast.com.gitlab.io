Shortly after, he dusted his hands off as his gaze swept towards the depths of the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already obtained sufficient amount of information from the person that was held hostage by him. Judging from the news, when Mo Yu, Qin Feng and the rest entered the Divine Wood Palace, they went for this place straight away. Clearly, this place was their target and were well-prepared. They dispatched dozens of teams. Adding all the numbers, they would have nearly two hundred men…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the main thing about it was that these people weren’t too outstanding in their cultivation of Spiritual Energy. The exception was that all these people had more or less cultivated in their physiques, which implied that their physical bodies were more powerful compared to ordinary experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were all placed outside and could use their Spiritual Energy, even if they had the advantage in numbers, Mu Chen wouldn’t fear them a little. However… under these special circumstances, it became a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If our news is right, Mo Yu, Qin Feng and the rest have already reached the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard. We were a step too late. Fortunately, there is a seal outside the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard. It would take them quite some time to break it.” Mu Chen looked towards Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan as he continued, “They have nearly two hundred people that sealed all the paths towards the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard. If we continue to proceed, we might have to come in contact with the other party. And when it comes to that, the situation might be a little troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you guys still want to continue forth?”</span></p>

He had already expected this reply. With Wen Qingxuan’s pride, how could she retreat and although Luo Li seemed calm and tranquil, she too, had her pride deep in her heart that was not in any way inferior to Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen turned around as his foot tapped on the ground. His figure had stuck to the shadows as he flew away. When Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan saw his actions, they quickly followed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mu Chen and his party left, this area became quiet once again. However, a brief moment later, there was a faint light emitting from the fainted youth’s clothing and with a buzz, it disappeared in a flash of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, in the central area of this forest.</span></p>

At the central area, was an ancient hall. The ancient hall was tightly sealed with light runes faintly flickering outside the hall, sealing the hall like a prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the stone hall, there were dozens of figures. They were Mo Yu, Qin Feng and Liu Xiong, the three leaders of the Academy Alliance were all present in this location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yu stood upfront with a light disc in his hand. Above the light disc, there were rays of light that shot out. Those rays of light were extremely peculiar. When they shone on the light runes outside the stone hall, the light runes were actually dissipating bit by bit, as if snow had encountered lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to this speed, it should take roughly half an hour before the seal is broken.” Qin Feng looked at the constantly dissipating seal as he smiled. However, when he finished speaking, his expression changed. With a wave of his hand, a streak of light shuttled through the forest and landed on his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pitch black unusual insect that had a small body as smooth as a mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Feng frowned his brows as he stared at the insect. Shortly after, he lightly tapped his finger and light appeared on the mirror-like back of the insect. It was a scene that showed three figures, Mu Chen, Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, enemies are indeed, on a narrow road.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Feng looked at the three figures as a cold smile hung on the corner of his mouth. “Seems like these three people are indeed daring. Clearly knowing how unusual this place is and still daring to enter knowing that my Academy Alliance has the advantage in numbers…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up ahead, Mo Yu had his brows furrowed as he watched the scene and spoke with indifference, “I need roughly half an hour’s time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, rest assured. I will not let them reach this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Feng lightly smiled as a chill surged forth in his eyes, “Leave it to me. I’ll teach those three a lesson. Haha, if I had encountered the three of them outside, I really would not dare to do anything to them. However, the heavens have aided me. Entering here, they will understand the meaning of a tiger’s den.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he finished his words, he turned around and left. He waved his hand as dozens of figures flew towards the forest and closely followed him as they quickly disappeared in the shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From Qin Feng’s actions of going all by himself with his men, it seemed that he did not place Mu Chen’s party of three in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let him go alone?” Liu Xiong asked Mo Yu as he looked at the direction that Qin Feng left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yu lightly smiled as he replied, “If it was outside, it would be terrible for Qin Feng to deal with any of those three. But here, the outcome might not be the same. Let him go and you stay to guard me. I can’t split my attention.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.”</span></p>

They will soon understand what a silly decision it was for them to intrude this place so recklessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

Clearly, this was the main path towards the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard with heavy guards of the Academy Alliance.</span></p>

His muscles tensed up as he seemed like a leopard that was about to hunt.</span></p>

All of them had robust figures and also had faint light circulating on the surface of their bodies. Those were all signs that they had trained in the path of physiques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing at the front, there was a towering male, his gaze was like a ferocious tiger that swept around. Clearly, he was the leader among this group.</span></p>

In the next instant, he abruptly raised his head, fixing his gaze onto a direction. Sonic booms from the break of wind resounded as a figure shot out like an arrow from the darkness.</span></p>

The ground cracked as he raised his body a little. A powerful energy surged forth from his body.</span></p>

He had strong confidence with the strength of his physique. Even among the Academy Alliance, only a few could surpass him in terms of physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

In that instant, when his sturdy body had clashed with the black figure, his facial expression changed. That flimsy figure was like a wild breast that specialised in strength. That frightening strength heavily impacted against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a deep groan, that towering male flew out in a terrible state along the ground, drawing long marks as he spurted blood from his mouth.</span></p>

However, that towering male had suffered injuries from a single clash?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they were submerged in astonishment, that figure stabilised, revealing Mu Chen’s flimsy figure as he looked at the towering male. Although that person’s physical body was powerful, it was a pity that he met him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go together!” The towering male quickly barked. He could tell that the youth before him had cultivated his physical body to a frightening extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the overbearing manner of the other party, Mu Chen’s expression turned cold. He inhaled a mouthful of air as black lightning flickered on the surface of his body. Under his muscles, there was thunder that gradually roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

His fist whistled, sweeping out a powerful gale, causing the air to explode from his fist. All those that came in contact with his fist had spurted blood as they flew out without exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan followed. Although their physical bodies weren’t as powerful as Mu Chen’s, they were still more powerful compared to ordinary experts that had cultivated their physical bodies. Adding onto the Luo God Sword in Luo Li’s hands, although they were not able to utilise any Spiritual Energy in this region, the sharpness of the Luo God Sword wasn’t something that could be guarded against with just the physical body alone.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In roughly ten minutes, dozens of experts of the Academy Alliance had already been defeated as they laid on the ground, groaning in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s really a hassle not being able to use Spiritual Energy!” Wen Qingxuan clenched her teeth. If they were outside, those fellows would have fainted with a single palm of her’s without being able to get close to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen laughed and just when he was about to speak, his expression changed as it gradually turned cold. He raised his head, there were figures that slowly walked out not far away. From the looks of it, there were nearly a hundred people that surrounded the entire area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up ahead, Qin Feng slowly walked out with a smile. When he looked at Mu Chen, there were hints of ridicule in his eyes.</span></p>
