 <p><strong>Chapter 389 - Pride of the Upperclassman</strong></p>
 <p>Looking towards the sky, he saw an extremely complicated glowing pattern made of the intertwinement of countless glowing threads. The degree of complication present caused even his eyes turn spirally, while a dizzy feeling erupted within his mind. In the next instant, he quickly turned his vision away as shock and amazement filled his heart. As of now, with his accomplishments in the area of Spiritual Arrays, he was still unable to completely see the rotation of this Spiritual Array! Exactly how strong and complicated was this Spiritual Array?!</p>
 <p>Indeed, Ling Xi was undoubtedly a Spiritual Array Grandmaster. On the accomplishments of Spiritual Arrays, he had quite a big disparity when compared to her.</p>
 <p>“I naturally have no qualms about this method,” said Mu Chen while rubbing his temples and giving a smile. Regardless of the density and power of the Spiritual Energy, those were just external factors. However, if he was able to absorb and refine them, he would be completely relying on himself. This was completely different from the previous method, where he was able to obtain a rapidly increasing strength without doing any work.</p>
 <p>“Let’s begin today. You’ll enter it and start cultivating, while I activate the Spiritual Array. After tearing a hole into the 8th grade Spiritual Array, I’ll siphon some Spiritual Aura out from there.”</p>
 <p>Faintly nodding her head, Ling Xi turned her beautiful eyes towards Mu Chen while saying, “However, whether or not you can break through to Heavenly Completion Stage in the remaining time would have to depend on your hard work.”</p>
 <p>“Yes. I’ll have to trouble you then, Elder Sister Ling Xi.”</p>
 <p>Nodding his head, Mu Chen’s eyes were brimming with resolution and firmness. If he was unable to even force his way into the Heavenly Completion Stage, how could he say to Luo Li that he would be an unrivaled expert, overcoming all obstacles and protecting her with all his might?</p>
 <p>“Let’s begin.”</p>
 <p>Not continuing to delay with any words, Ling Xi extended her jade-like hands, clapping them together. Activating her hand seal, streaks of light shot from within, rushing towards the countless intertwined glowing threads in the sky.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>As a low and deep rumbling sound seemed to ring out across the horizon, dazzling rays of brilliance erupted from the countless glowing threads. In the next instant, the glowing threads converged, transforming into an approximately hundred foot wide glowing vortex in the sky.</p>
 <p>The centre of the vortex headed straight towards nihility, connecting to an unknown place. Extremely vast and boundless Spiritual Energy seemed to be faintly discernable as it spewed out from within like an erupting volcano.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Mu Chen shot straight towards the mountain peak situated below the vortex before taking a seat.</p>
 <p>With a wave of her jade-like hand, the glowing vortex started to furiously revolve about. Amidst the howl resounding about, the worldly Spiritual Aura present within the boundaries of the mountain peak suddenly increased drastically as a spiritual mist rose into the air.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Gorgeous-looking boundless Spiritual Energy appeared within the vortex, pouring down in torrents like a tsunami. Worldly Spiritual Aura fluctuations covered the entire mountain peak, completely shrouding Mu Chen’s body within it.</p>
 <p>Looking at this scene unfurl before her eyes, Ling Xi nodded her head in satisfaction. Turning her lovable face around, she shot a vigilant glance towards the distance. After sensing nothing present there, she gracefully turned around and headed away.</p>
 <p>On a mountain peak in the far distance, Dean Tai Cang and the other Elders could only give a bitter laugh as they observed the commotion happening in their view.</p>
 <p>“This Ling Xi is actually able to siphon some of the Spiritual Aura from within that 8th grade Spiritual Array…” said Hall Master Mo You in shock and astonishment as he smacked his lips. This 8th grade Spiritual Array was the lifeblood of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. During the creation of the academy, their Lord Northern Sea Dragon had paid an enormous price to hire an extremely powerful and mysterious influence from the Great Thousand World to create it. However, he never imagined that a Spiritual Array of such a degree would have a slit ripped open by Ling Xi. She’s truly formidable.</p>
 <p>“It’s alright.”</p>
 <p>Dean Tai Cang said with a hearty chuckle. Not caring that Ling Xi had her attention set on their most important 8th grade Spiritual Array of their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, he stared at the glowing Spiritual Energy pillar pouring down like a waterfall with his hands crossed behind his back. “Next up, let me truly see, exactly, if Mu Chen’s able to rely on himself to completely break through in the last half a month…” he muttered.</p>
 <p>If Mu Chen was truly able to accomplish that, then their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy had truly produced a rarely seen monstrous talent.</p>
 <p>The commotion that Ling Xi caused wasn’t small, since the boundless glowing Spiritual Energy pillar descending from the sky appeared was exceedingly eye-catching within the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Therefore, for the next few periods of time, there were quite a few students who paid attention to this strange phenomena, causing unavoidable shock and amazement within the student body.</p>
 <p>However, their shock and astonishment didn’t last long, since the reason behind this matter gradually surfaced. As that news was spread around, amazed and astonishment filled the eyes of many as they thought, <em>Mu Chen actually wanted to rely on this to rush to Heavenly Completion Stage?</em></p>
 <p><em>That fellow was truly abnormal!</em></p>
 <p>Countless students exclaimed in astonishment as they heard the news. Mu Chen had arrived in their Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy only a year ago. However, his progress was sufficient to cause those senior students to feel inferior and ashamed at their own progress. Nevertheless, after recapping that even a vicious person like Mo Longzi had suffered a beating in Mu Chen’s hands, they knew that this fellow simply couldn’t be seen through a normal perspective. Why would they need to compare with such an abnormal human? Thinking along this path, they felt much more relieved within their hearts.</p>
 <p>In this world, there’s always some people that were out of the ordinary.</p>
 <p>At a mountain peak within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Li Xuantong was staring at the gigantic glowing Spiritual Energy pillar in the far distance. After a long while, he turned his vision towards the Freshman region. At that area was a girl that he was completely unable to remove from his mind. Nevertheless, he knew that he might never, ever be able to see the lovable appearance that naturally came out of her heart that she revealed in front of Mu Chen, for his sake…</p>
 <p>A sliver of complicated emotions flashed across Li Xuantong’s handsome face. The youth that he had doubted and questioned at the beginning had progressed at such a rapid pace, even exceeding him now. All of this proved the keenness and accuracy of the girl’s vision. No matter how extraordinary and outstanding she was, even after everyone had doubted and questioned her choice of liking that person, she still stuck to her beliefs.</p>
 <p>Li Xuantong was undeniably arrogant and proud of himself. There was no need to question his talent. On a certain perspective, Mu Chen could be considered his love rival. However, this didn’t stop Li Xuantong from denying the recognition Mu Chen had achieved from his accomplishments. Indeed, this youth possessed the potential to make Luo Li fall in love with him. Nevertheless, the feeling of being surpassed and overtaken was truly hard to stomach.</p>
 <p>“Haha, looks like we, the two Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy brothers of the same boat, are about to be overtaken.” A laughing voice suddenly rang out from behind him. Turning around, Li Xuantong noticed Shen Cangsheng sitting on a large cliff behind his back. On the sole aspect of appearance, Shen Cangsheng might not be as dashing as Li Xuantong, and not as handsome as Mu Chen. However, he possessed a bearing that was solely his. That tall and straight posture appeared akin to a divine spear that could pierce through the confines of heavens, forever unable to be bent. The disdainful look present on his face wasn’t brash or insolent, making people feel an enchanting and imposing aura radiating from him.</p>
 <p>Shen Cangsheng possessed extremely strong prestige and popularity within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Even with Mu Chen’s strong awe and fame rushing throughout the entire academy due him defeating Mo Longzi, it wasn’t able to suppress the prestige of the Heavenly Rankings’ Overlord. This wasn’t due to the reason of people, but that Shen Cangsheng was an extremely charismatic person.</p>
 <p>Heading towards the stone cliff and sitting down, Li Xuantong faintly spoke out, “What’s the matter? Is the Overlord of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Heavenly Rankings feeling dispirited? That’s not like you.”</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen truly is an extremely formidable fellow.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the glowing Spiritual Energy pillar in the far distance, Shen Cangsheng replied, “From the establishment of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy till now, people who were able to achieve such accomplishments within the first year of entering the academy would not exceed more than the number of our fingers. After thinking, the most recent person seemed to exist a hundred years ago. I still remember his name, Qin Zhantian. During the Great Spiritual Academy Competition that year, countless geniuses from various great spiritual academies were overshadowed under his feet. Even the Divine Sons of the Saint Spiritual Academy that year had suffered defeat in his hands. Under his spear, he swept away anyone in his path, being undefeatable and invincible!”</p>
 <p>“That time can be considered as the most uplifting and proud moment within the past hundred years of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s history!”</p>
 <p>“Senior Brother Qin Zhantian, huh?” Li Xuantong said in a soft voice, “I’ve heard that he seems to be a regional Overlord in the Great Thousand Worlds, possessing heaven-transcending power.”</p>
 <p>Fanaticism was faintly present within Shen Cangsheng’s eyes as he spoke out with a smile, “He’s my goal. When I’ve entered the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, I’ve already said that I want to be the same as him!”</p>
 <p>“Therefore,” looking towards Li Xuantong, a grin cracked open from Shen Cangsheng’s mouth, while a disdainful and haughty look erupted from his eyes once again.</p>
 <p>“I’ll send my application to the Dean to let me enter the Door of the Northern Depths to train and cultivate!”</p>
 <p>Faint shock immediately shook through Li Xuantong’s heart. Looking towards Shen Cangsheng, he spoke out, “The Door of the Northern Depths? Isn’t that the place that turned students crazy due to being unable to handle the pressure from within?”</p>
 <p>That place could be considered as a terrifying place that would cause the faces of the people in the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to change when mentioned. That year, there were outstanding students who had entered it. However, in the end, due to being unable to handle the pressure within that place, they suffered mental damage, resulting in them turning crazy, leading to the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy to shut it down. After that, it was rarely ever opened again. However, seemingly due to this reason, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy was hard pressed to achieve any good results in the following Great Spiritual Academy Competitions.</p>
 <p>Now, Shen Cangsheng actually wanted to go in there to train and cultivate?</p>
 <p>With a smile, Shen Cangsheng smiled and continued talking. “If I’m scared and afraid by just this, how can I even talk about something like surpassing Senior Brother Qin Zhantian? Li Xuantong, I really want to participate in the Great Spiritual Academy Competition, and compete with those geniuses and monstrous talents from the various great spiritual academies. What about you? Are you going to continue in this lukewarm state, and wait for Mu Chen to overtake you?”</p>
 <p>Instantly, Li Xuantong turned quiet. After a while, placing his hand behind his head, he looked towards the glowing Spiritual Energy pillar in the far distance, while the gaze within his eyes slowly grew swift and fierce.</p>
 <p>“Door of the Northern Depths? Very well! I also really want to see exactly how frightening that place is! Since you dare to enter that place, why can’t I do the same? You still don’t have the ability to force me to be your number two for eternity, Shen Cangsheng! What’s more, how can I let Mu Chen show his might alone at the Great Spiritual Academy Competition?”</p>
 <p>“Haha! Well said!”</p>
 <p>Standing up, Shen Cangsheng gave a heroic and hearty laugh.</p>
 <p>“When we leave the Door of the Northern Depths, let’s dish a beating out to that little brat Mu Chen. Although he had saved us, we’ve to let him know that surpassing your Seniors isn’t an easy task!”</p>
