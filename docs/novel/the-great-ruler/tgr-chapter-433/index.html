 <p><strong>Chapter 433 - Jet-Black Space</strong></p>
 <p>“How long are you going to hide that Bloodline of Sin?!”</p>
 <p>Within the jet-black space, the old, withered face that had appeared from the folds of space angrily stared at the white-robed figure, his furious voice rumbling out, shaking and reverberating the entire space.</p>
 <p>That white-robed lady was naturally Mu Chen’s mother. At this moment, she shot a cold look at the old, withered face before replying in an indifferent tone, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
 <p>“Qing Yanjing, do still want to be that stubborn? Do you think that after allowing a little girl that had no bloodline relationship with you, and letting her train and cultivate the Yin scroll of the Pagoda Spiritual Art, that you will be able to fool and deceive us?” replied the old, withered face in a stern voice.</p>
 <p>Hearing that, a cold expression flashed within Aunt Jing’s eyes as she growled out towards the old, withered face, “I did not use Ling Xi to fool or deceive anyone, and I’ve never said that Ling Xi had any bloodline relationship to me. It’s just that you bunch of stubborn and obstinate old fellows are too stupid. That’s why you all will feel suspicious.”</p>
 <p>“You’ve lent the Yin scroll of the Pagoda Spiritual Art out to let her train and cultivate for the sake of obscuring our attention, right? You’re really trying to protect that Bloodline of Sin, right?!” The old, withered face continued to furiously roar out.</p>
 <p>“Training and cultivating the Yin scroll of the Pagoda Spiritual Art was Ling Xi’s own decision. I didn’t force her or interfere in any way. I really didn’t think much about it when I initially brought her back here. The only thing I thought was that she was pitiful and thus was showing some compassion. However, who would have thought that you old fellows would panic and treat everyone as your enemy. You can’t even let go of an innocent little girl!” replied Aunt Jing with a sneer.</p>
 <p>“The Divine Meridians in your body has clearly been separated! That Bloodline of Sin has got it for sure! You definitely installed a seal in his body, right? That’s why we’re unable to find him even after searching for all these years, right?!”</p>
 <p>“Qing Yanjing, being the Saintress of our clan, you have an extraordinary position with astonishing talent. Placed within the Great Thousand Worlds and the thousands and thousands of clans, only you can match up to ‘Mo Hetian’ of the ‘Maha Clan’, who are one of the Ancient God clans like us. If the two of you were to get together, not only will it be extremely beneficial for our two clans, there’s a possibility of ‘Mo Hetian’ breaking through the worldly laws and becoming the controller of the universe. At that time, you’ll become our queen!”</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, the old, withered face turned incomparably furious, with his retort seemingly turning into howls. “However, not only did you fall in love with some ant from some place in your real world training, you</p>
 <p>even damaged your own Divine Meridians and gave birth to a Bloodline of Sin! Exactly where have you thrown the long inheritance of our clan to?!”</p>
 <p>“What does that ant have that’s worth your love? Could it be that he’s better than Mo Hetian? He’s the true king! In his hands, the Maha Clan has returned to its former splendor! As for you, you could have also achieved such a step, and yet you went to do such a thing! How can you let down the care and nurture our clan has provided for you?”</p>
 <p>A slight wrinkle appeared on the forehead of Aunt Jing as she replied, “Although Mo Hetian’s formidable, does that mean I have to like him? Great Elder, it looks like you all have rotted away for too long. Anything within your eye might be only ranked on how to increase the strength of our clan. Therefore, you all don’t know the feeling known as love.”</p>
 <p>“Qing Yanjing! Do you understand the significance of the existence of our clan? Do you know the significance of our clan for the Great Thousand Worlds? How can such a selfish thing as love appear in our clan?!” roared the old, withered face.</p>
 <p>“Great Elder, indeed, our clan of the past was also my pride. However, you all have sunk too much into this pride and arrogance. This will only let you all become complacent. Let me ask you, before our clan had that pride and arrogance, what were we like? Were there such rules that you’ve just spoke of, Great Elder?” asked Aunt Jing in an indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>Within the jet-black space, the old, withered face turned silent awhile, before speaking out in a deep voice, “Looks like you’ve truly let that so-called ‘love’ overtake your mind to actually dare to question the pride of our clan.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his reply, Aunt Jing faintly shook her head. Indeed, it's a waste of time to explain stuff like emotions to this old fool.</p>
 <p>“Although you are continuing to protect that Bloodline of Sin, I don’t believe that you can protect him for an entire lifetime from us! Once we find him, we’ll definitely capture him and strip him of the Divine Meridians! Although the bloodline of our clan flows within him, due to his father being too petty and vulgar, it has led to the corruption of the pure bloodline! Therefore, our clan will not recognize him! Towards such existences, the only thing we’ll do is exterminate it!” said the old, withered face slowly.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Just as his voice rang out, all of a sudden, an ice-cold expression blanketed the face of Aunt Jing sitting within the jet-black darkness. In the next instant, an imposing aura that blotted the skies swept out, causing intense shaking to appear in this jet-black space, with signs of collapse starting to form.</p>
 <p>“Qing Yanjing, do really want to rebel against the clan’s rules?!” Sensing this change, the Great Elder instantly roared out in fury.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Aunt Jing suppressed the imposing aura that had blotted the skies. Turning her ice-cold gaze towards the old, withered face, she spoke one word at a time. “Great Elder, although I’ve willingly accepted the punishment over the past years, I hope that you all understand why I’m doing this. This doesn’t mean that I’m afraid of you all, as I hope that our clan won’t suffer any losses due to me. However, if you all truly dare to hurt my child’s life, don’t blame me for not showing any mercy. At that time, even if you all can kill me, I’ll make sure that your lives won’t be too good, either. At the very least, Great Elder, I can definitely say that I’ll absolutely make sure you fall with me!”</p>
 <p>“You’re too brazen, Qing Yanjing!”</p>
 <p>A furious roar rang out from the Great Elder as green veins seemed to squirm on the old, withered face. At the same time, a frightening aura swept out, causing the jet-black space to crazily tremble.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, no fear or dread was present on Aunt Jing’s face as she continued to coldly stare at the Great Elder.</p>
 <p>Humm.</p>
 <p>As the furious roar of the Great Elder rang out, ripples started to from within this jet-black space once again as numerous old, withered faces surfaced out,with varying expressions on them.</p>
 <p>“Great Elder, please calm down.”</p>
 <p>“You too, little Jing. What’s the point of antagonizing the Great Elder?”</p>
 <p>As those giant faces surfaced, voices started to ring out towards the two initial parties present.</p>
 <p>“Elders, I’ve done nothing to provoke him. It’s just that some of those rotten rules have to be changed. Was the bloodline of our clan as noble as you all have assumed since the beginning? Didn’t our ancestor break free from the confines of ordinary people, temper himself and train bitterly to stand at the peak of the universe?”</p>
 <p>Aunt Jing continued speaking with an indifferent tone. “Then, why do we have to look down on them? Why can’t my child be more outstanding than me?”</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Do you know how much our clan had invested for your current accomplishments? Without your help, that Bloodline of Sin would not have the faintest bit of background. What can it achieve? The Divine Meridian in it’s body’s simply a waste!” The Great Elder replied with a snort.</p>
 <p>“Within the Great Thousand Worlds, there are too many peaks experts to count. Among them, there are a few well-known figures who had low backgrounds, with some even coming from the Lower Realms. Did they ever have any background at all? Nevertheless, didn’t they make their name spread illustriously across the Great Thousand Worlds? As for that astonishing Mo Hetian that you’ve hung in your mouths, didn’t he also get forced to retreat by the Flame Emperor when he had tried to attack the Endless Fire Territory? Within the Great Thousand Worlds, other than the Flame Emperor, there’s still the Martial Realm’s Martial Emperor, Sword City’s Green Shirt Sword Saint, Undying Ground’s Gravekeeper…” a calm expression hung on Aunt Jing’s face as she spoke out. Each of the names she had mentioned had widespread fame and reputation within the Great Thousand Worlds. As they rang out from her mouth, they reverberated within this jet black space.</p>
 <p>“From the beginning, did those peak experts possess any strong or powerful background? No. The only thing they had was the heart of an expert. Its that heart that they were able to spread their illustrious names far and wide in the Great Thousand Worlds. Therefore, Great Elder, if you truly assume that to be a genuine expert, one would need to completely rely on nurturing and resources, then I’m afraid that you’re sorely mistaken.” Aunt Jing continued talking with an indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>Faint fluctuations appeared on the old, withered face of the Great Elder present in the folds of this jet-black space. Feeling angered once again, he tried to rebuke her, but no words were able to leave his mouth. In the end, with a cold snort, he replied, “No matter how much you argue and scheme, you are unable to overturn the decision of the Elder Council.”</p>
 <p>Faintly closing her eyes, Aunt Jing replied, “What you all decide is your business, not mine. Similarly, what I choose is my business, not yours. I still have deep feeling for our clan. However, if it truly goes to that stage…”</p>
 <p>At this moment, no words came out of her mouth as she slowly closed her eyes, not wanting to speak anymore. Clearly, she didn’t plan to continue chatting with those rotten old freaks.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the Great Elder could only give an irritated snort as a reply. In the next moment, those gigantic, withered faces started to disappear from this jet-black space.</p>
 <p>Following their disappearance, Aunt Jing opened her eyes. Tightly clenching her hands, she gave a soft sigh. She knew that relying purely on her words would absolutely be unable to shake those old fellows, who had rotten down to their bones. They’ll definitely continue to search for Mu Chen’s traces. However, the words she had said earlier should have caused some shock in those old fellows; after all, she wasn’t someone without the strength to kill a chicken. With her strength, she was considered within the top half within the clan. If anything happened to her, it would be a gigantic loss for the clan.</p>
 <p>An expert of her level could not be nurtured just by relying on the so-called “resources”.</p>
 <p>Therefore, they should not dare to force her too much. This way, it would give Mu Chen quite a bit of time, whom she was confident in. If Mu Chen had become an ordinary person and stayed quietly in the Northern Spiritual Realm, she would also be gratified at that. After all, being a mother, all she wanted was for Mu Chen to be safe.</p>
 <p>However, the current Mu Chen had clearly walked on another path. The youth had already grown tall and straight, no longer the crying infant in swaddling clothes. Ever since he was little, he had walked out of the Northern Spiritual Realm and entered one of the five Great Academies, the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Furthermore, she could tell that Mu Chen was extremely outstanding, rapidly progressing in strength as he unleashed his potential. There’s a possibility that his future path might be even more outstanding than his mother’s. Although some Elders didn’t believe in that, she, on the other hand, had a deep, unwavering belief in it.</p>
 <p>Towards Mu Chen, who had chosen to walk on this path, although she felt pain and lamented in her heart, she also felt a sliver of pride. Her child was extraordinary. One day, those doubtful gazes will all be shocked and astounded by him.</p>
 <p>However, this needed time.</p>
 <p>A genuine expert needed time to be shaped and tempered. The moment he completed his refinement would be the moment where he dazzles the eyes of the Great Thousand Worlds where outstanding people vie for supremacy.</p>
 <p>Tightly clenching her hands together, the gaze coming from Aunt Jing gradually turned warm and gentle, while a low murmur slowly rang out within that jet-black space.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen, since you’ve decided to walk this path, Mom will support you with all my heart. Mom will wait here for the moment where your name will move the entire Great Thousand Worlds!”</p>
