 <p><b>Chapter 140 – Changes inside Body</b></p>
 <p><span style>Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sounds of winds being cleaved through could be heard resounding throughout the mountains. Beams of light flashed as numerous figures stormed through the area. At the same time, numerous shouts could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the flock of men was Mu Chen, currently wearing a gloomy expression. </span><i><span style>These bastards had already chased him for almost an entire day, yet they didn’t show the slightest signs of stopping.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover as the chase continued, the people following him had increased. The attractiveness of the two Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences was too great. But most importantly, Mu Chen only appeared to be at the Spirit Stage Initial Phase. As such, his currently perceived level wasn’t enough to make the ones that were at a slightly higher or even the same level to fear him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His perceived weakness caused everybody to want to catch him and seize the Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must think of a plan to get rid of them.” Mu Chen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Mu Chen was pondering his problems, the sound of a sudden explosion &nbsp;came from inside his body. A vibration instantly spread throughout his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puchi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sudden vibration caused Mu Chen to shudder in surprise. His face immediately turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. At the same time, his figure staggered a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, he won’t be able to last much longer, capture him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let him escape!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Far behind Mu Chen, the flock of men witnessed this scene and were completely delighted. Mu Chen’s stubborness and speed were much higher than they had anticipated. Even after they chased him for nearly a day, they failed to surround him. Judging from his current appearance, it seemed likely that Mu Chen couldn’t hold on any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of dismay flashed through Mu Chen’s eyes. He immediately concentrated and reached into his aura sea. Once he entered the aura sea, he discovered a formidable Spiritual Energy fluctuation that was spreading out like ripples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the source of this Spiritual Energy was the Nine Netherbird that was inside the mandala flower cage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the Nine Netherbird’s body had doubled in size and its body was covered in black flames. Its eyes betrayed the pain of its current struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell are you doing?!” Mu Chen shouted out. This damn bird, it had actually secretly absorbed the two Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences, and now it even caused this mess? It was truly trying to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Nine Netherbird had been lying down on the mandala flower, a tinge of icy-blue and fiery-red appeared in its black flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen immediately understood what was happening. The Nine Netherbird had eaten too much. It had attempted to ingest two Heaven Rank Spiritual Beasts’ Soul Essences at once, but a backlash had occurred. After all, it had still been in an extremely weakened state. If he was being honest, he had to say that the Nine Netherbird’s injuries were far more severe than those the Mysterious Spirithail Dragon had sustained earlier. If it had ingested the Soul Essences one by one, perhaps it wouldn’t have been a problem. However, it had been extremely greedy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mysterious Spirithail Dragon and the Geocentric Flame Jalapura were known for controlling the powers of great blizzards and rushing magma respectively. The nature of these two elements naturally opposed each other. Right now, the Nine Netherbird had placed them together. This caused the resistance to sharply increase, which led to the backlash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You deserve it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen scolded. </span><i><span style>The damn bird had finally gotten what it deserved.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, scolding aside, he was quite anxious as well. After all, the Nine Netherbird was inside his aura sea. If another backlash occurred, the explosion would probably destroy him instantly. Therefore, he could not afford to do nothing in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I do?” Mu Chen asked helplessly. He was extremely unfortunate. Right now, he was being hunted by others. Now an accident occurred inside his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ingest them!” The Nine Netherbird sent its painful thoughts over to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must get rid of the pursuers temporarily. So no matter how much pain you’re in, you must help me now. Otherwise, we’ll both be dead!” Mu Chen gritted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, he immediately left his aura sea. Then, he turned around and noticed that the men chasing after him had already covered quite a bit of the distance that had initially been separating them. He took a deep breath and felt a powerful energy surging out of his aura sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dong Dong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When this energy emerged, Mu Chen was able to feel a slight disturbance within his aura sea. It was evident that the Nine Netherbird’s condition got worse due to it sending part of its power over to Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment, neither had the time to care much about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, black flames gushed out of Mu Chen’s body. Then, a pair of black flame wings formed on his back. The air instantly exploded as he turned into a black beam of light. With unimaginable speed, he disappeared into the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they watched this scene occur in front of their very eyes, the faces of the people chasing after Mu Chen immediately turned pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase. We’ll chase after him using the residual Spiritual Energy fluctuations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He must be desperate right now. As long as we catch up to him, he will not be able to escape!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous shouts rang out. They immediately increased the circulation of Spiritual Energy inside their bodies and accelerated as they continued their chase…</span></p>
 <p><span style>By relying on the Nine Netherbird’s power, Mu Chen was able to escape the flock of men in a few minutes. He immediately entered a group of mountains and descended near a waterfall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Mu Chen landed on the ground, he immediately sat cross-legged. He had to manage his time well. Although he had been able to escape the mob temporarily, he had left traces of Spiritual Energy along the way. Since he didn’t have time to erase them, it was only a matter of time before they caught up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s thoughts quickly entered his aura sea again and noticed that the black flames on the Nine Netherbird was showing signs of distorting. Its body was constantly expanding and contracting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the appearance of Spiritual Energy being in a completely unstable state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s thoughts quickly entered the tiny spirit body that was sitting on top of the Spiritual Energy light wheel. Then, the little body rushed out and appeared in front of the mandala flower. His hands changed forms and Spiritual Energy shot out. However, he became stunned when he noticed that his Spiritual Energy completely shattered once it made contact with the Nine Netherbird’s chaotic and violent Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen was startled. He smiled bitterly when he discovered that it would be impossible for him to help with the mere strength of a Spirit Stage Initial Phase. Not only did the Nine Netherbird have its own Spiritual Energy, it also possessed the Soul Essence of the Mysterious Spirithail Dragon and the Geocentric Flame Jalapura. There was nothing he could do now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thought was conveyed to him by the Nine Netherbird.“Use the mandala flower! Did you truly believe that you could had helped with your strength being only at Spirit Stage Initial Phase?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I could activate this thing, did you think that I would have let you act so arrogantly in front of me?” Mu Chen shouted in anger. If he had been able to activate the mandala flower, he would have completely ingested the Nine Netherbird in the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was utterly furious, Mu Chen still managed to calm himself down. His spirit slowly descended and landed near the mandala flower. He hesitated for a moment before extending a blurry hand made of light, and gently touched the cage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he made contact with the mandala flower, Mu Chen discovered that his spirit was able to fuse with the mandala flower without any obstruction. Immediately after he had discovered that, obscure fluctuations surged into his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made Mu Chen feel something unique. He had a feeling that the mandala flower that emerged from the mysterious black paper had some intelligence of its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you help me out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen knew that he could not control this mysterious mandala flower right now. Therefore, he sent his thoughts over to see if they would have any effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Mu Chen sent these thoughts over, the mandala flower actually started emitting brilliant purple lights. The beautiful and enchanting petals also blossomed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A golden magical engraving seemed to emerge on the petal. Then, these engravings shot out like a purple golden web and completely enveloped the Nine Netherbird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chi Chi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the purple golden web enveloped the Nine Netherbird, smoke erupted from the Nine Netherbird’s body. Its body struggled violently and it sent an angry thought over: “What the hell are you doing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it detected that that the two Soul Essences were also in pain while being constricted by the web, the Nine Netherbird was also suppressed by it. It was as if the mandala flower planned on eliminating all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How should I know!” Mu Chen was also shocked by the scene that was occurring. He had no way of controlling the mandala flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t hurt it!” Mu Chen gnashed his teeth and quickly sent a new thought to the mandala flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he quickly discovered that this thought of his played no effect. Although the mandala flower had a bit of intelligence, it did not have any wisdom. Since Mu Chen asked for it to help him, it felt that it had to eliminate anything that could harm him. Since the two Soul Essence had been ingested by the Nine Netherbird, it planned on eliminating the Nine Netherbird along with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and spit out the Soul Essences! Otherwise, you’ll be eliminated as well!” Mu Chen quickly thought of this point and shouted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Their Spiritual Energy has already been fused into my body. How can I spit them out?!” The Nine Netherbird responded furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” At this moment, even with Mu Chen’s temper, he had the impulse to curse furiously. </span><i><span style>Did this damn bird have to be this impatient?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sooner or later, I’ll be killed by you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen gnashed his teeth and moved his body. His spirit directly entered the mandala flower and appeared on the back of the Nine Netherbird. His hands touched the purple golden web and tried to remove it. After all, he was the owner of this body, and if that was the case, the mandala flower probably wouldn’t hurt him, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird was shocked by Mu Chen’s action. A hint of complexion flashed through its eyes. </span><i><span style>This idiot. Why is he this stupid? How could he charge in before figuring whether or not the purple golden web would hurt him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When the purple golden web touched Mu Chen’s body, it shuddered for a moment. Then, it directly phased through Mu Chen’s tiny spirit form and continued to suppress the Nine Netherbird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s completely ignoring me.” Mu Chen touched his unscathed body and said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s planning to eliminate anything that could be a threat to you.” The Nine Netherbird actually turned calm. It stopped struggling and allowed the purple golden web to suppress it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really deserve it!” Mu Chen cursed. This guy truly only had itself to blame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare curse at me!” The Nine Netherbird was completely furious. It flapped its burning wings and directly sent Mu Chen flying away from its back. However, it was evident that it did not use much strength and Mu Chen landed gently in front of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Mu Chen landed in front of the Nine Netherbird, he asked helplessly: “What should we do then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird glanced at him and became silent. It said: “It’s not like there isn’t a way. It’s only attacking me because it recognizes that I am a threat to you. If I’m not a threat to you, it will probably stop its attack.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Threat?” Mu Chen was stunned. He bitterly replied: “Then, could it be that I must ingest you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dream on. The Nine Netherbird possesses the bloodline of the ancient Undying Bird. Even if it’s a destroyed Soul Essence, we will never let a human ingest it. We would never let them control us!” The Nine Netherbird shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen let out a hollow laugh and responded: “I was only joking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Netherbird stared fiercely at Mu Chen and became silent again. After a while, it finally spoke in a somewhat difficult voice: “Aside from ingesting me, there is actually another way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Mu Chen hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of struggle flashed through the Nine Netherbird’s eyes. Then, as if it had made a major decision, it slowly closed its eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bloodline Bond.”</span></p>
