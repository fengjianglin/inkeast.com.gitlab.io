 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the sparkling and glittering lake quietly sat a silhouette, hovering above the lake like a piece of wood that the ripples on the surface of the lake weren’t able to shake his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was naturally Mu Chen, who had chosen to quietly cultivate above the Treasure Lake. This place was filled with Spiritual Energy; furthermore, it was tranquil and peaceful without any disturbances from the deathly aura. Thus, it was an extremely good spot for secluded cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around the lake, Nine Nether, Mo Feng and the rest were also cultivating. They had just obtained Quasi-Saint Artifacts, so they had to nurture them with their Spiritual Energy so that they would be able to command them more fluently, raising their fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they were all highly supportive of Mu Chen’s suggestion to meditate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his meditation, Mu Chen opened his eyes and his black pupils seemed like a deep pond without any fluctuation. He briefly pondered before retrieving a jade bottle and flicked his finger. A current whistled out of the jade bottle and the Spiritual Energy in the heavens and earth boiled along with it. Vaguely, there was a mist of Spiritual Energy enveloping Mu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current was naturally made of tens of thousands of drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivation of Sovereign experts would generally not be able to part with the importance of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. That was the fundamental resources that all Sovereign experts required. As long as they had a sufficient amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, then their cultivation would have twice the effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid coiled around Mu Chen and roughly looking at it, the amount was at least in the millions. Mu Chen closed his eyes and slightly opened his mouth, then gently breathed in. Immediately, the current that was made of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid started to form into a long dragon, then it whistled forth and entered his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surface of Mu Chen’s body flickered with dazzling spiritual light as he circulated his cultivation technique to refine the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid before pouring them into his Sovereign Sea and improving his own Spiritual Energy cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, time quietly flowed as Mu Chen devoured Sovereign Spiritual Liquid akin to a whale as he cultivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he cultivated, time flowed like sand and before he knew it, nearly ten days have passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over those ten days, Mu Chen had been practically doing nothing but absorbing the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid and he had already spent 5,000,000 Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, clearing more than half of what he had obtained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen’s cultivation had also improved along with the exhaustion of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid. His Spiritual Energy had slowly stepped into the pinnacle level of the Sixth Grade Sovereign Realm. He was only a step away from breaking into the Seventh Grade Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Mu Chen feel pity was the feeling of breaking through to Seventh Grade Sovereign still hadn’t appeared. It appears that he would have to seek another path to break through to the Seventh Grade Sovereign Realm for the time being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Mu Chen had also used the Life-Extinguishing Pupil’s probing ability during the ten days of his cultivation and explored around the massive Myriad Beast Graveyard, in an attempt to search for traces of the Undying Bird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was disappointed that there weren’t any results in his search.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Myriad Beast Graveyard was too massive, filled with a deathly aura that blocked out the senses. Even with the Life-Extinguishing Pupil, he could only roughly search around and it was tough to get a distinct perception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen was clearly not willing to give up despite the failures, since he had already made a resolution when he entered the Divine Beast Origin to help Nine Nether perfect her bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the failures weren’t able to waver his determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the massive lake, Mu Chen opened his eyes from his cultivation state, since the massive river of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid had already been reduced to a strand of Spiritual Energy mist that was burrowing into his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A light flashed in his black pupils, before his figure moved and appeared in the sky. Blacklight appeared from the centre of his brows and a vertical eye opened with mystery emitting from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black light looked like it could pierce through the endless space and myriad miles in radius was captured in the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had used the power of the Life-Extinguishing Pupil once again in an attempt to find clues of the Undying Bird in the Myriad Beast Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black light had pierced through space and every single inch of this region that was filled with a deathly aura had been searched by him, since there were also limits to the Life-Extinguishing Pupil. Further regions would be more blurred whenever he tried to investigate them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During those ten days, Mu Chen had practically searched the nearby regions, before his perception gradually went deeper into the Myriad Beast Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The deathly aura in those regions was too severe, even with the Life-Extinguishing Pupil, thus he was still having difficulty probing around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half an hour swiftly passed under his investigation but Mu Chen was a little disappointed, since he still did not find any clues of the Undying Bird this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus his brows were tightly knitted together. He never expected that it would be this difficult to obtain clues of the Undying Bird. Han Shan had previously talked about the Undying Flames, but he had not even seen a spark of them until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if it wasn’t for his trust of Han Shan’s character, he would have already doubted whether that fellow was lying to him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the investigation continued, Mu Chen felt a little pain coming from the centre of his brows. It was because he had been using the Life-Extinguishing Pupil for too long, thus it was showing his limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing the stinging pain, Mu Chen helplessly shook his head and was about to call off the search.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just as he had that thought, his eyes suddenly contracted with black light flickering in the centre of his brows, shining into the depths of this Myriad Beast Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The location that the black light had illuminated was pitch-black. If Mu Chen could see the other regions, although they might be somewhat blurred, then the reason this region was pitch-black was that something was hiding it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This place is odd…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen pondered and he immediately activated the Life-Extinguishing Pupil. A black light gathered in his eyes and he tried to look through the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when the black light tried to look through the darkness, space seemed to fluctuate. Vaguely, there was a violent and fearsome roar that resounded from it. At the same time, flames incinerated space along with extremely terrifying fluctuations that had instantly dissipated the sight of the Life-Extinguishing Pupil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s body jolted and a trace of blood flowed from the Life-Extinguishing Pupil at the centre of his brows. Evidently, he had suffered an attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face had turned extremely grave. The dark area was actually so terrifying to the point that he would suffer an attack when the Life-Extinguishing Pupil tried to get a brief look at it. Fortunately, he did not use his full power and recklessly charged in. Otherwise, even the Life-Extinguishing Pupil might be heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that region?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen knitted his brows with a grave expression. Generally, such similar regions were definitely not ordinary places and it might be those where powerful existences have fallen, thus the area was protected by their aura.</span></p>

It was the first time he had suffered such a terrifying attack. There must definitely be something terrifying residing within there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The flames from before… they seem somewhat familiar. Could that have been the Undying Flames?” Mu Chen muttered to himself. Weren’t those the Undying Flames when he suffered an attack to the Life-Extinguishing Pupil?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that terrifying roar didn’t seem to belong to the Undying Bird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That region was truly bizarre and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze flickered, before the Life Extinguishing Pupil slowly recovered. He activated it once more, but this time, he did not try to look through the darkness. He was examining the surrounding areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those areas were filled with terrifying deathly aura and he could vaguely sense some terrifying fluctuations of deathly aura that must be from powerful Beast Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This should be in the depths of the Myriad Beast Graveyard, it’s no wonder why there are so many powerful Beast Spirits guarding it…” Mu Chen murmured to himself. After a rough investigation, the surrounding areas were surrounded with layers of powerful Beast Spirits, making it tough for them to get in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen was investigating that area, he suddenly exclaimed upon seeing a group of people swiftly travelling through the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their direction was evidently the darkness region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, what made Mu Chen even more startled was that there were a couple of familiar silhouettes that he recognised. Within that group, there was a male and female, Chi Hongwu and Bai Bin, whom he had previously met in the free market.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Phoenix Clan?” Mu Chen’s gaze flickered. Those silhouettes were surrounded with powerful Spiritual Energy fluctuations and all of them turned out to be from the Phoenix Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze shifted towards the front of that group. The person leading seemed to be the leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was dressed in blue clothes and had an indifferent expression on his face, along with an extremely cold aura surrounding him. In his path, even space had been frozen into ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stared at that person and felt stinging pain all over his skin. It was a sign that he had felt a threat to his physical body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Mu Chen was looking at that blue-clothed man, that person suddenly trembled, then he stopped before he abruptly raised his head and coldly looked into the space before him. It’s as if he had sensed Mu Chen’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person coldly snorted, then he clenched his hand and a fan appeared. The fan was ice-blue in colour. It seemed to have been made from the phoenix’s feathers and white flames were blazing on it. Those flames weren’t hot; on the contrary, they emitted an extremely terrifying chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He held onto the fan and fanned towards the space. White flames rolled out and the atmosphere in this region had been instantly turned to ice as they spread out, completely freezing this space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When space froze, the black light from Mu Chen’s Life-Extinguishing Pupil was being corroded by the cold before it dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above the sky of the Treasure Lake, Mu Chen opened his eyes and the Life-Extinguishing Pupil on his forehead slowly disappeared. In his black pupils, a bizarre light flashed as he looked towards that direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That blue-clothed man should be from the Phoenix Clan… but why are they going to that dark region?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That white-feathered fan should be a Quasi-Saint Artifact. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be able to obstruct the view of the Life Extinguishing Pupil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is somewhat odd…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze flashed as he muttered with curiosity for that mysterious region rising in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Phoenix Clan would not move without profits, and their eyesight was extremely aloof. So ordinary things wouldn’t be able to attract their attention. But right now, for them to be travelling in such rush must mean that there had to be something extraordinary in that darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the extraordinary thing might be the… Undying Bird.</span></p>
