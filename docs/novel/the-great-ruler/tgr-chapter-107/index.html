 <p><b>Chapter 107 – Exterminate</b></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it illuminated the sky with a black light, the massive and mysterious black lotus soared through the sky at an alarming speed and emerged above Liu Jingshan, who was still transformed into the Double-Headed Hellhound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the black lotus slowly rotated, numerous lotus petals began to bloom. The entire world seemed to become dim at this moment as the Spiritual Aura within the world converged on the black lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This fluctuation was extremely alarming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within Liu Jingshan’s blood-red eyes, a hint of unease flashed. From the mysterious black lotus, he could feel a hint of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the only thing he could do was to use all of his strength to resist it. This was definitely Mu Chen’s last resort. As long as he managed to block it, it was certain that Mu Chen would die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A roar filled with killing intent rang out from Liu Jingshan’s mouth. A ferocious aura surged out from his body as the two hound heads opened their hideous mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flames and black winds gathered rapidly within the respective mouths, distorting the surrounding air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody in the city watched this scene nervously. They could tell that the two people in the sky were using their last resorts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackwyrm Firestorm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, all of the Spiritual Energy within Liu Jingshan’s body began to circulate. The fiery light and black winds, located at each of their hideously respective mouths, expanded hundreds of meters in size. In an instant, a roar containing a murderous intent bellowed out once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire sky seemed to tremble at this moment. Then, countless individuals were witnesses as a flame dragon and a black wind dragon, each hundreds of meters tall, rushed out from Liu Jingshan’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two enormous dragons charged towards the sky and entwined with each other. As the two dragons converged, the flames were fanned by the winds, and it burned more furiously. The violent ferocity of the Spiritual Energy also increased exponentially and was extremely shocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This attack was truly Liu Jingshan’s strongest technique!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody watched the entwined twin dragons in awe. These dragons carried a peerless Spiritual Energy as they charged directly towards the mysterious black lotus. Behind them, a long tail formed by shining lights emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the final lotus petal slowly bloomed on the mysterious lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark-black light, like darkness that invaded the earth, converged swiftly at the center of the black lotus. In the center of the lotus, a black liquid seemed to be dripping down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the dark-black light suddenly became stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody noticed that the mysterious black lotus trembled slightly at this moment. Then, a black beam that was hundreds of meters wide silently erupted from the black lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, this black light beam did not possess an overly violent Spiritual Energy. It was like a black pillar of water that descended down from the sky as it surged through the sky. Under many people’s nervous gazes, it collided with the fire and wind dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Spiritual Energy shockwave emitted from the point of contact, and the entire world seemed to tremble at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The twin dragons roared and struggled to breakthrough. Waves of matchless and violent Spiritual Energy emitted out and attempted to dissipate the black light pillar that descended upon it. However, what shocked everyone was that no matter what the twin dragons did, the black light beam remained motionless. It was like a pillar &nbsp;supporting the sky and was unmoved by the confronting dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Liu Jingshan watched this scene, the uneasiness within his eyes increased. Although the black light beam was not extraordinarily imposing, it still gave him the chills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the distance, Mu Chen watched the confrontation in the sky calmly. He immediately moved his fingers gently and the black lotus in midair crumbled. It turned into a black liquid and fused with the black light beam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swish</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the black lotus faded away, an enormous black lotus imprint emerged on the surface of the black light beam. The hidden brilliance within it had finally been exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hidden dark-black lights erupted from the light beam. At this moment, the twin dragons gave a shrill cry. Then, many people were aghast to see that cracks had surfaced on the fire and wind dragons’ bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Liu Jingshan’s eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shocking sound resounded out. The black light beam had actually penetrated through the fire and wind dragons forcibly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the instant that the twin dragons were penetrated, horror poured out from Liu Jingshan’s eyes. A feeling of death swarmed through and consumed his heart in terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the threat of death, he immediately turned into a black light and retreated. He could feel that he would definitely die if that mysterious black light landed on him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Waa!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sounds of shock broke out in the city as they noticed Liu Jingshan fleeing suddenly. Even Liu Qingtian’s expression had turned pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to escape?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chen’s cold eyes stared at the black light that was Liu Jingshan. He had used all possible measures in order to force Liu Jingshan to this hopeless situation. If he allowed him to escape, everything he did would be completely useless. After all, the latter would come back after he rested for a period of time. As for Mu Chen, he wouldn’t be able to borrow the Nine Netherbird’s power every time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, he must eliminate Liu Jingshan so there wouldn’t be any future troubles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the killing intent within Mu Chen’s heart surged, the black light beam that had pierced through the twin dragons suddenly made a turn. It tore through the sky and chased after Liu Jingshan at an intense speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black light beam was as swift as lightning. In only a few seconds, it had appeared behind Liu Jingshan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jingshan shouted in horror. He furiously roused his Spiritual Energy and placed a massive Spiritual Energy barrier behind his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the black light beam did not care and charged straight at it. Finally, it landed on the Spiritual Energy barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kacha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seemingly powerful Spiritual Energy barrier was completely ineffective at this moment. The black light beam was like the sickle of a death god, and it easily ripped through the Spiritual Energy barrier. Then, it smashed into the Double-Headed Hellhound, which was Liu Jingshan, fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Liu Jingshan’s cries of despair and fear resounded throughout the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amidst the screams, the black light beam forcefully pierced through Liu Jingshan’s body before it shot off to a distant mountain. The entire earth trembled as the mountain instantly vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the entire city was completely silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because they had witnessed the Double-Headed Hellhound disappearing completely as the black light beam passed by, not even its bones remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a scene as though he had been forcefully erased from the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky, the violent Spiritual Energy fluctuations subsided quickly. Even the extraordinary battle earlier had completely faded away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the city, numerous people exchanged glances with each other as they stared at the empty sky. Liu Jingshan was killed just like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Heavenly Fusion Stage powerhouse had fallen like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingtian, Liu Mubai and the others stared blankly at the place where Liu Jingshan had vanished. A feeling of dizziness emerged from their minds and they could not help but sit down on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excellent situation they had originally, the ambitions of dominating the Northern Spiritual Realm, all of this was completely destroyed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>And everything was caused by Mu Chen, who they did not think of highly before?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could this be…” Liu Qingtian’s body trembled. His eyes no longer had the sharpness they had earlier. What replaced it was a deep sense of fear. This time, the Liu Territory had offended all the forces within the Northern Spiritual Realm. Yet, the only person they could have possibly relied on had been killed. From now on, the Liu Territory would definitely take a severe blow within the Northern Spiritual Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beside Liu Qingtian, the other 3 Territory Lords that did not help out Mu Feng and the others also took a deep breath. They stared grimly at Liu Qingtian and slowly moved away. It was evident that they did not want to have any relation to the Liu Territory anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Mu Feng. I never imagined that your Mu Territory would actually have hidden such a trump card,” Tang Shan muttered as he recovered from his shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few Territory Lords nearby also looked at Mu Feng with a complex expression. Within their eyes, fear arose. They were genuinely shocked by the attack that Mu Chen had unleashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder Mu Chen was able to become the only person that qualified for the Spiritual Road within the Northern Spiritual Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Mu Feng could only smile bitterly. He knew nothing about this. Moreover, he did not expect that Mu Chen possessed such power…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky, Mu Chen glanced at the place where Liu Jingshan had vanished. After he confirmed that the latter’s aura had completely vanished, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But just as he sighed, the power within his body rapidly subsided. A feeling of powerlessness quickly emerged. At the same time, intense pain rose throughout his body and he felt that his body had become completely useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Powerlessness surged through Mu Chen’s mind. In the end, his body wobbled and he lost consciousness as he fell from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Mu Feng hurriedly rushed out and caught Mu Chen, who was completely covered in blood. Then, he landed on the ground carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Mu, is he alright?” Tang Qian’Er hurriedly approached. She could not help but bite her lips when she noticed that Mu Chen was covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His is still breathing. He should only be unconscious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Feng examined Mu Chen for a while before letting out a heavy sigh of relief. Then, he exchanged gazes with Tang Shan and the others. A hint of chill flashed through their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qian’Er, please take care of this boy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Feng handed over the unconscious Mu Chen to Tang Qian’Er. When the girl saw this, she hurriedly grabbed onto Mu Chen’s waist without caring about the tainted blood all over his body. The robust feeling and manly aura made her blush. Then, she secretly stared at the unconscious boy’s handsome face as her heartbeat increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tang Qian’Er’s heartbeat increased, many people within the city were staring at the Territory Lords, who approached the Liu Territory’s troops with expressions devoid of compassion. They secretly sighed to themselves. Next up, it would be the concluding act. The Liu Territory’s position within the Northern Spiritual Realm would definitely plummet. On the other hand, by relying on the fear of Mu Chen, the Mu Territory would undoubtedly become the strongest force within the Northern Spiritual Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The setup of the Northern Spiritual Realm would still change. However, it was still many times better than having been forcibly annexed by the Liu Territory…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of this was due to this boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few gazes stared at the boy in the beautiful girl’s arms. Their hands covered their mouths, and a touch of admiration passed through their eyes. The Mu Territory’s Little Lord had definitely exceeded his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this battle, Mu Chen’s name would definitely become known to everyone in the Northern Spiritual Realm.</span></p>
