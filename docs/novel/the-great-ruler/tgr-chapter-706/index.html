Countless people were exchanging glances as they vaguely felt the sparks in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, such bravery.”</span></p>

Shortly after, he clenched his fist as the torrential Battle Will that was similar to a sea of blood emitted a tremendous stench of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tian smiled with his eyes narrowed while looking at Mu Chen. “Since your Nine Nether Palace has chosen to act, then you guys will have to bear the consequences. Right now, don’t expect the Nine Nether King to save you all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was smiling, his smile was giving off an eerie killing intent that was dense to the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll gift those words to Commander Wu Tian. At that time, the Lord Blood Hawk King can only watch as the Blood Hawk Troop greatly suffers.” Mu Chen faintly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, courageous!”</span></p>

He suddenly waved his hand with a sneer, “Then, we’ll see who will be able to destroy who!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

The bark was thunderous as scarlet Spiritual Energy with bloodlust soared into the sky, dying the entire sky red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood sea beneath Wu Tian also grew even more majestic as a might swept out between the heavens and earth, causing violent gales to sweep out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the sight of this, Tang Bing’s face slightly changed. Wu Tian was in control of the Blood Hawk Troop for so many years, so he was somewhat familiar with the Battle Will formed by the Blood Hawk Hall. The moment he controls it, the might would definitely be very terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen…” Tang Bing looked at Mu Chen with traces of worry in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gave her a warm smile as he softly said, “Big Sister Tang Bing, rest assured. The Nine Nether Troop is your effort for all these years, they aren’t weaker than anyone. Also, since Big Sister Tang Bing has handed them over to me, then I will not allow anyone to defeat them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the disappearance of Nine Nether had caused the Nine Nether Palace to fall from a great height, Tang Bing had never given up on the training of the Nine Nether Troop. It was so much so that she was willing to give out her share of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid over to the Nine Nether Troop for their cultivation. It could be said that the Nine Nether Troop was Tang Bing’s fruits of effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of such effort from Tang Bing that the Nine Nether Troop did not leave the Nine Nether Palace despite it declining and maintained their fighting powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Nine Nether Troop was incomparable to the Blood Hawk Troop in regards to numbers, it wasn’t inferior regarding quality!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bing looked at Mu Chen’s warm smile and felt sour in her nose. Her eyes turned a little red. It might seem foolish for her to hold on for all these years, but she still held on. Now that her perseverance was acknowledged, she felt a little moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, be careful.” Tang Bing’s lips slowly split apart as a sweet voice resounded. It was exceptionally gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head and lowered his eyes to look at the Nine Nether Troop that was donned in black armour. From their eyes, there wasn’t the slightest bit of fear, but a fighting intent that had been suppressed for a long time. Perhaps they had been waiting for this day for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As long as you guys are not afraid, then I will lead you guys to face any opponents.” Mu Chen muttered in his heart to himself. Shortly after, a chill gathered in his black pupils as he abruptly waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Nether Battle Will!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heavy black halberds in the hands of the Nine Nether Troop heavily stomped on the ground, along with a heavy bark that resonated throughout the horizon like a thunderous explosion. The Nine Nether Battle Will rose like a black cloud and covered the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the two Battle Wills spreading across the sky, it split the sky into two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone gradually retreated out of the envelopment of the two troops at this instant, since they were clear that the moment the two parties clashed, the commotion would not be comparable to before. It was so much so that the city might not be safe from the impact, because the two parties seemed like they weren’t bothered by the outcome of the battle…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire city was silent, only the two Battle Wills that were up in the sky were whistling like a flood as they wreaked havoc between the heavens and earth, as if two ferocious beasts were throwing themselves against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the frozen atmosphere, Mu Chen and Wu Tian’s gazes suddenly turned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two tremendous Battle Wills whistle out in an instant. They were like myriads of waves surging as they violently flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was closely staring at the sky and had their hearts lifted. They were about to witness the two troops of the Great Havenlaw Domain confronting one another. But when the two forces were about to confront one another in the sky, space suddenly distorted and a light figure abruptly appeared in the sky. Shortly after, he flipped his hand, and the two tremendous Battle Wills were suppressed by him with a single palm. After that, they were reduced to nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden changes made countless people go into an uproar. Directing their gazes over, the entire city slightly boiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the… Sleeping Emperor of the three Emperors of Great Havenlaw Domain?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never thought that such a figure would make a move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the sky, Mu Chen and Wu Tian were also briefly stunned when they saw that light figure and immediately cupped their fists. ““We pay our greetings to the Lord.””</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light figure lazily waved his hand. It clearly wasn’t Sleeping Emperor’s real body that descended, but was a clone of Spiritual Energy. But just this clone alone could easily destroy the Battle Wills of the Blood Hawk Troop and Nine Nether Troop. That strength of his was truly deep and unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although it is within the rules for you guys to fight, the Demonic Python City is an important city, after all. If it was destroyed, the loss would be considerable.” Sleeping Emperor faintly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is not what our Blood Hawk Hall wishes for. Mu Chen was the one being overbearing and not knowing the immensity of the heavens and earth. So I hope that your Lordship will dismiss his position as a Commander.” Wu Tian solemnly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our Nine Nether Palace only wishes to take back the cities that belong to us. Your Blood Hawk Hall is the one that obstructs us. So paying whatever cost for it should be a given.” Mu Chen’s tone was calm, but there were hints of picking a fight in his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sleeping Emperor waved his hand as he broke the dispute between the two, “This isn’t the place for a battle to break out. You guys should stop before going too far. Also, the expedition of my Great Havenlaw Domain will soon start, and the vast territories will also be within our sight of expeditions. So why is your vision limited to here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tian lightly frowned his brows, the Sleeping Emperor possessed a high position in the Great Havenlaw Domain. With Wu Tian’s position, it was natural that he did not dare to refute his words. But if today’s matters were to be put to rest like this, there wouldn’t be any benefit for their Blood Hawk Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Lord Meng’s words make sense. These cities have been managed by my Blood Hawk Hall for many years, and the Nine Nether Palace wants to take them back right now. Wouldn’t that be benefiting them too easily?” When Wu Tian was silent, there was a laughter that suddenly rang between the heavens and earth. After that, a faint light figure had also appeared in the sky of the Blood Hawk Hall. Judging from his appearance, it was the Blood Hawk King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Blood Hawk King showing up, Wu Tian felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Then what does your Blood Hawk Hall want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But along with the appearance of the Blood Hawk King, another mocking voice rang out as well. Nine Nether’s fuzzy light figure had also appeared in a flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging from their looks, the two of them were clearly paying attention to this place. Now that the Sleeping Emperor appeared, only now did they show themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people watched this scene from the city as they inwardly smacked their lips. They did not think that this confrontation would even cause the Nine Nether King and the Blood Hawk King to appear. The two forces were surely similar to a relationship between water and fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do we want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Hawk King’s gaze flickered as he sneered, “It’s possible, if you guys want to take back those cities. Since Lord Meng has said that this place isn’t suitable to fight, then my Blood Hawk Troop will await you in the Military Battlefield three days from. As long as you defeat my Blood Hawk Troop, not only will we return the fifty cities. I will also offer another fifty cities and five Sovereign Elixirs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rustle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Blood Hawk King’s words resounded, it caused countless clamours. It looked like everyone was stunned by his fortune. In that moment, he was betting a hundred cities and five Sovereign Elixirs that were incredibly precious. It was said that any Sovereign beneath the Fourth Grade could experience a grade of enhancement in their strength upon refining them. They were treasures that made countless Sovereign experts rush like ducks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether was also briefly stunned, since she never thought that the Blood Hawk King would have such courage. It looks like he had really gambled his hard-earned capital just to deal with the Nine Nether Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But… if your Nine Nether Palace loses, I will not request anything as long as you pledge your allegiance to my Blood Hawk Hall. Naturally, I will not meddle with the affairs of the Nine Nether Palace.” Blood Hawk Hall faintly smiled as he continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Tang Bing’s brows slightly lifted as her complexion turned pale. The Blood Hawk King was genuinely ambitious, using all sorts of means just to humiliate their Nine Nether Palace. The moment they submitted to the Blood Hawk Hall, although it was only just a declaration, their Nine Nether Palace would thoroughly lose their morale and entirely collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the side, Mu Chen had his eyes slightly narrowed with a chill surging in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sleeping Emperor briefly frowned his brows, but he did not speak a single word. After all, the competition in the Great Havenlaw Domain was very intense, and only through competitions, could they maintain the vigour between the various factions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about it? If you guys do not dare to agree to it, I will not mock you. But you can only dream on taking these cities back.” Blood Hawk King was looking at Nine Nether with mockery as he said that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s face was cold. She naturally knew about the Blood Hawk King’s vicious thoughts. Shortly after, she turned her head, looking at the slender figure. The Blood Hawk King was undoubtedly referring to a battle between the two troops, and Mu Chen was the Commander of the Nine Nether Troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regarding this challenge, it would have to depend on Mu Chen’s decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single gaze was also directed at Mu Chen. Wu Tian had his arms crossed with a ruminating smile hung on his lips as he looked at Mu Chen. This move from the Blood Hawk King had forced the Nine Nether Palace into a dead end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the countless gazes, a cold smile that was similar to a blade rose from the corner of Mu Chen’s lips. Shortly after, he raised his head and lightly nodded his head towards Nine Nether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching Mu Chen’s response, Nine Nether was stunned before clenching her teeth, and her cold voice resonated throughout this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, our Nine Nether Palace will accept this challenge!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Blood Hawk Hall better get the things prepared on the Military Battlefield three days from now!”</span></p>
