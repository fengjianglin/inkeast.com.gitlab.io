 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Wood Academy sat at the highest point of the Divine Wood Mountain. Looking from outside the Divine Wood Mountain, one could vaguely see that there was an imposing building on top of the colossal mountain. It stood quietly and towering, as if it was overlooking this land. In the ancient times, this region had the most governing power to the other big and small forces in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and his party did not make any stops along their way and despite so, when they gradually approached the Divine Wood Academy, it had already taken half a day of their time. Fortunately, there wasn’t any sunset or sunrise in the Divine Wood Palace. Dazzling light covered this region at anytime and anywhere. Thus, this was why the trees were lush to such a fearsome degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhuuuu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen and his party landed on a mountain peak as they directed their gazes over. There was a smear of astonishment surfacing in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At a good distance away, there was a mountain towering into the sky. The mountain peak formed blades as it was extremely precipitous. It was impossible to climb over it and on the peak of the mountain, there was a deep green ancient palace quietly sitting on it. There was a green light circle that was roughly a few thousand feet that made it seem like a ring of a planet around the palace’s surroundings. The divine appearance of it was astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truly deserving to the called the Divine Wood Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen sighed. Even after the flow of time for the hundreds or thousands of years, they could still feel the powerful might of the Divine Wood Palace from the ancient times that could still be emitted from some fine areas that made others feel respect when looking at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gradually withdrew his gaze as he swept towards the surroundings. Thereafter, he could see countless streaks of light flying over at this direction from the distance and landed on the peaks that were tens of thousands of meters high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, as time passed, more and more teams gathered onto this region. Mu Chen was not surprised by it as anyone could feel that this palace was the most important location of the Divine Wood Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the tens of thousands of meters peaks, it was as if a bell from the ancient times had suddenly resounded. Within the sound, it gave off a worldly transformation sensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Divine Wood Academy?” Xu Huang and the rest gazed upon the ancient great palace on the peak with blazing gazes as they turned to Mu Chen, “Shall we act?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to rush.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, however, slowly shook his head as his gaze was firmly on the light ring around the great palace as he felt a daunting ripple coming from it as he lightly said, “This Divine Wood Academy is not easy to approach. The light ring is not useless as well. Just with us alone, it’s impossible for us to barge into it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct, the headquarters of various forces have their own powerful defences. Although the Divine Wood Palace has already crumbled with the flow of time, it is still not something that we could recklessly barge in.” Luo Li said with her head nodding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan’s charming gaze had also landed on the huge light ring as her expression turned grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that response, Xu Huang and the rest immediately broke the anxiousness in their hearts, since they were well-aware of Mu Chen and the other two’s strength. Since even they felt danger, then it was naturally not something that they can deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen, Luo Li and Wen Qingxuan exchanged a glance as they became silent as they waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time rapidly flowed by as the three of them waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, there were countless sonic booms resounding as an earth-shattering amount of light streaked over. Thereafter, they were like locusts as they landed on trees of the various mountain peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes of all those teams that came here were all directed onto the ancient palace on top of the towering peak. Their gazes were blazing with greed as they knew that this area was the most important location of the Divine Wood Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhuuuuu</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another break of wind resounded as another group of people arrived and hovered in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen directed his gaze over and, thereafter, he rubbed his nose. The group that just came was from the Martial Spiritual Academy and the one leading had a fine figure and wearing a fiery-red dress. What caught the attention of others was her crescent blade that was even bigger then herself. She was also returning his gaze with a chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Wu Yingying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You meet again.” Wen Qingxuan chuckled as she looked at Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen helplessly smiled. Previously, on the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, Wu Yingying did not ally herself with Wang Zhong to deal with him, which made him a little surprised, and caused him to have a good opinion about Wu Yingying. Although this young girl was a fiery spice, her character wasn’t unruly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when Mu Chen saw that Wu Yingying had come, he gave her a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in contrast to his goodwill, Wu Yingying’s face was chill as she coldly snorted and turned her head around, no longer bothered about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having his warm face on a cold butt, Mu Chen felt a little awkward and could only shrug his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Wu Yingying’s group, there were also several other powerful teams that had appeared. Among them that made Mu Chen startled was that in this Divine Wood Palace, some teams seemed to have obtained a good opportunity, which made their team, as a whole, to rise in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As more and more teams rushed over, several familiar teams began to show themselves, which include Wang Zhong from the Saint Spiritual Academy and the party from the Four Seas Spiritual Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen softly exclaimed when he saw Wang Zhong as his brows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That fellow’s strength has grown.” Wen Qingxuan had also sensed it as she spoke in astonishment, “It seems that he has already refined the Spiritual Treasure from the Spiritual Treasure Mountain, borrowing it to step into Spirit Disaster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed, worthy of being the most eldest amongst the Four Holy Sons of the Saint Spiritual Academy.” Mu Chen said softly. This Wang Zhong was indeed capable as he was so decisive in refining the Spiritual Treasure at this time and step into Spirit Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen could naturally sense that the Spiritual Energy around Wang Zhong had grown stronger compared to the time at the Spiritual Treasure Mountain. The faint pressure being emitted from him had already shown that he had stepped into First Grade Spirit Disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen had his attention on Wang Zhong, the latter had also directed his cold gaze over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mu Chen smiled at his cold gaze. First Grade Spirit Disaster was indeed powerful, but it still wasn’t something that could make him feel pressured. This Wang Zhong must have suffered a great blow when Mu Chen defeated the First Grade Spirit Disaster puppet back at the Spiritual Treasure Mountain. Otherwise, he wouldn’t make any breakthroughs at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhong must be clear that if his strength remained as it was, he would have lost the qualification to fight with Mu Chen in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shhhhuuuuu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another break of wind resounded and Mu Chen directed his gaze over. He saw a large amount of unevenly matched people approaching. However, with their numbers, it was still rather intimidating.</span></p>
