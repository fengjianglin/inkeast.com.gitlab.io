Thus, they were not obstructed along the way. In addition to the three of them being able to use Spiritual Energy, after roughly ten minutes, they had already passed through the spike tree forest and smoothly exited the shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they walked out of the shadows that were formed by the spike trees, they felt as if their bodies had instantly lightened.

The feeling of having their Spiritual Energies suppressed was too uncomfortable.</span></p>

After experiencing the feeling of not being able to use any Spiritual Energy, only then did she realise that the Spiritual Energy that flowed between this heaven and earth was so enchanting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you being like this? In the Spiritual Road, it was an entire two years that we were not able to use any Spiritual Energy.” Mu Chen smiled.</span></p>

He raised his head and looked beyond the distance of this forest, then realised that there were many other Spiritual Energy ripples in this region…</span></p>

There were figures of people appearing in his sight. There seemed to be several teams that were looking at their direction. In the depths of their eyes was a dense amount of greed and fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?” Luo Li had also noticed this scene and in an instant, she furrowed her brows. She tightened her grip on her Luo God Sword as she felt that something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan lightly snorted as a golden warspear flickered with golden light in her hand. Her gaze brought along a chill as it swept through and all those that exchanged contact with her could not help shifting their gazes away.</span></p>

Mu Chen and his group turned their gazes over and saw a few figures flying over, before landing by their side. It was Xu Huang and the rest that had been waiting outside of the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Xu Huang and group saw that Mu Chen’s group of three had smoothly come out, only then did they feel relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys finally came out,” said Xu Huang.</span></p>

Previously, when they entered here, there weren’t so many people around here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Half a day ago, the group from the Academy Alliance came out.” Xu Huang glanced at Mu Chen’s group of three as a smear of astonishment could be seen in his eyes, “You guys were the ones that chased them out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen nodded his head in acknowledgement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What monsters.” Xu Huang and the rest were speechless. They had clearly seen the amount of people from the Academy Alliance. They had nearly two hundred in number and all of them had refined their physical bodies in the past. Even if they could not use any Spiritual Energy in the forest, they would still be hard to deal with. However, despite so, the three of them chased them out like stray dogs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After the group from the Academy Alliance came out, their facial expressions were ugly. We hid ourselves for the time being. Thereafter, those fellows started to spread some news…” Xu Huang said helplessly, “They announced that there was a Hidden Spiritual Courtyard which contained Sovereign Spiritual Liquid that the Divine Wood Palace had been storing for countless years. There were at least tens of thousands of drops…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brows of Mu Chen furrowed. Those people of the Academy Alliance wete indeed vicious. Seeing as they could not obtain the stuff from the Hidden Spiritual Courtyard, they decided to spread the news so Mu Chen and his group could not have any peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tens of thousands of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid, those fellows had quite a wild imagination. However, Mu Chen knew that once this news was released, it would still bring them quite a bit of trouble, even if it was false. The Sovereign Spiritual Liquid was simply too precious. Everyone knew that if the amount had really reached tens of thousands, even Sovereign realm experts would be fighting over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not many Sovereign realm experts had accumulated such an amount of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tens of thousands of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid could allow a Sovereign realm expert to be suddenly wealthy.</span></p>

Although they do not dare to do anything to the three of you, the amount that they have gathered is quite troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, just some average fellows. If they have the capability, then come and snatch. If any of them could win against me, I will give them all the Sovereign Spiritual Liquid in my possession. Just that they will probably die from that appetite of theirs.” Wen Qingxuan coldly snorted as her face was covered in frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Huang dryly laughed as they thought in their hearts,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She is indeed, worthy of being someone that has gotten first place once, such dominance…</span></p>

The ten figures had powerful Spiritual Energy ripples around them. All of them were actually someone that had gone through Spiritual Energy Disaster. Clearly, they were Captains from a few decent teams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind them, there were nearly ten teams that were staring at Mu Chen and his group.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait!”</span></p>

However, there are nearly a hundred teams here waiting for you. If all of us were to fight, you guys might not take it well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you want then?” Mu Chen finally took a glance at him as his tone was apathetic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, we only want Captain Mu Chen to give every one of us ten drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid and we will not make things difficult for your group.” Chen Ya quickly said when he heard Mu Chen’s reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten drops of Sovereign Spiritual Liquid? Who are you?” Wen Qingxuan said with a chilled face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took a step forward as her golden warspear dazzled with brilliant golden light that spread out. In an instant, a fearsome Spiritual Energy pressure began to expand and under the pressure of that Spiritual Energy, the faces of Chen Ya and everyone else could not help changing as astonishment filled their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spirit Disaster?”</span></p>
