Shortly after, everyone started to ponder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some gazes faintly glanced at the indifferent figure on the upper floors. Liu Yan had a well-known fame amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region, being placed fourth on the Dragon-Phoenix Record proved his status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if those gathered in the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion could be considered the elites amongst the younger generations of the Northern Region, it was unavoidable for them to feel fear when facing Liu Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a person was naturally the most powerful competitor in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven, which no one dared to underestimate in the slightest. So, when they suddenly saw someone that dared to mention Liu Yan’s name this way, their expressions became interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up on the upper floors, there weren’t many ripples on Liu Yan’s face when he heard this, he only faintly laughed with a slightly superior attitude. In this place, he was clearly not a nameless figure like Mu Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he were to be bothered with Mu Chen so easily, it would lower his status instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around Liu Yan, some younger experts who had good relations with him let out low sneers and some ill gazes started to shift towards the youthful figure below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red-dressed girl, who was the main focus in the entire Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion, had also lightly laughed out with some interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When every single gaze in the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion was directed over, the young expert that extended his hand out to Mu Chen earlier had his face turning a little dark. He clearly did not imagine that a Third Grade Sovereign would actually ignore him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was somewhat subtle and did not flip on the spot, but took a step back and cupped his fists with a faint laughter, “I am Lu Yang of the Snow Dragon Mountains. What is your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Dragon Mountains could be considered as a big force in the Northern Region, comparable to the Hundred Battles Domain and Lu Yang was the most outstanding amongst the younger generation of the Snow Dragon Mountain. He also possessed a strength that probably wasn’t any weaker than Qin Bei of the Hundred Battles Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there was quite a gap between Lu Yang and Liu Yan’s strength, he had some influence in this Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion. Therefore, many people had heard of his reputation as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s back faced Lu Yang, his handsome face was a little cold. He never thought that he would encounter Liu Yan here. Furthermore, he also did not imagine that Liu Yan would be so impatient and wanted to act against him before he could even warm his seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that fellow seemed to be somewhat haughty, since he did not directly act against Mu Chen himself. He probably thought that the latter did not possess that sort of qualification for him to do that. Thus, under his hint, this pack of scoundrel friends of his jumped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Xiao sat beside Mu Chen with her hands supporting her cheeks while looking at this scene, before giving Mu Chen a light smile. “Looks like your ability to attract trouble isn’t any weaker than my own. They even came looking for trouble with you right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no change in Mu Chen’s expression, since he did not turn back to look at Lu Yang of the Snow Dragon Mountains. No matter what, the Great Havenlaw Domain was at least a peak force in the Northern Region. If it was at normal times, the Snow Dragon Mountains wouldn’t even dare to let out a fart. Now that this Lu Yang actually dared to be so domineering before him, he would embarrass the Great Havenlaw Domain if he were to respond to such a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yan was arrogant, but how would he know that the pride in the heart of this handsome and gentle youth was so much higher than his?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reporting his name and not getting a response from Mu Chen, the corner of Lu Yang’s lips uncontrollably twitched as hostility surged within his eyes. Since when did a Third Grade Sovereign dare to behave in this manner before him? Did he really think that this place was the Great Havenlaw Domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like this friend is dispising my Snow Dragon Mountains for not being heavyweighted enough… Haha, with the strength of the Great Havenlaw Domain, it does have such qualifications.” Lu Yang smiled as a smear of ridicule flashed in his eyes as he continued, “But, did you think that you are qualified to behave this way?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lu Yang finished his last word, his eyes abruptly turned cold as boundless Spiritual Energy burst out from his body like a storm. The strength of his Spiritual Energy even caused many experts in the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion to raise an eyebrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yang’s strength was probably vaguely touching the Fourth Grade Sovereign Realm. With such a strength, even if he could not be considered as the peak amongst the younger generations, he would only be a level beneath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yang’s face turned cold as he stomped his feet, before his figure quickly burst out. Boundless ocean-like Spiritual Energy gathered and fluctuated in his palms as he furiously pounced towards Mu Chen without the slightest leniency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had intended to use his strength to teach this brat from the Great Havenlaw Domain that not even the Great Havenlaw Domain could protect his laughable pride here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this place, no one cared where you were from. As long as your strength wasn’t high enough, then you could only scram from the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snow Dragon Palm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He issued a low and deep bark as a glacier-like chilled air swept out from Lu Yang’s palm. A huge snow dragon flew out and enveloped the area that Mu Chen was at with snowflakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion, many gazes had slightly narrowed at this sight. This Lu Yang was truly ruthless to be executing his greatest move the instant he attacked. If one were to be hit by the icy aura of the Snow Dragon Mountains gathered in that Snow Dragon Palm, even the Spiritual Energy in the body would be frozen. Even if they expelled it, their meridians would be damaged. Having damaged meridians at this sort of time meant that this young man from the Great Havenlaw Domain could no longer participate in the Dragon-Phoenix Haven…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the snowflakes swept over from his rear, Mu Chen’s figure still remained still. However, Cai Xiao, who had been facing him, suddenly narrowed her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because she saw that Mu Chen’s black pupils were swiftly turning pitch-black. In that instant, his facial expression became indifferent, without the slightest liveliness from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, if the Spiritual Energy around Mu Chen had slight signs of surging earlier, then the Spiritual Energy around him had quickly retracted at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That didn’t mean that Mu Chen’s Spiritual Energy had weakened, that meant that in that instant, he had perfect control over his Spiritual Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s slender hand lifted the teacup before him and lightly took a sip as the terrifying chill swept over from his rear. There were even snowflakes on his hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion, many experts had astonished gazes as they saw how calm Mu Chen was at that moment. Didn’t he know that the fatal attack coming from his rear was about to reach him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But judging from the Spiritual Energy fluctuations around Mu Chen, he didn’t seem to have any intention of defending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that fellow doing? Is he courting death?” Someone murmured in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That abnormal scene instantly attracted many puzzled voices. It was so much so that there were even light exclamations coming from several figures in the dark on upper floors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’re courting death, then you can’t blame me!”</span></p>

At this distance, it was too late for Mu Chen to defend himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never thought that the young expert representing the Great Havenlaw Domain would be such a fool!
