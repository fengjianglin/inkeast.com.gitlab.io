 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three black lotuses streaked across the horizon as they silently hammered against the light figure shrouded in lava armour. There wasn’t any earth-shattering commotion from the instant of contact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black light was like liquid as it exploded, swiftly corroding the lava armour. Stained by the liquid, lava was instantly extinguished while it was slowly getting dissolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t any earth-shattering explosion. The silent contact possessed heart palpitation energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Flames Celestial Body formed by Liu Ming had turned stiff as his blazing eyes looked at the ink spreading on his enormous body and a dense fear surged in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He realised that as the black light spread, his Heavenly Flames Celestial Body was rapidly losing strength. That sensation was like his Sovereign Celestial Body was being contaminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it, just what Spiritual Array is that?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shock rose in Liu Ming’s heart as he abruptly clenched his teeth, issuing a roar from the depths of his throat. The Spiritual Energy in this region was boiling as rolling lava poured from the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body. In the end, it was like lava as it spread towards the strange black light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pfff! Pfff!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two dominant forces clashed as they exploded white mists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scarlet lava was continuously emitting great energy as it attempted to smear away the black light. The latter was like a pest as it stuck firmly on it. The momentum that didn’t seem powerful was still able to firmly corrode the lava flow, bit by bit…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s gaze was cold as he watched this scene; shortly after, he changed his seal again as a deep voice came from his mouth, “Black Lotus Erosion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz! Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his seal changed, the flow of the black liquid increased in speed. In barely ten breath’s of time, half of the colossal Heavenly Flames Celestial Body was coloured black, with the Spiritual Energy contained within it disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Ming’s face was dumbfounded as he finally felt fear in his heart. He attempted to escape, but he realised that he could no longer move his body. He immediately barked, “Brat, if you dare touch me, my Sky Profound Palace will chase after you even to the end of the seas, you understand me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen maintained an indifferent expression, he paid no attention and increased his corroding speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Threatening him didn’t work; instead, because of the increased the killing intent of Mu Chen, his voice immediately turned soft. “Wait, I’ll admit defeat. I will hand over the Undying Divine Leaf and the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Mu Chen, there was a smear of ridicule hung on the latter’s black pupils. Judging from that look, he seemed to be ridiculing his foolish actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Saying it now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen slowly raised his slender hand and clenched his fist abruptly with a cold gaze, “You’re truly stupid!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the grudge was already set, Mu Chen definitely wouldn’t be lenient as he knew that it would bring even more troubles to him instead. With Liu Ming’s background, it was indeed troublesome for him. Thus, he wouldn’t be stupid enough for a peaceful settlement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The liquid-like black light rapidly spread out, along the neck of the Heavenly Flames Celestial Body, and along the face, spreading throughout the colossal Celestial Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Flames Celestial Body froze in an instant, even Liu Ming’s mouth, which was roaring, had turned stiff. The surging Spiritual Energy around him had rapidly calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Flames Celestial Body, which was awe-inspiring, was like extinguished lava, turning into black cold rocks…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Energy was no longer present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen looked at the cold and black stone giant as a chill gathered in his eyes again. Shortly after, he stomped his feet and flew out. Purple Spiritual Energy that was like a gale gathered in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Spiritual Energy harboured killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Mu Chen revealed his killing intent, a bark resounded from afar. The black-clothed elderly man that was held up by Nine Nether had his face turn pale. He apparently never thought that Liu Ming would fall by Mu Chen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black-clothed elderly man retreated and was about to attack Mu Chen. If anything happened to Liu Ming, the Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace would definitely not let him go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when he retreated, a cold snort rang out. Up in the sky, where a gale blew, was a blazing pair of purple wings that descended. It looked like it was tearing the heavens and earth apart as it swiftly slashed down at the black-clothed elderly man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying ripples descending from the sky caused the face of the black-clothed elderly man to change, especially those startling purple flames. He didn’t dare to slack off when facing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was hit by it head-on, even if he had the cultivation of Fifth Grade Sovereign Realm, he would still suffer a considerable injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the black-clothed elderly man could only clench his teeth and backhandedly throw a slap out, turning into a giant hand forged of Spiritual Energy as it clashed with the descending wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent Spiritual Energy gale swept out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the black-clothed elderly man was obstructed by Nine Nether, Mu Chen’s figure had already appeared before the extinguished lava giant. A palm gale of Spiritual Energy, along with boundless power behind it, swiftly landed on the chest of the giant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent Spiritual Energy that was like tidal water wreaked havoc beneath Mu Chen’s feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Creak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under that Spiritual Energy impact, cracks swiftly spread on the chest of the lava giant. In just a few breath’s time, it had spread throughout the entire body and exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black rocks fell from the sky, along with a figure flying out of the lava giant in a terrible state. Fresh blood spurt as he was shot into a mountain. Even the mountain had crumbled from the dreadful energy, burying the figure swiftly under the stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen stood on air as he glanced at the ruined mountain with indifference. His figure moved, appearing up above as he sent many stones flying out with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As stones flew, a terrible-looking figure that was covered in blood was revealed. He was limp as he laid down in the mess of rocks. His face was pale as fear rose in his eyes as he watched Mu Chen landing down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seems like your Heavenly Flames Celestial Body wasn’t as strong as you thought it to be.” Mu Chen looked at Liu Ming, whose face was covered in shock as he spoke with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Ming stared at Mu Chen with a vicious gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen did not bother about his gaze. He waved his hand, bringing the latter’s Mustard Seed Bracelet into his hand. Although he did not open it, the Undying Divine Leaf and the Nine Dragons and Elephants Art should be in there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A fortune angel, such a good person. Thanks for that.” Mu Chen waved the bracelet in his hand towards Liu Ming as he mocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pffft</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Ming spewed a mouthful of fresh blood as he viciously stared at Mu Chen and said in a hoarse voice, “Did you truly think that I’m that easy to kill? I’m the Young Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was filled with viciousness and a trace of ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen frowned his brows as killing intent flashed across his eyes. There wasn’t any hesitation as he sent a palm out, bringing along a dreadful Spiritual Energy tide as he fiercely slapped towards Liu Ming’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Demonic Human Elder, are you still not going to show yourself? You truly want to see me being killed by him?!” Liu Ming ferociously roared as he watched this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s pupils shrank as his palm sped more ferociously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when his palm was about to land on Liu Ming’s head, he couldn’t budge his palm any further. The surrounding space seemed like it had frozen right at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a ruthless brat… if I were to witness you killing him, it would be hard for me to explain to the Palace Master.” An old and indifferent voice rang out by Mu Chen’s ears. He slowly raised his head, not knowing when a bony grey-clothed elderly man was standing in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The way the grey-clothed elderly man looked at Mu Chen made him feel a chill surging up in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden appearance of the grey-clothed elderly man caused Mu Chen’s face to change. It was so much so that the gazes of the Heart Fairy Fox and the middle-aged man, who were spying on this battle, had difference in their gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s actually one of the three Great Elders of the Sky Profound Palace, the Demonic Human Elder… so this old demon has been secretly protecting Liu Ming. I’ve never expected that!” Heart Fairy Fox spoke with a heavy expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man also revealed an expression of fear. The fame of this Demonic Human Elder was famous in the Skylaw Continent, with the strength of Eighth Grade Sovereign Realm. Even in the Sky Profound Palace, he was an existence with an exalted position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That brat won’t be able to run anymore.” The middle-aged man sighed. Since the Demonic Human Elder showed himself, there wouldn’t be a fight anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of an Eighth Grade Sovereign Realm wasn’t something that they could confront against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s pupils shrank as he looked at the grey-clothed elderly man. In the next instant, his figure abruptly retreated as he barked out at the same time, “Lin Jing, go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the situation up in the sky, Lin Jing was also swiftly retreating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want her to go, but I won’t let her go.” The grey-clothed elderly man laughed as he strode forth. His figure appeared right before Lin Jing as he lightly threw a palm towards the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jing’s face turned slightly pale. Eighth Grade Sovereign Realm wasn’t something that she could contend with. Thus, she could only clench her teeth as she waited for the attack to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just as Lin Jing closed her eyes, a figure had mysteriously arrived as he embraced her and flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want to save her, pay with your life first.” The grey-clothed elder lightly sighed. His dried-up hand seemed like it had transcended space as he slapped towards Mu Chen’s back, who was embracing Lin Jing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pfffft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mouthful of fresh blood spurt out, his back was bloody and severely injured that even bones could be seen. If it weren’t for his Lightning God’s Physique reaching the Nona Rune Lightning Physique, he would have exploded from that palm alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen!” Blood splattered on Lin Jing’s face as she grew anxious while watching this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen fell down, he was still embracing the girl even when he landed. His bloodied back was slamming on stones as the intense pain made him spurt another mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Nether’s eyes grew red in an instant as she watched this scene. She expanded her wings and was about to charge out, but she was tightly held up by the black-clothed elderly man. At this moment, she had also frantically unleashed her attacks, forcing the black-clothed elderly man to be battered and exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mu Chen, are you alright?!” Lin Jing paid no attention to the blood on her face as she anxiously asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gritted his teeth, shaking his head as he pushed Lin Jing. “Go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not going!” Lin Jing dragged onto Mu Chen’s sleeve. She knew that if she left, Mu Chen would definitely die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Mu Chen was enraged, but the intense pain made him suck in a mouthful of air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never thought that things would end up this way. He had still ultimately underestimated the force behind Liu Ming. That sort of great power wasn’t something that the current him could fight against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seems like we have made a blunder.” Mu Chen bitterly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Having the guts to kill the Young Palace Master of the Sky Profound Palace, you’re not that smart.” The grey-clothed elderly man appeared before Mu Chen and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll send you on your way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey-clothed elderly man’s dried hand pierced through space once again, smacking down towards Mu Chen’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen gritted his teeth as his eyes became a little frenzied. Even if he had to give it his all and reveal the immortal page, he wouldn’t just sit and wait for death, even if they couldn’t escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as the grey-clothed elderly man’s dried-up hand was about to land on Mu Chen’s head, space lit up, and a ray of light streaked past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pffft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dry-up hand quietly fell off, landing onto Mu Chen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey-clothed elderly man was slightly stunned as he witnessed his hand suddenly being chopped off. He was still in a daze, his mouth moved, but there was no voice coming out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slightly raised his head and saw the space behind Mu Chen somewhat distorted as a slender figure faintly appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with her appearance, a bright and cold voice resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare to kill the princess of the Martial Realm, you’re foolish as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that familiar voice, Lin Jing abruptly raised her head, her spiritual eyes were filled with joy as she exclaimed, “Mother?!”</span></p>
