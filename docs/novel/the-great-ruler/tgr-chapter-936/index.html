 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to compete for the lumps of light that had appeared from the lake, every expert had unfolded the most intense competition without any restraint.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountain peaks where all the other peak forces were standing were only a few thousand feet in distance away from the lake. With everyone’s speed, it was practically a single breath’s time that they charged above the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Splash!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden attack had left everyone startled. But fortunately, they had all come prepared. After all, everyone knew the danger of this Earth Sovereign Realm Treasury, and if they were too careless, their lives would be in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Spiritual Energy had abruptly swept out from the experts with a yell as the spiritual lights flickered. Instantly, the fist gales swept out with some experts having utilised Divine Artifacts and a powerful might spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poosh! Poosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But despite being prepared, everyone had still belittled the danger that was contained in the lake. The emerald-jade light shot over and in the instant of contact, it had pierced through the Spiritual Energy defences of many experts and shrieks resounded in the region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone had a clear look of those emerald-jade lights. Within those lights were actually small emerald-green snakes. But those snakes were very unusual. They were flat and long like blades. As the snake scales stood up, the entire body of those snakes looked like blades. Furthermore, what was more shocking was the fact that those snakes were filled with ancient runes and a sense of sharpness was spreading along with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen had his Spiritual Energy protecting his body, but it was instantly pierced by the small snake and it was heading towards his throat. In that instant when it was about to touch him, Mu Chen’s palm swept out and a dark-golden light blossomed on his skin. A dragon roar had resounded and Mu Chen had to immediately use his Dragon-Phoenix Physique, instantly causing his physical defence to be extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emerald-green snake shot against Mu Chen’s palm and a metallic collision rang out. The impact had made Mu Chen feel a stinging pain on his palm and his face instantly grew solemn, before he grabbed ahold of the snake with a flip of his hand. As golden light surged, and he had immediately crushed the snake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when the snake exploded, there wasn’t any blood splattering out. It had simply collapsed into sparkles of light as it dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These things were actually refined by someone?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mu Chen saw this scene, he was instantly shocked. He had initially thought that it was a living creature. But looking at it now, it had clearly been refined by someone through special means. Generally speaking, it was somewhat similar to refining Divine Artifacts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That tiny snake had the sharpness of a Low Rank Divine Artifact. Furthermore, with the huge numbers, even a Sixth Grade Sovereign might be struck by it, if they were careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen raised his head and saw that aside from the experts of the other peak forces on a similar level with the three Emperors, the majority of them was in a terrible situation. There were even some unfortunate ones with blood dripping from them after they suffered heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swiftly looked at Nine Nether. Despite being caught a little unexpected, she was a Divine Beast with a stronger physical body that was not any weaker than Mu Chen’s. So she did not suffer any injuries, whereas the other Kings of the Great Havenlaw Domain, like the Blood Hawk King, had shed blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone take caution. These things have been refined by a Divine Artifact’s technique, they specialise in breaking apart Spiritual Energy!” The Sleeping Emperor roared as his voice resounded near everyone’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys gather together. Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor, the two of you come with me to snatch for treasures!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sleeping Emperor cast a glance at the other direction. The sudden assault of those spiritual snakes had caused some obstructions for everyone. But it couldn’t obstruct peak experts, thus the peak experts from the other forces were swiftly making their way towards the centre of the lake and they had all clearly intended to snatch for treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor had solemnly nodded their heads. The three of them had pushed their Spiritual Energies to the limits, then bolted out of the region of those spiritual snakes. In just a few breaths, the three of them were already approaching a lump of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sleeping Emperor had a light flickering in his eyes. He reached out and a suction force burst out, before that lump of light swiftly shot towards his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, put it down!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just when the Sleeping Emperor was about to come in contact with that light, a thunderous roar burst out. Along with that bark, a cold palm gale had pierced through space. As the palm gale whistled, it was filled with a cold energy that caused the air to instantly freeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the experts that entered the rock island had suffered the suppression in the Spiritual Energy in their bodies, they were still peak experts in the Northern Region that were only inferior to the Earth Sovereigns. So their moves were extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the Sleeping Emperor had only coldly sneered when facing this attack, before he threw a palm forth. Boundless Spiritual Energy had immediately formed into a huge vortex beneath his palm and a violent Spiritual Energy wreaked out from the vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vortex roared and clashed with the chilling palm. As the Spiritual Energy vortex distorted, it had immediately devoured the chilling palm before shattering into sparkles of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away, a figure had shot over with a groan coming from his throat. Immediately, he had stopped advancing while solemnly looking at the Sleeping Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was dressed in grey robes, had white hair and a sharp gaze. He’s the West Pavilion Lord of the Divine Pavilion with the strength of an Eighth Grade Sovereign Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But clearly, he was at a disadvantage when he confronted the Sleeping Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sleeping Emperor of the Great Havenlaw Domain is as true as rumoured. But today, let my Divine Pavilion give it a try and see how capable the three Emperors of the Great Havenlaw Domain are!” The West Pavilion Lord solemnly said. Along with his words, two streaks of light had shot over from two other directions and revealed two elderly silhouettes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sleeping Emperor had clenched his fist and sucked that lump of light into his hand. As the light dissipated, it had formed into a one-meter long azure sword with a cold light flowing on the body of the sword. Ancient runes were wriggling like snakes as a cold light was circulating on the blade that even caused the space to be cracked apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a High Rank Divine Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hidden treasures here were extremely ample. Just a casual snatch and it was a High Rank Divine Artifact. If such an object was sold in an auction in the Northern Region, it would definitely attract the greed of many Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But for the Sleeping Emperor, who had reached Ninth Grade Sovereign, only a Peerless Rank Divine Artifact could move his heart and could also greatly enhance his fighting power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, there were treasures above the rank of Peerless Rank Divine Artifact. But those treasures weren’t Divine Artifacts, but Saint Artifacts. Such a peerless treasure was something that not even an Earth Sovereign could obtain. Thus, even the Sleeping Emperor had not seen one before.</span></p>

There were quite a lot of light lumps from the lake, so he did not know which one was the Spiritual Divine Artifact. With the current chaotic situation, there wasn’t any opportunity for him to look at them one by one, since it would waste too much time…</span></p>

The latter was dressed in white robes and had a warm and gentle smile on his face. But the Sleeping Emperor had sensed Spiritual Energy undulations that were not any weaker than his own coming from that person.</span></p>

They were naturally after the Great Havenlaw Domain, not letting the three Emperors have a chance at the Spiritual Divine Artifacts.</span></p>

The two of them had nodded their heads, before they headed for a certain direction and flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. The Pavilion Master has ordered us not to let your Great Havenlaw Domain touch the Spiritual Divine Liquid.” When the East Pavilion Lord saw the situation, he chuckled but there weren’t any smiles contained in his eyes. On the contrary, his eyes were filled with indifference. He gently nodded his head. The two other Pavilion Lords had directly flown out, pursuing the Sky Vulture Emperor and Spiritual Pupils Emperor.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?”</span></p>

Under that level of Spiritual Energy impact, this region had instantly become a little distorted.</span></p>

A Spiritual Energy oppression that wasn’t any weaker than the East Pavilion Lord’s had spread out.</span></p>

It looked like the Divine Pavilion was targeting their Great Havenlaw Domain on purpose. From the current looks of it, they were intending to completely obstruct the Great Havenlaw Domain from seizing Spiritual Divine Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if they thought that they could obstruct the Great Havenlaw Domain from seizing treasures just by obstructing the three Emperors, it would be a little too naïve.</span></p>

A dazzling golden light burst out from his rear and a clear and crisp cry had resounded as a pair of massive phoenix wings unfolded behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The phoenix wings flapped, which immediately sent the incoming emerald green snakes away. Immediately with a tremble of his wings, his speed had instantly surged and he had turned into a streak of light that flew out of this region, and was making his way towards the centre of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of the rock island, those with a stronger cultivation would suffer a greater suppression in Spiritual Energy. At this moment, the strength that Mu Chen would exhibit was stronger than the other Kings.</span></p>

Thus, when Mu Chen had bolted towards the centre of the lake, there were streaks of light that shot over from two directions to envelop him, making Mu Chen halt his steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen swept his glance at the two streaks of light and couldn’t help narrowing his eyes with a chill surging in them.</span></p>
