Quite a bit of teams had their faces paled as fear flashed in their eyes. The greed that filled their eyes earlier had been replaced with fear. Although the treasures were extremely tempting, their lives were more important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they would not lose their lives if they failed the challenge, they would be imprisoned for half a year. That sort of punishment was even more harsh than death.</span></p>

Even people like Wang Zhong and Wu Yingying had grave expressions. With their strength, the layers beneath the seventh level were not too hard for them. However, their motive did not stop at that level. If there were any treasures that would attract their attention, it would be the treasures from the seventh level and up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, in order to obtain those, they would have to face powerful puppets and puppets of those levels were enough to pose a threat to them.</span></p>

She knew that Mu Chen desperately needed the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi on the ninth level, the battle would be extremely dangerous. However, with Mu Chen’s character, it was impossible to get him to give up on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young girl’s eyes flickered as she tightened her grip on the Luo God Sword.</span></p>

There wasn’t any hint of emotion in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single team exchanged glances as they did not dare to move. Although those teams with decent strength could challenge those of the lower level, the failure was still too severe, which made them especially frightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen clenched his hands as light flickered in his eyes. Although he was still struggling within his heart, the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi was too important for him. If he gave it up, who knows when the next time would be for him to find it again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me challenge the ninth level puppet.” Luo Li suddenly spoke as she smiled towards Mu Chen with her hand tightly gripping the Luo God Sword, “Although the puppet would certainly be powerful, have trust in me. I can defeat it and will definitely bring that Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen was stunned from Luo Li’s words. Even Wen Qingxuan, Xu Huang and the rest were stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li plans to take the risk?</span></p>

Although it will be a little hard, I am a risky person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words contained pride. Indeed, she did have the qualification to speak such words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Captain of the team that was once ranked first, perhaps all the teams in the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament knew that Wen Qingxuan possessed extremely powerful strength, although she had yet to truly reveal them. However, no one would belittle her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me do it, I can deal with it.” Faced with Wen Qingxuan’s pride, Luo Li shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Wen Qingxuan was a little angered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the two girls were arguing, Mu Chen, who had not been talking at all, deeply inhaled a mouthful of air. Shortly after, he shut his eyes and a brief moment later, he gradually opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he opened his eyes, the struggle and hesitation within his eyes disappeared. What replaced them was a firm gaze that fell onto the peak of the Spiritual Treasure Mountain. There wasn’t anymore of the fear in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he could not determine how strong l the puppet would be on the ninth level, he knew that if he fell back here, it wouldn’t be beneficial for his cultivation. On the road to an expert, if one didn’t have the courage and confidence to strive forward, he would definitely not succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current him needed to be constantly strengthened as he still needed the strength comparable to a Heavenly Sovereign in order to save his mother from the mysterious land that even his mother feared. He had already declared that he wants to become an unrivalled expert that could protect the girl he loves, blocking out all of the storms for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His path to become an unrivalled expert had just begun, so there was no path of retreat for him!</span></p>

When he heard that Luo Li actually wanted to take the risk for him to obtain the Nine Suns Divine Lingzhi, the doubt in his heart was ruthlessly removed from his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that Luo Li had seen the struggles in his heart.</span></p>

Since when had he lost the absolute sharpness that he had in order to become strong? The real path to being an expert was not being so cautious like this and hestating. If he had lost that spirit, it would be impossible for him to break through the layers of obstruction that was holding him back from becoming an expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light surged within Mu Chen’s black pupils. He still stood quietly in the sky. However, his slender figure became as tall and towering as a mountain at this moment. In that instant, a sharp aura was emitted from that youth’s body as if it was a divine spear that was about to pierce the sky and universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan and Luo Li stopped their argument as they were a little astonished, looking at Mu Chen. Although he remained silent, they could sense the sharpened aura from the youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within that sharpness, there were also confidence and courage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a soaring eagle, even if the wind resistance was coming at it from all directions, it still chose to soar and fly high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Li dumbfoundly stared at Mu Chen’s face. The edge of the youth’s face was filled with sharpness. This made her suddenly laugh softly as she could feel the changes within Mu Chen’s heart. Truthfully, after the Great Spiritual Academy Tournament began, she sensed that Mu Chen had been more cautious with things. Although it was good to be this way, she clearly prefered the previous prideful youth more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The him before could sense the hesitation within himself. However, she did not wish to see Mu Chen fall into that kind of situation, so she willingly stood out to obtain the item that Mu Chen wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was a pity that he seemed to have sensed something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he’s not going to even give me the slightest chance to perform myself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young girl’s lips rose as her clear and crystal-like pupils were filled with a smiling expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan by the side was also looking at Mu Chen in astonishment. She was shocked with Mu Chen’s changes. When Luo Li made that previous suggestion, she was actually upset with Mu Chen in her heart. Her character wasn’t the same as Luo Li and from the way she looked at it, if Mu Chen cared about Luo Li, he would not let her to speak such words. Since he loved her, he should stand before her, no matter what, and block anything that might possibly cause any harm to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Wen Qingxuan saw Mu Chen for the first time, seeing the guy that shook Luo Li’s heart, not only was she disappointed, she was also not satisfied with him. She did not like someone that was being so cautious, she admired someone that would face forward, no matter how many difficulties there were, being arrogant and did not care too much about the cause and effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the heaven and earth was wide and vast, he could control the cloud and rain with a flip of his hand. That was the character that she admired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Qingxuan looked at Mu Chen. The current youth looked like a spear that could pierce the heavens and nothing could obstruct it from doing so. He was slowly fitting into the character that she liked. Only now, did she understand why Luo Li would fall for him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps this is the Mu Chen from the Spiritual Road.</span></p>
