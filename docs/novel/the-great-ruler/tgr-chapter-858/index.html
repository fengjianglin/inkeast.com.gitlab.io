 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the bottom of the peak sat five troops with five boundless force of Battle Will undulating above them. At this moment, the five troops were all resting and reorganising. Therefore, the offensive characteristics of the Battle Will had been retracted, appearing more gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Chen, who had insights on Battle Will, knew that the gentle appearance was just a façade. The origin of Battle Will was the Spiritual Energy and will combined from every single warrior. So when those warriors were filled with fighting spirit, the Battle Will would be able to change according to their will and be filled with offensive characteristics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s black pupils looked at the five distinguished Battle Wills and fell into his thoughts. His control over the Nine Nether Troop’s Battle Will had already reached the point of perfection. But the quantity of the Nine Nether Troop was limited. So with Mu Chen’s rising strength, he had vaguely sensed that the Battle Will of the Nine Nether Troop was gradually insufficient for him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But such a trained troop was not something that could be nurtured in a short time. Every single warrior required to grind their Spiritual Energy for a long time so that their Spiritual Energy and will would be compatible, thus fusing together. Otherwise, they would just be a scattered troop and their Battle Will wouldn’t possess any power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Comparing a thousand scattered warriors and a thousand warriors that could combine their Battle Will together, the latter could practically crush the former.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, even if Mu Chen felt that the Battle Will of the Nine Nether Troop was gradually insufficient for him, he did not think too much into it. To a Battle Formation Master, if there wasn’t the support of an elite troop, it was equivalent to the cleverest housewife without the rice to cook.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power of a Battle Formation Master originated from the troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, right now, Mu Chen had found a pretty good opportunity, the four other troops before him. The Mountain Splitting Army of the Mountain Splitting Hall, Blood Hawk Troops of the Blood Hawk Palace, Spiritual Swordsmen of the Spiritual Sword Mountain and Great Cliff Cave's Great Army…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he could cause a resonance between the four troops with his own strength, then that would show that there’s a high possibility of him commanding the Battle Will of the four other troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he had reached that point, Mu Chen’s strength would definitely reach an astonishing height. Just with the Battle Will of the Nine Nether Troop alone, he could already confront a Sixth Grade Sovereign head-on. If he could further make use of the four troop’s Battle Wills, then he wouldn’t even fear a Seventh Grade Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, he wasn’t a fool and knew that it was still impossible for him to command the Battle Will of five elite troops with his current strength, unless he had become a genuine Battle Formation Master. Otherwise, just the vast Battle Will alone could cause his will to crumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You couldn’t become a fatty in one go. So he had to take his time to achieve it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But…even if he couldn’t command them, it would prove his potential if he could cause a resonance between the troops. Perhaps then, he would be a step closer towards the mysterious Battle Formation Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But interfering with other troops was a little too far, but Mu Chen had ways to deal with the trouble that would come after it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, Mu Chen couldn’t help inhaling a mouthful of chilled air and no longer hesitated. He slowly closed his eyes and his heart rippled under the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Darkness filled his sight, but the senses of his heart had more reach. So, under Mu Chen’s senses, the five boundless Battle Wills around the mountain had also quietly undulated. There were endless bloodthirsty roars resounding, fluctuating the space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the five Battle Will oceans, there was one that Mu Chen felt extremely intimate with. It was the Nine Nether Troop’s Battle Will, but the four other Battle Wills had each occupied their own territories, like tigers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen briefly pondered, before his conscious spread out and came in contact with the four other Battle Will oceans. He only hesitated for a moment, before giving an attempt to contact them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the moment Mu Chen’s conscious came in contact with the four other Battle Wills, it had rebounded off and even attracted the subconscious rejection and offence of those Battle Wills, which made Mu Chen’s consciousness slightly tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first contact had ended in failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen tightly furrowed his brows. Those Battle Wills rejected the approaching unfamiliar conscious. If it wasn’t for the fact that there weren’t any offensive characteristics in Mu Chen’s consciousness earlier, he would have been attacked by the four other Battle Wills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those Battle Wills were too sensitive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen fell into thoughts for a long time, before his brows loosened up. After all, he was extremely experienced in the way of Battle Will, so he knew that charging his way through was impossible to command Battle Will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s heart gradually calmed down till his heart was like a still pond, before he spread his consciousness again. This time, he did not come in contact with the four Battle Will, but allowed his mind to spread out in this night sky. Thereafter, it was like a pond of water that was slightly undulated and, once again, came in contact with the four boundless Battle Wills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant of contact, Mu Chen’s body violently jolted. It was as if there were endless bloodthirsty roars that resounded in his heart. Those violent Battle Wills felt like they wanted to control his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But those yells did not pose much of a problem to Mu Chen. He was no longer a greenhorn in Battle Will, so he had steadily guarded his mind and allowed those Battle Wills to do as they wished. After a long while, those roars gradually weakened, before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those roars disappeared, Mu Chen’s consciousness that had spread out was like a fish that swam into the boundless ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His consciousness had finally entered those four vast Battle Will oceans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt like he had entered some volcanoes. The four Battle Wills had different degrees of violence as well, representing different attributes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, the Blood Hawk Troop had a heavy stench of blood, the Mountain Splitting Army had heavy slaughterings, Spiritual Swordsmen had sharpness, while the Great Troop was massive…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these attributes were related to the characteristics displayed by these troops over the years. Or perhaps it could be said that they were their styles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Chen’s consciousness had mixed into those Battle Will oceans, with endless resounded tremors striking Mu Chen’s heart. If it was an ordinary person, they would have already lost their consciousness from those Battle Will impacts and could not maintain a clear-headed state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, fortunately, Mu Chen wasn’t normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Mu Chen wasn’t in a rush to try and attempt a resonance between the troops after mixing into those Battle Wills. on the contrary, he allowed his consciousness to wander around those Battle Will oceans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a river fish that had joined a large school of fish, trying to make everything of his similar to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the most important factor was that Mu Chen did not conceal the existence of his consciousness on purpose. When his consciousness wandered around those four boundless oceans of Battle Will, the thoughts of those Battle Wills had sensed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those thoughts naturally came from the warriors of the four respective troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So when they felt that strand of consciousness from Mu Chen, there were innumerable warriors amongst the four troops that immediately opened their eyes with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, when they found foreign factors in the Battle Will of their troops, they would naturally launch attacks in an attempt to destroy it. But the invader was Mu Chen…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this period of time, Mu Chen had led the Nine Nether Troop and fought together with them, and they had also felt great envy for the astonishing power of the Spirit of Battle Will that the Nine Nether Troop could form under Mu Chen’s control. So when they felt Mu Chen’s consciousness, they did not reject him out of reflex and briefly hesitated. Furthermore, after seeing that Mu Chen had not move much, they accepted that consciousness of Mu Chen’s. After all, regardless of anything, Mu Chen was also from the Great Havenlaw Domain and could be considered as a companion.</span></p>

As the superiors of their troops, they naturally couldn’t disregard this. So, after a brief hesitation, they had still informed their superiors about this, the four Kings.</span></p>

When she appeared, the four Kings all shifted their gazes onto her. “Nine Nether King, what is King Mu trying to do?”</span></p>

After all, Mu Chen had interfered into their troops without informing them about it, which seemed a little rude.</span></p>

If King Mu wishes it, you can go ahead as you wish.” The Great Cliff King, who had always been silent, couldn’t control his laughter. In this period of time, he had witnessed the power of Spirit of Battle Will on a troop. Therefore, his eyes had been red with envy these past few days but there was nothing he could do, since there wasn’t a genius like Mu Chen amongst his subordinates. Therefore, he could only helplessly worry. So when he heard Mu Chen’s words, even with their bearing, the four Kings couldn’t help having their eyelids furiously twitch.</span></p>

But shortly after, she had knitted her brows and looked at the silhouette on the mountain.</span></p>
