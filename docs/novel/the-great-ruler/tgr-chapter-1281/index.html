 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1281 - Red Gourd</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crystallised sword had instantly pierced through space and slashed down in the direction of Gu Shihuang. This sudden attack was so tricky that even with his strength, Gu Shihuang also couldn’t avoid this attack and could only watch as the sword flew over with astonishment on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, even his soul had left his body. He could feel that the sword in Mu Chen’s hand was actually emanating an aura that made him feel terrified, an aura that belonged uniquely to Heavenly Sovereigns!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a fixed period, the owner of that sword must have been a genuine Heavenly Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So when the sword flew over, even Gu Shihuang felt terrified despite his cultivation at the Perfected Earth Sovereign Realm, since he never expected that Mu Chen would possess such a terrifying weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That crystallised sword must have surpassed the rank of a High Grade Saint Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the sword brandished down, it felt as though it couldn’t be avoided. But as an old fox, Gu Shihuang had slightly moved his head in a strange manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword streaked across his ear and slashed on his shoulder. Even with his powerful physique, Gu Shihuang felt an indescribable stinging pain coming from his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shihuang shrieked. Nearly half of his body, from his shoulder down, was sliced by that sword. Furthermore, there were crystallised flashes on his body where, even with his robust recovery as an Earth Sovereign, they showed no signs of recovering. With blood covering his body, Gu Shihuang looked incredibly pathetic at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a great shock, Gu Shihuang frantically retreated, disregarding his wound and fled over a myriad foot distance before he stopped and looked at the white-robed Mu Chen in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a pity.” The white-robed Mu Chen held onto the crystallised sword, looking at Gu Shihuang and shook his head in pity. With his main body and a clone as bait, he had attracted all of Gu Shihuang’s attention so his other clone could hide to unleash that unexpected assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outcome of it was also pretty good. Even if Gu Shihuang didn’t manage to dodge it completely, he still avoided his fatal spots. Otherwise, even if Gu Shihuang wasn’t dead at this moment, he would also have lost his fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white-robed Mu Chen shook the blood from the sword before casting a glance at the crystallised sword. He could sense a portion of the remnant energy inside disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to his estimation, this sword could probably be used two more times before it was truly useless. At that time, the Heavenly Emperor Sword would no longer possess such lethality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, Gu Shihuang’s fighting power should have been decreased by sixty or eighty percent. He’s no longer a threat.” The white-robed Mu Chen looked at the main body and the latter nodded his head before the former charged forth once more. A light flickered on the crystallised sword. Gu Shihuang was currently in his weakest state, so he definitely couldn’t let such an opportunity go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the white-robed Mu Chen charging forth, Gu Shihuang had actually retreated. He had clearly been terrified by the Heavenly Emperor Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mu Chen, who was standing on the Immortal Golden Body, saw this, he immediately controlled the Immortal Golden Body and Divine Immortal Runes rose into the sky before they launched attacks towards Gu Shihuang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shihuang, who initially had the advantage, had fallen to the lower hand. He constantly fled from the white-robed Mu Chen’s pursuit while defending against Mu Chen’s attacks — instantly surrounded by perils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Gu Shihuang fell into critical circumstances, Liang Xiesha, who was tied up by Long Xiang and Luo Li, had also sensed this and his face drastically changed. He never expected Gu Shihuang to be in such a spot…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it, that sinful child actually has such means?!” Liang Xiesha’s heart trembled with a flash of panic. If Gu Shihuang loses, then he wouldn’t be in a good situation as well, so he had to think of a way to help the latter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At this time, you better take care of yourself!” While his attention was separated, a peal of sinister laughter resounded and Long Xiang suddenly appeared before him, before throwing a jab forth. It was a jab that was accompanied by the roar of a dragon-elephant that contained the power of a myriad dragon-elephant and slammed against the barrier before Liang Xiesha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sturdy barrier shattered and Liang Xiesha was sent flying away with his face alternative between pale and green. When he finally managed to suppress the surging Spiritual Energy in his body, he saw Ling Xiang charging forth once again. Thus, he could only focus his mind on dealing with Long Xiang and Luo Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Liang Xiesha was being tied up, the Emerald Serpent Ancestor, who was trapped in the Skycirculation Meteorite Array, could only look at Gu Shihuang with a dark expression. He then occasionally gazed at the Heavenly Emperor Sword in Mu Chen’s hand with a flash of shock in his eyes. He had witnessed the white-robed Mu Chen holding onto that sword and nearly killed Gu Shihuang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This brat has too many peculiar points. He’s only a Greater Earth Sovereign, so how could he possess two clones with the same cultivation as his main body? Furthermore, that sword is definitely something that belongs to a Heavenly Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could that fellow have a Heavenly Sovereign backing him up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just thinking about this made the Emerald Serpent Ancestor’s heart go cold. He was a loner and didn’t have a powerful backing like the Ancient Buddha Clan, and if the Heavenly Sovereign behind Mu Chen showed up, even if he couldn’t find trouble with the Ancient Buddha Clan, couldn’t that Heavenly Sovereign do anything to a Perfected Earth Sovereign like him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shihuang and Liang Xiesha had the backing of the Ancient Buddha Clan, but he had nothing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn old thing; you actually dragged me into this mess. Does that brat look like someone without any backing?!” The Emerald Serpent Ancestor cursed in his heart. This situation was completely different from what Gu Shihuang had told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I cannot stay in this place. This matter is between that brat and the Ancient Buddha Clan, and there’s no need for me to meddle in this.” The Emerald Serpent Ancestor clenched his teeth and a golden talisman appeared on his head that emanated spatial fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an ancient Teleportation Talisman, something that he had obtained from the ancient ruins. As long as he used it, he would be able to break free from any dangerous situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not want to use it initially, but if Mu Chen really had a backing of a Heavenly Sovereign, then he wouldn’t be able to escape, even if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this thought, the Emerald Serpent Ancestor no longer hesitated and flicked his finger. The talisman started to blaze and an intense spatial fluctuation rippled out, forming a spatial vortex and broke apart the restraints of the Skycirculation Meteorite Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Emerald Serpent, what are you doing?!” Sensing the violent spatial fluctuation, Gu Shihuang had also noticed and he barked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Emerald Serpent Ancestor did not respond to that. He just stepped into the vortex and instantly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard!” Watching the Emerald Serpent Ancestor leave, Gu Shihuang was raging. Without the Emerald Serpent Ancestor being trapped, Ling Xi would be able to use the Spiritual Array to deal with them and facing the addition of this powerful Spiritual Array, and there wouldn’t be any hope for him, who was already facing desperate straits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His thinking wasn’t wrong. The instant when the Emerald Serpent Ancestor escaped, the Skycirculation Meteorite Array that had enveloped the entire island started to move and starlight descended onto the sky, trying to imprison him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gu Shihuang saw those starlights, he felt his scalp turning numb. This Spiritual Array could deal with a Perfected Earth Sovereign, to begin with, and if he was in his top condition, there’s nothing to fear. But not only was he heavily injured, he even had to face Mu Chen’s ferocious attacks. If he was caught up in the array, he would probably fall if Mu Chen used the sword again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just thinking about death made Gu Shihuang feel endless fear before he clenched his teeth and roared, “Brat, you’re the one that forced me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he roared, he held onto a jade strip and crushed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the jade strip was crushed, an endless spiritual luster soared into the sky and formed into a massive spatial vortex that emanated a terrifying fluctuation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this situation, Mu Chen’s face had changed. That Spiritual Energy fluctuation was deep and unfathomable. Just briefly sensing it made him feel despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenly Sovereign!” Mu Chen narrowed his eyes. He never expected that Gu Shihuang would be able to summon a Heavenly Sovereign from the Ancient Buddha Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flipping his hand, a stone talisman appeared in his hand. If the Heavenly Sovereign from the Ancient Buddha Clan truly arrived, then he would only have to use the last favor and summon the Martial Ancestor…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This commotion had also attracted Liang Xiesha’s attention. He then appeared beside Gu Shihuang and looked at the massive vortex. “Old fellow, don’t you know that the Grand Elder has spoken before that Heavenly Sovereigns are not allowed to deal with that sinful child?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t care about that much now!” Gu Shihuang clenched his teeth as he continued, “Elder Hei Guang is also from our side. We just have to hide it well from the Grand Elder.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unimaginable spiritual hand stretched out from the space and instantly dissolved those attacks before the hand enveloped the entire island.</span></p>
