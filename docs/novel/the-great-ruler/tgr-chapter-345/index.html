 <p><strong>Chapter 345 - Appearance</strong></p>
 <p>In the air above the northern square.</p>
 <p>As the space distorted into a whirlpool shape, a thin figure slowly walked out from within. At the moment when it stepped out, Spiritual Energy fluctuations that felt familiar and tyrannical to everyone rippled and undulated across the stretch of world.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the eyes of countless Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy students were all wide open as ecstasy uncontrollably erupted from within. Those Spiritual Energies were too familiar to them.</p>
 <p>“Mu Chen’s arrived!”</p>
 <p>“He’s finally here?”</p>
 <p>“It’s good now! Let’s see if those fellows from the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy dare to continue being that rampant!”</p>
 <p>Earth-shatteringly passionate and fervent voices rang out around the northern square as everyone’s faces were brimming with joy and surprise. As of now, Mu Chen’s reputation and prestige were no weaker than Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong. When the latter two were not at the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, Mu Chen’s prestige was obviously the greatest.</p>
 <p>During the final fight of the Hunting War that day, he had thoroughly cemented himself at the apex position within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy.</p>
 <p>That position was something that even He Yao was unable to strive for.</p>
 <p>“This fellow… he’s finally appeared…” Su Xuan and the rest felt as though a heavy rock had been lifted off their backs. Mu Chen’s appearance had undeniably given every student a dose of adrenaline.</p>
 <p>Beside her, He Yao’s expression started to waver between cloudy and clear. However, in the end, he did not say anything out loud. As of now, regardless of prestige or strength, Mu Chen was already above him, Even though he was unresigned, there was nothing that he could do.</p>
 <p>Within the square, Xue Shi stared at the figure that had stepped out from the spatial whirlpool across the horizon with faintly narrowed eyes. From the passionate and fervent voices that rang out of his surroundings, he was able to realise the identify of the latter.</p>
 <p><em>This is Mu Chen, 3rd Rank on the Heavenly Rankings?</em></p>
 <p>After realising that, a cold laugh rang out from Xue Shi. Indeed, he wanted to see exactly how capable the 3rd Rank on the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Heavenly Rankings was to actually inspire such confidence in them.</p>
 <p>The entire square was enveloped by this passionate and fervent atmosphere. This caused Mu Chen, who had appeared in the air, to faintly feel some bafflement. Just an instant ago, he had just exited his long and deep state of training…</p>
 <p>However, after leaving his training state of mind, without even having the opportunity to say his thanks to the bald old man, the latter had shattered and cracked space apart, before throwing him in.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he had appeared at this location.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>Mu Chen muttered with a slightly wrinkled forehead as he looked towards the northern square below him. After undergoing closed-state training for over a month, there shouldn’t be any big incidents happening in the academy, right? Why was it so lively down there?</p>
 <p>Mu Chen’s gaze swept across the northern square below him. In the next instant, a chill suddenly erupted from within his eyes.</p>
 <p>He had spotted Luo Li standing below the square. Currently, eye-piercing blood was dripping from the latter’s jade-like hands.</p>
 <p>Luo Li’s injured?</p>
 <p>A wave of anger flashed within Mu Chen’s eyes as his figure instantly shot forward, before appearing before Luo Li. Faintly frowning, he asked in a low and deep voice, “What happened?”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the appearance of Mu Chen, a shadow of happiness flashed within Luo Li’s eyes. Gently wiping away the blood stains on her hand, she replied with a faint smile, “It’s just a small injury, nothing of any importance.”</p>
 <p>“Who did it?” Mu Chen asked in a deep voice. As of now, there were not that many people who dare to provoke them within this Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, right? Could it be He Yao? Hadn’t that fellow fought enough?</p>
 <p>“I did it.” At this moment, an indifferent voice rang out from close by.</p>
 <p>Slowly turning around, Mu Chen looked towards the square, and imprinted the youth with blood-red eyes, who was clad in blood-red robes and standing with his hands behind his back, within his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Mu Chen asked while his forehead faintly wrinkled up. The person before him was extremely unfamiliar, and he had never seen such a person within the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy before.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>From a short distance away, Su Xuan shot over, before descending beside Mu Chen. In a low voice, she explained the whole story of what happened to him. As she continued her recount, Mu Chen’s expression grew increasingly ugly.</p>
 <p>This was especially so the moment when he heard that the youth with blood-red eyes before him had used such a despicable method to cause Luo Li to lose her concentration, injuring her shoulder and forcing her out of the square. As of now, the expression on his face was as dark and overcast as a thunderstorm.</p>
 <p>“Sorry. We’ve originally planned to not let Luo Li get entangled with this. However, we truly had no one else to rely on. Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong had temporarily left the academy, while you have been missing…” said Su Xuan with some regret.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister Su Xuan, I’m also a student of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. Protecting its name is also my duty,” Luo Li’s voice gently interrupted Su Xuan’s apology.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen nodded his head faintly, while his originally dark and overcast expression slowly returned to calmness at this moment. With a soft voice, he said, “You two step back of first. Next, let me take over.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Mu Chen was that calm, while having such chilling intent gushing out from his voice, Su Xuan and Luo Li both knew that the former had become angry. Next, he would take action.</p>
 <p>“Careful, he’s a member of the Blood God Clan, one of the four God Clans in the Western Heavenly World,” reminded Luo Li. Although this Xue Shi had used some despicable methods, anyone who neglected his strength due to this might have to pay serious consequences.</p>
 <p>Hearing her reminder, Mu Chen gently nodded his head. Blood God Clan, huh? Although they’re influential fellows, they didn’t have the qualifications to extend to such a place. Since they’d extended to such a place, Mu Chen didn’t mind to chopping this extension off.</p>
 <p>Due to Luo Li, Mu Chen did not have the slightest bit of favorable impressions towards the other three God Clans in the Western Heavenly World.</p>
 <p>Luo Li and Su Xuan proceeded to retreat, leaving Mu Chen alone, standing in the square. Upon seeing this scene, the atmosphere within the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy instantly flared up and became more fervent.</p>
 <p>“Brother Mu, beat that wretch to death!”</p>
 <p>“Make them scram out of our Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy with their tails between their legs!</p>
 <p>“…… ”</p>
 <p>Various kinds of voices and words rushed towards the sky. Those students from the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy all appeared to be psyched up, since all of them appeared to be emotional and excited.</p>
 <p>The students of the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy looked at each other. Obviously, they had never imagined that the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy, who had all looked sullen and were about to die, would change and have such confidence.</p>
 <p>Could it be due to that youth by the name of Mu Chen?</p>
 <p>They casted their doubtful gazes towards the youth, who was slowly walking towards the square. He’s that young? At that age, he obviously didn’t have the look of an elite student that had a bountiful experience.</p>
 <p>On the chief podium, Fei Qingsong faintly narrowed his eyes as he stared at the figure of the youth. With a smile, he said, “Is this Mu Chen person the 3rd Rank on your Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy’s Heavenly Rankings? However, his strength…seems to be far from enough.”</p>
 <p>With his eyesight, he was naturally able to tell that the current Mu Chen had not even reached the stage of Heavenly Completion Stage. Seemingly more than half of the Top Ten ranks of the Heavenly Rankings were even stronger than him.</p>
 <p>With a faint smile, Dean Tai Cang replied, “There are times when looking only at the cover would cause one to suffer a crushing defeat.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>Fei Qingsong’s eyebrows jumped, before saying with a smile, “Then, I really have to see exactly what capabilities this Mu Chen has…he’s the 3rd Rank on the Heavenly Rankings, right? Haha. Dean Tai Cang, if you are to lose again, you might not be able to say anything more. As for Shen Cangsheng and Li Xuantong, I think that Xue Shi and their group would compare notes with them in the future…”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Dean Tai Cang smiled, without saying anything in response, and cast his gaze that was filled with interest towards the youth on the square. As of now, the latter seemed to be much more stronger than a month ago. However, he did not know if this time, would the latter be able to fill the entire Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy with shock once again?</p>
 <p>Under the fervent atmosphere, as well as the doubtful gazes of the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy, Mu Chen walked onto the square and stood at a distance not far from Xue Shi. At this moment, those pair of black eyes radiated with an indifferent chilling glint.</p>
 <p>“The 3rd Rank of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy doesn’t seem to be as strong as I’ve expected,” said Xue Shi as he stared at Mu Chen. He was unable to feel any Spiritual Energy fluctuations radiating from the latter’s body that was comparable to his own.</p>
 <p>“You should not have injured her,” said Mu Chen slowly as his pupils faintly drooped down.</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>Xue Shi’s eyebrows were faintly raised up. Staring at Mu Chen with his blood-red eyes, he smiled and said, “She truly is very formidable. If she used her true power, even I might not be her match. However, she’s still somewhat too soft-hearted. Even I am easily able to shake her mind…That is her weakness.”</p>
 <p>“Therefore, I’ll have you pay some price for that.” Mu Chen seemed to not care about Xue Shi’s voice. Minding his own business, his voice softly rang out.</p>
 <p>“Haha…”</p>
 <p>Xue Shi gave a smile, one that contained thick bloodthirstiness. Tilting his head to stare at Mu Chen, he replied, “Just based on you? Who do you think you are?!”</p>
 <p>As his last words rang out, the smile on Xue Shi’s face had completely disappeared, being replaced by a cold and sinister expression. He dreaded Luo Li, and, therefore, used that underhand method against her. However, who did the fellow in front of him think he was…daring to be pretentious in front of him!</p>
 <p>“You’re looking to die!”</p>
 <p>The blood-red colour within Xue Shi’s eyes intensified, as blood-red Spiritual Energy that blotted the skies swept out from him. A thick smell of blood permeated the skies, while strong Spiritual Energy pressure came enveloping over. Compared to before, this was even stronger.</p>
 <p>Obviously, this Xue Shi already had the intent to kill.</p>
 <p>Outside of the square, Su Xuan and the rest had grave expressions on their faces. The strength of this Xue Shi seemed to be even stronger than Gu Tianyan by a sliver. They truly didn’t know exactly how Mu Chen would deal with him. After all, this time won’t be a friendly comparison of notes, like last time.</p>
 <p>For the sake of achieving victory in this fight, both sides would use any methods.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Under the pressure from the blood-red Spiritual Energy that blotted the skies, Mu Chen slowly exhaled a clump of white air. Raising his head, black lightning seemed to gush out from the depths of his black eyes.</p>
 <p>Abruptly clenching his fists tightly, Spiritual Energy similarly erupted from his body without the slightest restraint.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Burning with black flames, Spiritual Energy akin to smoke plumes gushed out and rushed across the horizon. Pervading out, without caring about the pressure coming from the blood-red Spiritual Energy, it shot straight up like a pillar of light, with nothing that could shake it.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase!</p>
 <p>Clamoring instantly arose from the entire square, with the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy students gawking and feeling shocked first. In the next moment, mocking arcs appeared, bit by bit, on the corners of their mouths.</p>
 <p>How exactly did someone become the 3rd Rank of the Heavenly Rankings with such strength?</p>
 <p>Their gazes turned to mockery and ridicule as they looked towards the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy. However, to their surprise, they saw that the students of the Northern Heavens Spiritual Academy were using mocking gazes to stare back at them, as though rejoining in the misfortune that was about to befall the Ancient Cauldron Spiritual Academy students.</p>
 <p><em>This group of idiots. They dared to even send a Heavenly Transformation Stage Late Phase person up. They’re truly asking for trouble…</em></p>
 <p><em>“This group of morons…when Mu Chen was at the Heavenly Transformation Stage Initial Phase, he’s already able to fight equally with Senior Brother Gu Tianyan…</em></p>
 <p>The silent words in the students’ hearts erupted out at this moment. However, no one spoke them out. As of now, the atmosphere was subtly causing people to feel comical.</p>
