 <p>Chapter 8: A Pair of Snake Mother and Daughter</p>
 <p>At Ou Xiang <em>yuan</em>[1. Yuan: part of a residence], Murong Tai softly comforted Zheng Min who’s full of tears.</p>
 <p>“All is well, my darling. The moment you cry, old master's, my heart really hurts!”</p>
 <p>“Old master is prejudiced! See how Xin e<em>r’s </em>[2. Er: term of endearment]face is hurt! The <em>double seven festival </em>is just around the corner. What do you wat Xin e<em>r</em>&nbsp;to do?! Not long ago, Anyang w<em>angfei </em>[3. Wangfei: main wife of the prince of first rank] praised our Xin e<em>r, </em>saying that she is intelligent. Now she looked like this, how will Xin e<em>r </em>go see people at the double seven festival? Old master, if this time you do not punish Qing <em>er</em>, this concubine will be unhappy!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Double seven festival is the Chinese valentine which fell on the 7<sup>th</sup> of July of the lunar calendar</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Zheng Min saw that Murong Tai came to her first, naturally she was happy.</p>
 <p>Although Murong Qing Lian was a talent at martial arts, but women, after all, had to marry. Men wouldn’t like such a strong woman. Since ancient times it was always the hero who saves the beauty. Never had it been the beauty who saves the hero. What kind of joke was that?!</p>
 <p>Zheng Min had full confidence in her daughter. Since Murong Xue Lian became Imperial Noble Consort, her daughter Murong Xin Lian’s looks were also not bad. Not to mention that the main wife Li Qiu Shui was now staying at a temple to pray and didn’t ask for the details about the outside world. Naturally, there was no one to stop her daughter’s road to the wealth.</p>
 <p>“Alright, don’t cry anymore. First, cure Xin <em>er’s </em>face, then we will talk!”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai took out a small box of creams.</p>
 <p>“This is Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>[4. Gongzi: young master]Jade Lotus cream. I took it back from Xue Lian. First, let Xin Lian use it! Don’t leave scars, otherwise there’ll be trouble!”</p>
 <p>The moment she heard strange doctor Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>Jade Lotus cream, Zheng Min quickly took it. She opened the box and a pleasant aroma came out.</p>
 <p>“This is really a good thing!”</p>
 <p>“It is, Xue Lian only got a total of two boxes. Now this box is Xin Lian’s. Let her make her face look good again!”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai patiently coaxed Zheng Min for a while. Before he went away, he touched her face and then hastily rushed to Lan Xiang <em>yuan</em>, where Liu Yan Zhi lived.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Tai’s plump body disappear, Zheng Min humphed coldly. She took the Jade Lotus cream and applied it evenly on Murong Xin Lian’s face.</p>
 <p>“Mother, father still cares more about fourth little sister.”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian lowered her head. The long eyelashes blocked the emotions in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Xin <em>er</em>, remember, no matter how much grievances you suffer, be sure to endure. You are smarter than Qing Lian and also more beautiful than her. In the future, you will marry better than her!”</p>
 <p>Without a son, Zheng Min could only rely on Murong Xin Lian. So, seeing Murong Xin Lian suffer grievances, her heart was also in pain.</p>
 <p>“Mother, I want to be Jing w<em>angfei</em>! I want to marry Longze Jing Tian!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Zheng Min mention marriage, Murong Xin Lian suddenly raised her head. Her watery eyes sparkled with a strange light.</p>
 <p>“Why is it that that rubbish Murong Qi Qi who’s good at nothing can directly marry Jing w<em>ang </em>[5. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] and become w<em>angfei?</em>! I’m not reconciled, mother, I’m really not reconciled. Her status is just nobler than mine, but what capabilities does she have?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s hands clenched into fists.</p>
 <p>“Mother, today Qing Lian sarcastically told me that I’m from a concubine and in the future, I can only be a concubine. Mother, don’t you know that at that moment I really wanted to kill her! I really hate ah…….</p>
 <p>Listening to Murong Xin Lian, Zheng Min’s eyes filled with tears. Without a son, in this household her spine was a lot softer than Liu Yan Zhi. Normally, Liu Yan Zhi mocked and ridiculed her and spoke words with thorns. All of that she could forget. Now even Murong Qing Lian was humiliating her darling daughter, making Zheng Min grit her teeth from hate.</p>
 <p>“Xin <em>er, </em>mother won’t let you suffer grievances anymore. Don’t you want to marry Longze Jing Tian and want to be Jing w<em>angfei</em>? I have a way!”</p>
 <p>Zhen Min’s words made Murong Xin Lian’s mood&nbsp; turn good&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">immediately</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">. She grabbed Zheng Min’s hand and began to shake it.</span></p>
 <p>“Mother, is what you said true? But their marriage has been bestowed by the emperor. What good way do you have to let Jing w<em>ang </em>marry me? Daughter absolutely cannot be the small one. Being bullied by that rubbish Murong Qi Qi, I might as well die. Mother, if I can marry Longze Jing Tian and become w<em>angfei</em>, even in my dreams I will wake up laughing!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian like this, Zheng Min knew her daughter had really put Longze Jing Tian in her heart.</p>
 <p>That <em>wangye</em> was good at martial arts, handsome and besides he might become the crown prince. In the future, he might even become the emperor. Then won’t Murong Xin Lian be the mother of the world, the empress…….</p>
 <p>Thinking about Murong Xin Lian’s beautiful future, Zheng Min gritted her teeth and her heart gave birth to a deadly trap. Murong Qi Qi, since you are blocking my daughter’s road to wealth, then don’t blame me for being ruthless!</p>
 <p>Zheng Min whispered a few words in Murong Xin Lian’s ear. Hearing her mother’s words, Murong Xin Lian muzzled a cry.</p>
 <p>“Mother, is this alright? Will destroying Murong Qi Qi’s reputation let Jing <em>wang&nbsp;</em>break off the engagement? But where would we find a man?”</p>
 <p>“Man, isn’t there one here?!”</p>
 <p>Zheng Min’s gentle face flashed a hint of viciousness.</p>
 <p>Wasn’t it because Liu Yan Zhi had given birth to the only son of Murong household that she had been so loved by Murong Tai?! She’d also relied on the fact that she had a son to fall back on and acted as if she was superior. Normally, she gave Zheng Min much anger!</p>
 <p>If Liu Yan Zhi’s darling son Murong Jun appeared on third miss Murong Qi Qi’s bed, this brother and sister affair, then not only would Murong Qi Qi be ruined but also Murong Jun would be ruined! She’d like to see if by that time Liu Yan Zhi could still laugh!</p>
 <p>“Mother, this plan is really good. One stone killing two birds! That Murong Jun is always looking in secret at daughter, really disgusting. If we can get rid of both of them, then it couldn’t be better!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian knew what Zheng Min was thinking, she immediately said good.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi, you can go to hell! You actually dare to steal my man. I’ll let you know my power! That year, the fact that you didn’t die was because you were lucky. This time, I want you to feel that living was more painful than death! Take your noble status and go to hell!</p>
 <p>That pair of eyes of Murong Xin Lian which looked similar to that of Zheng Min, at this moment, along with her mother, were flashing vicious lights. The two of them were like two poisonous snakes. Their mouths revealed cruel smiles...</p>
 <p>At Lan Xiang <em>yuan</em>, Murong Tai didn’t take long before he appeased this pair of mother and daughter.</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian’s martial arts was higher than Murong Xin Lian’s, which was why she wasn’t as wounded as Murong Xin Lian. She’d just received superficial wounds. Murong Tai promised to give her a treasure sword. So, he recovered his youngest daughter’s heart.</p>
 <p>As for Liu Yan Zhi, the best way to appease her was in bed. Murong Tai always believed in fighting at the front of the bed, making up at the end of the bed. So he didn’t say anything more and directly pulled Liu Yan Zhi for a few rounds. When the beauty was lying breathless in his arms, Murong Tai knew that today’s matter had passed like this.</p>
 <p>The next few days, the prime minister's mansion was very quiet. Murong Qi Qi was ‘honestly’ staying in Cui Zhu <em>yuan </em>to ‘reflect’. Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian also didn’t go out. They quietly hid in their <em>yuans </em>to recuperate.</p>
 <p>Ten days later, Murong Xin Lian’s Fei Cui appeared at Cui Zhu <em>yuan</em>. She invited Murong Qi Qi to go admire the full moon at Hu Xin pavilion tonight.</p>
 <p>“Admire the moon? Don’t want to go! I’m still shutting myself up to reflect over my mistakes!”</p>
 <p>With just moving a toe, you’d know that, that woman had bad intentions. Recently, Murong Qi Qi was really busy. She had no time to accompany that little miss at playing schemes, so she directly rejected Fei Cui.</p>
