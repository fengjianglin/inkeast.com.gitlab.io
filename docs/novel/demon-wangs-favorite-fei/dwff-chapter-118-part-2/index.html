 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 118 The truth is so cruel (2) part 2</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Your majesty, long time no see!” Li Qiu Shui’s smile was very generous and the way she talked with Wanyan Lie was like talking to an old friend. That kind of relaxation made people couldn’t help but feel surprised.</p>
 <p>“What did you come for?” Wanyan Lie had no interest to reminisce the old times with Li Qiu Shui. The face which originally had a smile, immediately stiffened. Coldness emerged on his face, making Li Bing and Lin Ke Xin who were sitting at the right and left of him, feel cold.</p>
 <p>“I came to see my daughter, ah!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian was also surprised at the way Li Qiu Shui spoke with Wanyan Lie. In the morning, Li Qiu Shui suddenly appeared. She had an expression of missing her daughter very much and begged Longze Jing Tian to bring her in the palace to see Murong Qi Qi once. So, he brought Li Qiu Shui to the palace. He didn’t expect that this Li Qiu Shui an Wanyan Lie knew each other.</p>
 <p>Li Qiu Shui said she came to see Murong Qi Qi. Wanyan Lie didn’t believe it. Murong Qi Qi also didn’t believe it.</p>
 <p>From the smile on Li Qiu Shui’s face, Murong Qi Qi sensed a plot. Could she(LQS) had come for her (MQQ) history? Thinking about those words Li Qiu Shui reminded her before she (MQQ) left (Xi Qi) and also those unclean things on the wedding dress; could it be that she had been waiting for this day?</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, take down your Water Moon Mirror!” Li Qiu Shui looked at Murong Qi Qi. In her eyes were no longer the love from before, instead there was a smile with coldness and ridicule.</p>
 <p>“Water Moon Mirror?” Hearing this, not only Wanyan Lie, but Dongfang Lan was also startled. The Water Moon Mirror was Wanyan Ming Yue loved possession. In the past, Wanyan Ming Yue often used the Water Moon Mirror to cover her true face to be able to sneak out and play. Why was this treasure at Murong Qi Qi’s?</p>
 <p>Feng Cang felt odd at Li Qiu Shui’s words. He had heard about Water Moon Mirror. He also saw it in the past. However, didn’t this thing disappear with Wanyan Ming Yue’s death? Why was it at Murong Qi Qi’s? Could it be that Murong Qi Qi’s face was fake? What he saw was fake?</p>
 <p>Seeing the doubts in Feng Cang’s eyes, Murong Qi Qi laughed once bitterly. Originally, she thought about hiding it from Feng Cang. The longer she could keep it a secret, the better. She didn’t take Li Qiu Shui, this accident into account.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>[1. Wang/wangye: this king, I, used by the prince of first rank], I didn’t deliberately keep it a secret from you <em>(TLNote: uhm…you did)</em>!” Murong Qi Qi’s eyes were full of guilt, making Feng Cang feel heartache.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, don’t be afraid. You have me!”</p>
 <p>Inside Li Qiu Shui’s eyes, Feng Cang’s gentleness was a great mockery. “Qi Qi, take down your Water Moon Mirror. Let your (maternal) grandmother, your (maternal) uncle, right, and your biological big brother see your true appearance!”</p>
 <p>Listening till here, Murong Qi Qi’s heart sank. She completely went cold. Sure enough, sure enough it was like this! She didn’t expect her small trace of hope had been buried alive by Li Qiu Shui.</p>
 <p>The people were more puzzled after hearing Li Qiu Shui say that. Seeing that Murong Qi Qi still didn’t take down the Water Moon Mirror, Li Qiu Shui’s hands flew at Murong Qi Qi’s face and wanted to seize the thing on her face.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi had long been prepared for Li Qiu Shui’s sudden attack. Just as Li Qiu Shui’s hands was about to fell on her face, Murong Qi Qi grabbed Li Qiu Shui’s hands and fixed her there.</p>
 <p>That Murong Qi Qi knew martial arts was outside of Li Qiu Shui’s expectation. Seeing the coldness in Murong Qi Qi’s eyes, Li Qiu Shui laughed, “What, you don’t dare to take it off? Be good! Let mother help you take down the Water Moon Mirror!”</p>
 <p>“You’re not my mother!” Murong Qi Qi kicked Li Qiu Shui chest. Li Qiu Shui backed and fell at a distance.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough!” Her chest felt pain. Li Qiu Shui coughed blood. “You’re indeed Feng Xie and Ming Yue’s daughter. You actually lied to everyone about having martial arts!”</p>
 <p>“What about that I have martial arts?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi stood up like a gallant martyr and walked to the centre of the hall.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter, ah?!” Lin Ke Xin was muddleheaded. “What (maternal) grandmother and uncle? What are you talking about?!”</p>
 <p>“Let her say it, ah! Hahaha! When she takes down the Water Moon Mirror, you would see and would understand everything!” While Li Qiu Shui was laughing, the corners of her mouth were bleeding. However, she seemed as if she couldn’t feel the pain. It was as if now was her happiest moment.</p>
 <p>Seeing that everyone was looking at her, Murong Qi Qi knew that she couldn’t cover this matter up today. It seemed that she could only face reality.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi raised her hand and removed the Water Moon Mirror from her face, revealing her original face.</p>
 <p>“Ah…” The crutch with a dragon head in Dongfang Lan’s hand fell with a ‘bang’ on the ground. “Ming Yue, you are, Ming Yue…”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie was also stunned. He collected so many women who looked like Wanyan Ming Yue, but none could be compared to the person in front of him. That is Ming Yue’s face, that is Ming Yue’s brows, that is Ming Yue’s nose, that is Ming Yue’s lips, even the aura from her body was Ming Yue’s…</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing…”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s heart beat very fast. So, so, it was like this… “No wonder you refused…” Feng Cang didn’t finish his words, but he and Murong Qi Qi understood the meaning of those words.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>, I also only got to know the day before yesterday and didn’t keep it deliberately from you.” Murong Qi Qi was afraid that Feng Cang would misunderstood and quickly explained, “I truly didn’t do it intentionally.”</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha!” Seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, Li Qiu Shui laughed the hardest. She was also the happiest person, “Feng Xie! Did you see?! Your daughter married your son! Hahaha! Your biological daughter became you son’s wife, did you see?!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiu Shui’s words answered the questions in everyone’s heart.</p>
 <p>“What did you say? You said, she’s Ming Yue’s daughter?” Wanyan Lie rushed to her and grabbed her hand, “That child is still alive, isn’t it? You took away that child? That child is her, isn’t it?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! That’s right! I took her away! I strangled my own daughter and let her take the place of my daughter to be raised in Murong household. I let her get the surname Murong and let her become the third miss Murong! Hahaha!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiu Shui laughed till she cried. She looked viciously at Murong Qi Qi. All her emotions could only be described with the word ‘hate’. “You’re not my biological daughter. Your father was Bei Zhou’s great general Feng Xie. Your birth mother is Wanyan Ming Yue. Now, you know your identity!”</p>
 <p>“Why? Why did you do it?” Although she guessed that perhaps this matter had something to do with Li Qiu Shui, but Murong Qi Qi couldn’t find the reason why Li Qiu Shui hates Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Could there be something more inside this?</p>
 <p>“Why? You ask me why?”</p>
 <p>As if she heard the biggest joke, Li Qiu Shui struggled and got away from Wanyan Lie’s grab. She wiped the blood from her mouth and walked to Murong Qi Qi, “Because Wanyan Ming Yue stole the man I loved! Because Feng Xie chose Wanyan Ming Yue and abandoned me! Because they were like a couple of immortals. Because they were happy making me envy and hate them!”</p>
