 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 78 Feng Cang’s poison (2)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Jin Mo rushed towards Murong Qi Qi like lightning. The branch in his hand has long been changed into silver needles. ‘Sou, sou, sou……’ they flew towards Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Jin Mo making&nbsp;his attack let Ruyi feel sweat for Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t know what had happened, but Jin Mo followed <em>wangye</em>[1. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank] for ten years. He wouldn’t lie. Besides, Murong Qi Qi indeed&nbsp;knows&nbsp;martial arts. This was something they didn’t expect. It made Ruyi believe Jin Mo’s words even more.</p>
 <p>It’s just that, saying Murong Qi Qi was Xi Qi’s spy, Ruyi didn’t believe that either. After all, getting along for such a long time, he felt that Murong Qi Qi was a good person. At least, her heart must’ve moved for <em>wangye</em> and she also didn’t look like the bad guys. Now that Jin Mo had changed the branch for silver needles; he obviously had the intention to kill, making Ruyi feel anxious.</p>
 <p>If Jin Mo really slipped and killed Murong Qi Qi, what would&nbsp;Feng Cang do when he wakes up? Ruyi saw very clearly <em>wangye’s </em>good feelings towards Murong Qi Qi these past few days. Ever since this little <em>wangfei</em>[2. Wangfei: consort of the prince]&nbsp;showed up, the smiles appeared a lot more on <em>wangye. </em>&nbsp;Even Ruyi, who had been at his side for so long, was surprised.</p>
 <p><em>Wangye</em> truly loves Murong Qi Qi! Ruyi was very sure of this. No matter what Murong Qi Qi’s background was, if Jin Mo really kills Murong Qi Qi today, then no matter if it’s intentional or not, when <em>wangye </em>wakes up, he would be in pain and maybe he would also kill Jin Mo……</p>
 <p>If Jin Mo died, then there would be no one left who could treat Feng Cang’s disease. By then, what could they do? Should they just watch <em>wangye </em>die?!</p>
 <p>In just one moment, Ruyi’s brain experienced a strong struggle. No! He must stop Jin Mo! No matter who Murong Qi Qi is, it’s <em>wangye </em>who should make the decision!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Ruyi intended to rescue Murong Qi Qi. However, those silver needles were only an inch away from Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi didn’t dodge or hide. She seemed to not know that danger was coming at her.</p>
 <p>“Be careful, ah……”</p>
 <p>With no&nbsp;time left to use an attack to stop, Ruyi could only shout to&nbsp;warn Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Jin Mo was surprised that Ruyi was helping Murong Qi Qi. It also let him have a more ‘profound’ understanding of Murong Qi Qi. Ruyi followed Feng Cang since an early age, so&nbsp;how did Murong Qi Qi bribe him in such a short period?! This woman&nbsp;was indeed a devil!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Jin Mo’s attacks became more ruthless.</p>
 <p>“Ah……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi still didn’t move. Only when the silver needles were almost in her eyes, did she wave her hands and let the silver needles enter her sleeves. She then turned her hands and shot the silver needles back at Jin Mo.</p>
 <p>One attack, ‘falling flowers, flowing water’, made Jin Mo stunned. By the time&nbsp;he came out of the daze, the silver needles had already pierced his shoulders. He felt a burst of numbness. Oh no, there’s anaesthetic on the needles! The numbness on his body immediately let Jin Mo think&nbsp;about the anesthetic Murong Qi Qi had previously smeared on the dagger.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? Why do you know ‘falling flowers, flowing water’?!”</p>
 <p>He gritted his teeth while pulling out the needles from his body. Jin Mo’s eyes locked with Murong Qi Qi’s. This ‘falling flowers, flowing water’ was his master, the holy doctor's unique attack. Why does Murong Qi Qi know it? What’s going on?</p>
 <p>“Ah, my master taught me!”</p>
 <p>“Who is your master?”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo was even more puzzled. Master didn’t accept female disciples. Impossible. Murong Qi Qi and him absolutely didn’t come from the same master!</p>
 <p>Seeing that Jin Mo didn’t believe it, Murong Qi Qi took out a bone needle.</p>
 <p>“Jin Mo, do you recognize this?”</p>
 <p>“Rhinoceros needle!”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo recognized the bone needle in Murong Qi Qi’s hand. This was master’s most treasured thing. It was actually in Murong Qi Qi’s hands! This was too incredible!</p>
 <p>“Where did you steal it from?!”</p>
 <p>“Jin Mo, in your heart, is my character so bad?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi humphed coldly. Now she knew how much prejudice Jin Mo held against her.</p>
 <p>“No wonder the old man doesn’t like you. You really are not likeable. Fortunately, in the end, old man got such a treasure apprentice like me. That’s why he passed me the rhinoceros needle.”</p>
 <p>“Old man?!”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo was completely startled. If what Murong Qi Qi said was true, then she's his junior sister. She actually called master old man! So rude! So disrespectful!</p>
 <p>“Of course.”</p>
 <p>On Murong Qi Qi’s finger appeared an ancient silver ring.</p>
 <p>Seeing the silver ring, the doubts in Jin Mo’s heart disappeared. He immediately knelt on one knee. That ring was the symbol for the status of the holy doctor. Now, Jin Mo definitely knew&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi’s identity. She was Lian <em>gongzi</em>, the one who was nicknamed strange doctor, his junior brother.</p>
 <p>Before, in the letter master wrote to him, he said clearly that he passed down his legacy to his (JM) little junior brother Lian <em>gongzi. </em>He also said that seeing the silver ring was like seeing him. Only after Murong Qi Qi took out the silver ring, did Jin Mo believe her.</p>
 <p>“Yo, eldest senior brother, why are you giving me such a big bow?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi slowly walked to Jin Mo and swung the silver ring in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Just now, didn’t you not believe me? I had to take out master’s token for you to believe me. It seems that you’re quite afraid of the old man, ah!”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo understood that Murong Qi Qi was making fun of him, but he no longer talked back. Just now, he treated Murong Qi Qi like that. Why shouldn’t he let her lessen her anger?</p>
 <p>It’s just, Jin Mo never thought that Lian <em>gongzi </em>would be a woman. Besides, he believed that he (Lian) was living at the ends of the earth, but actually he's right under their noses and was Murong Qi Qi! This is really too surprising! Master praised Lian <em>gongzi</em> very much and boasted that he was a rare genius of hundred years.</p>
 <p>Originally, he thought that strange doctor Lian <em>gongzi</em>&nbsp;appeared and disappeared unpredictably. Jin Mo never expected Lian <em>gongzi</em>&nbsp;having this identity and living so low-key at his side.</p>
 <p><em>Small obscurity&nbsp;is like an open space. Middle obscurity&nbsp;is like a market. Big obscurity is like the imperial morning court. </em>She played out this poem vividly. Who would know that the princess who had come to&nbsp;form a marriage alliance, princess Zhao Yang, the rubbish in the eyes of people, was also the strange doctor Lian <em>gongzi </em>whose fame shook the world! Hiding at Feng Cang’s place was indeed an excellent plan.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li>Meaning of the poem: the greater the genius, the&nbsp;more concealed he/she is</li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ruyi was far away, so he didn’t hear Jin Mo and Murong Qi Qi’s talk, but after seeing Jin Mo kneel in front of Murong Qi Qi, Ruyi was somewhat shocked.</p>
 <p>This evil doctor, aside from w<em>angye, </em>didn’t acknowledge anyone. Just now, he shouted that he wanted to kill Murong Qi Qi, but now he's acting like this. In the end, what&nbsp;had happened? Inside Ruyi’s heart appeared a big question mark. If it wasn’t because he needed to take care of Feng Cang, he would’ve certainly gone over to see what’s happening!</p>
 <p>Only after letting Jin Mo kneel for a while longer, did the anger inside Murong Qi Qi’s heart subside. Although Jin Mo was somewhat unreasonable, but he's extremely respectful towards master. This silver ring was originally a keepsake of a doctor. Seeing the ring was like seeing master. This concept had been deeply ingrained inside Jin Mo’s head!</p>
 <p>“Eldest senior brother,<em>&nbsp;</em>get up! The ground is cold.”</p>
 <p>After putting away the silver ring, Murong Qi Qi personally helped Jin Mo up.</p>
 <p>Knowing that Murong Qi Qi did it intentionally, but Jin Mo could only smile bitterly. Before, he gave her many bad faces, he didn’t think that she would have remembered them all. Indeed, it’s preferable to offend a vile character than to offend a woman. Especially women with such ability like Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“I, should I call you little junior sister or should I call you princess?”</p>
 <p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi once again, Jin Mo felt somewhat uncomfortable. Since Murong Qi Qi was his little junior sister<em>, </em>then she wouldn’t harm Feng Cang. Thinking back of those misunderstandings, Jin Mo felt somewhat embarrassed. He misunderstood a good person! However, he cannot be blamed entirely, ah. If Murong Qi Qi made her identity known earlier on, then these misunderstandings wouldn’t have happened at all.</p>
 <p>“Princess.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi raised her head, narrowed her eyes and looked at Jin Mo.</p>
 <p>“Eldest senior brother<em>, </em>now you should tell me the things about Feng Cang. Fetal poison, cold poison and <em>gu </em>poison; who did it?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo laughed bitterly and shook his head.</p>
 <p>“I’m a doctor. My task is to heal the dying. As for those things that happened in the past, there’s no need to know them clearly!”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo saying that made Murong Qi Qi want to pry his head open and see what he was thinking. Knowing the patient’s past would enable them to understand the mind of the one who poisoned him better and also let them have more information about the antidote and help them more with detoxification. Could it be that he didn’t know this?</p>
 <p>“Does senior brother want to conceal it, or does senior brother really not know?”</p>
 <p>“Since you want to know, why don’t you go ask <em>wangye </em>in person?”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo’s voice had just faded when they heard Ruyi’s voice: “<em>Wangfei</em>, mister, <em>wangye</em> has woken up.”</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em> woke up!”</p>
 <p>The moment Murong Qi Qi heard this, her heart jumped up from joy. This was the best news she'd ever heard. She immediately rushed to Feng Cang. Before she ran away, she said to Jin Mo: “Asking eldest senior brother to help me keep my identity a secret! Thank you!”</p>
 <p>After arriving in front of Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi’s eyes looked in the once again black eyes of Feng Cang. Excited, she suddenly flew into Feng Cang’s arms.</p>
 <p>“Feng Cang, how are you feeling? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?”</p>
 <p>Must say that Jin Mo’s skills were excellent. Feng Cang was now restored to his original appearance and did not look&nbsp;as frightening as before.</p>
 <p>When he opened his eyes, the fact that he was able to see Murong Qi Qi and hold her, let Feng Cang’s disturbed mind calm down. Just now, he was really afraid that Murong Qi Qi would leave him because of his ugly side. He didn’t expect that at the moment he had woken up, she was at his side.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, I’m sorry, I let you be worried!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang gently hugged Murong Qi Qi. His chin rubbed her hair.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry. Before I was so fierce towards you and scared you, I’m sorry!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>if you apologize to me, then it's as if you're regarding me as an outsider. Today, I was wrong. If I had known that <em>wangye </em>was feeling unwell, I wouldn’t have let <em>wangye</em> accompany me. <em>Wangye </em>also wouldn’t have suddenly gotten sick. I was wrong!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi combed Feng Cang’s hair with her hands, full of heartache. Her hand gently touched Feng Cang’s cold face.</p>
 <p>“However, next time, if <em>wangye </em>encounters uncomfortable things, <em>wangye </em>must tell me and let me know. Watching <em>wangye</em> being uncomfortable without being able to do anything made me feel very useless!”</p>
 <p>While talking, Murong Qi Qi’s tears fell. Thinking about the pain Feng Cang had suffered, Murong Qi Qi felt heartache. The cold poison and <em>gu </em>poison in his body were at least ten years. He had the fetal poison since birth. Really don’t know how he survived all these years! It must’ve been very hard, very very hard!</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, are you crying for me?”</p>
 <p>Looking at that drop of crystal-clear tear on Murong Qi Qi’s small chin, Feng Cang couldn’t help but take her once again in his embrace.</p>
 <p>Before, he didn’t tell Murong Qi Qi, because he was afraid that she’d worry and even more afraid that she’d leave him. Thinking about it now, he should abandon all of those thoughts. How would his woman have the same thoughts as ordinary women?!</p>
 <p>“Next time, I’ll surely not hide it from you. Really, I promise you!”</p>
 <p>On the snow ground, these pair of lovers told their inner feelings as though no one else was around. Ruyi was very sensible and retreated. Jin Mo looked deeply at Murong Qi Qi and then also retreated to one side.</p>
 <p>If saying that in the past, he thought that Murong Qi Qi had a hidden motive in approaching Feng Cang, now he was completely at ease. It so happened that master had said in the letter that this little junior sister was very skillful. He should discuss this with her and quickly find a cure for Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>However, Jin Mo didn’t know why Murong Qi Qi wanted to hide her identity from Feng Cang. She has martial arts and knows medicine which is good for Feng Cang. Why does she need to keep it a secret?</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Qi Qi had already become the best candidate to be Feng Cang’s wife in Jin Mo’s eyes. If Murong Qi Qi knew that Jin Mo hoped for a wife who understood medicine in order to take care of Feng Cang; knowing that all his thoughts were in consideration of Feng Cang, she would certainly take a good guess as to what kind of feelings Jin Mo had towards Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>To Ruyi, Jin Mo explained a bit about the misunderstanding between him and Murong Qi Qi in a simple way. In the end, he directed him to ‘seal’ his mouth and don’t tell Feng Cang about their dispute and that Murong Qi Qi had martial arts.</p>
 <p>“Mister, it’s a good thing that <em>wangfei </em>has martial arts, ah. Why shouldn’t we let <em>wangye </em>know?”</p>
 <p>Ruyi’s mind was simple and didn’t understand the hidden meaning inside. Letting him keep it from Feng Cang was impossible. Unless, there’s really a good reason.</p>
 <p>“Let <em>wangfei </em>be <em>wangye’s </em>hidden dagger…….”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo’s words were very simple. Ruyi understood immediately. So, it’s like that! <em>Wangfei </em>deliberately hid her martial arts in order to protect <em>wangye</em>, ah! Although they were <em>wangye’s </em>personal bodyguards, but there were times where they would be negligent. In that case, there would be&nbsp;<em>wangfei</em>. So, there’s no need to worry anymore!</p>
 <p>When Feng Cang and the others returned to the entourage, Su Mei and Su Yue immediately came forward to greet them.</p>
 <p>“Miss, is all alright with you?! Where did you go for so long, making us very worried?!”</p>
 <p>“I’m fine.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi hadn’t finished speaking yet, when Wanyan Bao Zhu rushed over,</p>
 <p>“Cang <em>gege</em>[3. Gege: big brother]<em>, </em>where did you go?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the worried expressions on Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die, who had followed behind her, Murong Qi Qi deliberately nestled into Feng Cang’s arms.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>in the future, you should take me to relax, yo! Being bored in the carriage every day really is too uncomfortable. It’s better to go outside and <em>have a world with only two people!”</em></p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Have a world with only two people: a romantic couple’s world. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>The moment Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die heard that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi went out on a ‘date’, their expression immediately changed.</p>
 <p>This Murong Qi Qi was wrapped around Feng Cang every day in the carriage and now she even went out with him, she really didn’t know what kind of thing ‘shame’ was.</p>
 <p>Immediately, Mu Yu Die opened her mouth to make things difficult for Murong Qi Qi: “Princess Zhao Yang, you and <em>wangye</em>&nbsp;are not married yet. There’s a saying that <em>men and women should not touch hands when they give or receive things.</em> Asking princess to have self-respect.”</p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>“Self-respect?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi acted&nbsp;like she heard the biggest joke. The eyes looking at Mu Yu Die were immediately full of sarcasm.</p>
 <p>“In any case, <em>wangye</em>&nbsp;and I have a marriage agreement. Men and women cultivating feelings before the marriage is a normal thing. Miss Mu indeed knows what self-respect is, but why is it that every time, you’ll rush to gather yourself to be at my family’s <em>wangye</em>’s side?!”</p>
 <p>“I, I didn’t!”</p>
 <p>Being talked like that by Murong Qi Qi, made Mu Yu Die’s face become red.</p>
 <p>She was not like Wanyan Bao Zhu who liked Feng Cang and made it known to everyone. She was a low-key and subtle person. She silently looked at Feng Cang, hoping that one day he’d turn around and notice her existence. So, her thoughts being pointed out by Murong Qi Qi, made Mu Yu Die ashamed into anger.</p>
 <p>“Zeze!”</p>
 <p>Looking at that beautiful face of Mu Yu Die which was now red like a monkey’s butt, Murong Qi Qi chuckled. Her head leaned against Feng Cang’s chest.</p>
 <p>Anyway, these women already hated her to death. They could never be friends. Why should she give them face when they are making things difficult for her?!</p>
 <p>“Doesn’t the rule say that a female player’s age can’t surpass eighteen? If I didn’t remember incorrectly, miss Mu’s age is already over twenty. If it’s found out that you have concealed your age to participate in the tournament, the people who know will say that miss is infatuated with our family’s <em>wangye </em>and deliberately hid your age to get close to <em>wangye. </em>The people who don’t know, really don’t know how they will see our family’s <em>wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi deliberately saying ‘our family’s<em> wangye’ </em>repeatedly, made Feng Cang really happy. Through observing these talks, Feng Cang found out that Murong Qi Qi’s possessiveness was quite strong. This point made Feng Cang very satisfied. Only when a woman cares about a man did they become so overbearing. She wants to be bossy, he is willing to let her be!</p>
 <p>“Now that beloved consort says<em>&nbsp;</em>it, <em>benwang</em>[4. Benwang: I used by prince of the first rank]<em>&nbsp;</em>remembers. Miss Mu indeed doesn’t meet the rules of the tournament. <em>Benwang </em>was indeed negligent in this matter. This time’s tournament is being held in Bei Zhou. If this matter is discovered&nbsp;by the other countries, it’ll certainly cause disputes. Servants, escort miss Mu back to the capital. <em>Benwang </em>will find another candidate to replace miss Mu.”</p>
 <p>Just one sentence from Murong Qi Qi was able to let Feng Cang make Mu Yu Die go away; it made people couldn’t help but have a whole new level of respect for her and they also became aware of her position in Feng Cang’s heart.</p>
 <p>“No, <em>wangye, </em>I won’t go! I sincerely want to participate in the tournament! I sincerely want to bring glory to the country!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die never imagined that Murong Qi Qi would be so ‘vicious’ and wouldn’t tolerate her (MYD)!</p>
 <p>This tournament between the four countries, which happened once every five years, was extremely rare. Because she was sick during the last tournament, she was unable to participate. This time, she’s over the age limit. It was only because she knelt, cried and begged for a long time in front of her grandfather, that in the end, prime minister Mu said some good words in front of the emperor. That’s why she was able to come.</p>
 <p>“<em>Benwang </em>believes miss Mu's sincerity, it’s just that the rules must be followed by all countries. Bei Zhou is no exception.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s answer was cold, unlike the gentleness he showed Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>not being able to participate in the tournament, alright! Please, asking you to allow me to watch the tournament! I want to experience what the tournament of the four countries is like. Don’t send me back!”</p>
 <p>If it was as usual, Wanyan Bao Zhu would have clapped at Mu Yu Die suffering defeat. However, today Wanyan Bao Zhu didn’t feel any happiness. After all, she and Mu Yu Die have a common enemy……Murong Qi Qi. If there’s no&nbsp;Mu Yu Die, wouldn’t her (WBZ) power be weaker? One more person is one more force, ah!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu went forward to plead for Mu Yu Die: “Cousin, since miss Mu's age surpassed the limit and she can’t participate in the tournament, let somebody take her position. However, we’ve been on the journey for so long. Now letting her, a woman, go back alone, it’s not safe and it’s not justifiable. Wouldn’t it better to let miss Mu go with us to Yongzhou?! Letting her only look at the tournament will also be good, ah!”</p>
 <p>While Wanyan Bao Zhu was speaking, she gave the other candidates a meaningful glance. The princess already opened her mouth, they also couldn’t refuse. So, they all went forward and pleaded for Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, what do you think?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang didn’t put those people in his eyes. He directly lowered his head to ask Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi saw and understood all those glances of Wanyan Bao Zhu. It seemed that she and Mu Yu Die were now standing on the same side. If she sent Mu Yu Die back, then wouldn’t Wanyan Bao Zhu’s power weaken? Then where would she (WBZ) have the ability to ‘bully’ her (MQQ). And when would she, Murong Qi Qi, have the chance to pull down the two of the, at once?!</p>
 <p>“Since princess opened your mouth to plead, this face, I should naturally give; otherwise, it’ll let people think that <em>wangye</em> is too inhumane. It’s better to let miss Mu stay! Speaking of which, she is also a pitiful person. Missing this opportunity, the next half of her life, she might not have this blessing anymore!”</p>
 <p>“Puchi……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words caused the laughter of one person. Wanyan Kang stepped on the snow and came towards them. His mouth was still wearing that black belly smile. He gave Murong Qi Qi a big thumbs up.</p>
 <p>“Cousin, you and cousin-in-law went away to have the world for you two alone, really let people wait for a long time. Next time, why don’t you bring us along?! If you don’t mind……”</p>
 <p>“<em>Benwang </em>minds!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi when he went inside the carriage, leaving a cold sentence: “<em>Benwang </em>hates <em>bum beetles</em> the most!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Bum beetle: someone who tags along</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>The moment Feng Cang’s words came out, Mu Yu Die almost cried. It’s certainly Murong Qi Qi who gossiped in front of Feng Cang. That’s why he shamed her like this in front of everyone. It must be that! If before, Mu Yu Die’s hatred towards Murong Qi Qi was only fifty percent, now it has upgraded to one hundred percent.</p>
 <p>Seeing Mu Yu Die’s expression, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t become happy. These past few days, Feng Cang was also cold towards her. No matter how she dressed, mature and beautiful or pure and pleasant, his eyes were always locked onto Murong Qi Qi. At his side, there was also always Murong Qi Qi. Now, it looked like Feng Cang was shaming Mu Yu Die, but was it not also a warning to her?!</p>
 <p>“Princess, endure temporarily, <em>the breeze will be still and the waves will be quiet</em>!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>The breeze will be still and the will be quiet: tranquil environment</em>.</li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Chou <em>er</em>[5. Er: term of endearment]<em>&nbsp;</em>quietly went to Wanyan Bao Zhu’s side.</p>
 <p>“When we reached Yongzhou city, we’ll make it so that she won’t be able to cry even if she wanted to.”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er’s </em>words reminded Wanyan Bao Zhu about the thing they had planned recently. Her mood turned a bit better.</p>
 <p>“Did you contact those people? Don’t make a mistake by then!”</p>
 <p>“Princess, rest assured. All have been arranged properly. We only need to wait till we arrive at Yongzhou.”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er</em> revealed an evil smile. Her eyes also fell on Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi’s carriage. Murong Qi Qi, you ruined me, I’ll also let you get a taste of what being ruined is like. I’ll let you be pleased for a few more days! When the time comes, I’ll let you feel that living is more painful than death!</p>
