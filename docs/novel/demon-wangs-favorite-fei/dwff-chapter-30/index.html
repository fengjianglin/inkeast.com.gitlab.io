 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter 30:&nbsp;Ce Wangfei</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er’s&nbsp;overbearing manner made Bai Mu Fei and Fang Kuifrown&nbsp;at the same time. Bai Mu Fei didn’t say&nbsp;anything, but Fang Kui couldn’t let someone&nbsp;speak like this about his master.</p>
 <p>“Even if princess&nbsp;can pay, it also depends on whether or not our&nbsp;family’s <em>gongzi </em>[1. Gongzi: young master] is in the mood. Not to mention…….”</p>
 <p>Fang Kui looked at Longze&nbsp;Yu Er from head to toe: “Looking at princess’&nbsp;worth, I fear that you cannot afford it.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say? Did you say that <em>bengong </em>[2. Bengong: this palace, I, used by the females of the imperial family] doesn’t have any money?”</p>
 <p>Being the high-above princess,&nbsp;when has Longze Yu Er ever been mocked like&nbsp;this?</p>
 <p>“What <em>bengong </em> has&nbsp;is plenty of money. Say, how much do you want?”</p>
 <p>“Hehe……”</p>
 <p>Seeing Longze Yu&nbsp;Er acting so ignorant, Fang Kui sneered.</p>
 <p>“Just the material of this set of ‘Begonia’s&nbsp;spring sleep’ in miss Bai’s hand is worth&nbsp;ten thousand golden teals, not including labor, product price and appreciation&nbsp;potential. Only this, princess is already&nbsp;unable to afford it. Moreover, even if princess&nbsp;is willing to sacrifice everything you have and is somehow able to get the money, our family’s <i><em>gongzi</em></i> may be unwilling to do&nbsp;it. After all, there are only very few people who can get in my family’s<i><em>gongzi’s </em></i>eyes. Princess can have less of these ideas, so as not&nbsp;to become a joke!”</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>Fang Kui not giving her face, made Longze Yu Er flip out on the spot: “Servants! Kill&nbsp;this bastard! Seal Tong Bao Zhai! Everywhere beneath the sky is the imperial&nbsp;family’s; around each corner, there are imperial officials.<i><em>Bengong </em></i>doesn’t believe that a small Tong Bao&nbsp;Zhai can defy <i><em>bengong’s</em></i>command!”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha ha!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Longze Yu&nbsp;Er’s words, Fang Kui laughed out loud:&nbsp;“Don’t need to trouble princess! From this&nbsp;day forward, there’s no longer a Tong Bao Zhai in Xi Qi country. My family’s <i><em>gongzi </em></i>has already moved Tong&nbsp;Bao Zhai to another country. The gift for miss Bai is&nbsp;our family’s <i><em>gongzi’s&nbsp;</em></i>last work in Xi&nbsp;Qi country.”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Fang&nbsp;Kui bowed respectfully to Bai Mu Fei and Bai Yi&nbsp;Yue: “Our family’s <i><em>gongzi</em></i>&nbsp;said&nbsp;to thank you two for your former care. Today, he has repaid miss Bai; in the future, he will surely send a big&nbsp;gift for young master Bai. The task <i><em>gongzi </em></i>gave this little one has been fulfilled.&nbsp;I won’t stay any longer and will take my leave!”</p>
 <p>After just a ‘take my leave’, Fang Kui and the attendant disappeared in front of&nbsp;everyone.</p>
 <p>Level eight martial artist! Bai Mu Fei was really shocked. Such a person is&nbsp;actually willing to be Guang Hua <i><em>gongzi’s </em></i>subordinate&nbsp;and be a small shopkeeper. Then what kind of stunning figure is that Guang Hua <i><em>gongzi</em></i>?!</p>
 <p>When the imperial guards of the capital&nbsp;arrived at Tong Bao Zhai, it was empty. Because princess&nbsp;Ping Yang wanted to close down Tong Bao Zhai, Tong Bao Zhai became the&nbsp;new topic. Miss Bai getting the set of&nbsp;‘Begonia’s spring sleep’, Jing <i><em>wang </em></i>[3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] breaking&nbsp;off the engagement andMurong Qi Qi marrying&nbsp;to a far away land became the hottest topics in the capital.</p>
 <p>At this point, the gloomiest person was none&nbsp;other than Jing <i><em>wang </em></i>Longze Jing Tian.&nbsp;With great difficulty, he was able to get rid of Murong&nbsp;Qi Qi. He didn’t expect that instead, he would be bound by Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>What Murong Tai said&nbsp;the moment he opened his mouth was about killing Murong&nbsp;Xin Lian. A woman’s body had been seen by another, no one would be&nbsp;willing to marry her. Such an immoral thing, it’s really a shame to the family.&nbsp;Holding a life in his hand, he forced Longze Jing Tian into agreeing to let Murong Xin Lian become a <em>cefei</em>[4. Cefei/ce wangfei: side concubine, second ranked wife of the prince of first rank].</p>
 <p>The second Longze&nbsp;Jing Tian nodded, Murong Tai immediately&nbsp;went into the palace to get the emperor’s approval. Soon afterwards, he let a&nbsp;small carriage directly send Murong Xin Lian&nbsp;to Jing <em>wangfu</em>[5. Wangfu: the residence of the prince of first rank].</p>
 <p>Now, Murong Xin&nbsp;Lian has already become Longze Jing Tian’s official&nbsp;<em>ce wangfei</em>. Without a reason, the w<i><em>angfu&nbsp;</em></i>got one more woman, which madeLongze Jing Tian&nbsp;feel extremely irritable.</p>
 <p>It just so happened that at that time, Du Xian Er had sent someone over with the jade&nbsp;pendant to get the five hundred thousand silver teals. After getting the money,&nbsp;the other party kept saying: “the greatest wish of our&nbsp;family’s miss in this lifetime is ‘willing to get one person’s heart till their hairs become white and still unwilling to be apart’. Since <i><em>wangye</em></i>already has a gentle&nbsp;and charming bride, don’t put on that kind of infatuated expression&nbsp;anymore. Deceiving another’s feelings is a small thing, but delaying our family’s miss’ marriage is big trouble!”</p>
 <p>Don’t know where Du&nbsp;Xian Er got such an eloquent girl. Every word was able to choke people&nbsp;to death but Longze Jing Tian was unable to&nbsp;do something to the other party. After all, she’s Du&nbsp;Xian Er’s confidante. He still wanted to marry Du&nbsp;Xian Er and make her his&nbsp;<i><em>wangfei</em></i>. He&nbsp;couldn’t offend the people around her.</p>
 <p>“<i><em>Wangye</em></i>,&nbsp;I lost her.”</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan stood&nbsp;with his hands behind his back in front of Longze&nbsp;Jing Tian. His head was lowered and he’s waiting to be reprimanded. He&nbsp;was originally following Su Mei and didn’t expect that the other party knew the&nbsp;capital very well. Just two blocks and she put him behind her.</p>
 <p>“Asking <i><em>wangye&nbsp;</em></i>for punishment!”</p>
 <p>“Her people, naturally……”</p>
 <p>Everything was within Longze&nbsp;Jing Tian’s expectations. Such a woman who was clear as ice and clean as&nbsp;jade, the people around her were naturally not bad. But she misunderstood him,</p>
 <p>didn’t want to see him, what can he do?</p>
 <p>After thinking for a long time, Longze Jing Tian commanded: “Du Xian Er is surely inside the capital. Lu Yuan, send people to investigate. You must find&nbsp;out Du Xian Er’s whereabouts. <em>Benwang </em>[6. Benwang: this king, I, used by the prince of first rank] doesn’t want her to misunderstand. <em>Benwang </em> must clearly explain it to her in&nbsp;person.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Regarding w<i><em>angye’s&nbsp;</em></i>infatuation, Lu Yuan could only&nbsp;sigh in secret. It’s just that she wants to hide with all her heart, so how&nbsp;will they be able to find her?!</p>
 <p>Outside the study, Lu&nbsp;Ye stopped Murong Xin Lian, who had come to visitLongze&nbsp;Jing Tian while carrying a tray of food.</p>
 <p>“<i><em>Ce wangfei, wangye</em></i> has&nbsp;something to do and doesn’t want to be bothered.”</p>
 <p>“Oh……”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian was&nbsp;somewhat disappointed. She lifted her eyes to look at the closed door. Her wish&nbsp;had finally come true. Although it’s only a&nbsp;<i><em>cefei</em></i>, Murong Xin Lian was confident that with her&nbsp;wisdom and beauty, she would surely be able to seize Longze&nbsp;Jing Tian’s heart. But yesterday night, Longze&nbsp;Jing Tian didn’t come to her place. In other words, Longze Jing Tian just gave her a place to live in&nbsp;the w<i><em>angfu</em></i> and didn’t have any other thoughts about her. This made Murong Xin Lian a bit worried.</p>
 <p>Seizing a man’s heart or giving birth to an offspring.&nbsp;This was the method Murong Xin Lian’s mother&nbsp;Zheng Min had once taught her! Not getting love? Then, must have a son to fall&nbsp;back on. Only then could a woman be considered to have something to look</p>
 <p>forward to.</p>
 <p>No, no, it can’t be like this! Cannot admit&nbsp;defeat easily like this!</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian took&nbsp;a deep breath. She just came into the w<i><em>angfu</em></i>. There would be ample time.&nbsp;She cannot be impatient. Impatience will botch things. After all, she has&nbsp;plenty of time! Longze Jing Tian’s heart, she&nbsp;wants! Son, she wants! The seat of <i><em>wangfei,&nbsp;</em></i>she also wants! What women deserve or not deserve, she wants them all!</p>
 <p>“This is the green bean lily soup I&nbsp;personally stewed. Troubling you to send it to <i><em>wangye.&nbsp;</em></i>I will go back now!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian let&nbsp;the maid next to her put down the food container. From beginning to end, her&nbsp;face showed a soft smile. There isn’t any trace of anger.</p>
 <p>“I will go back! Sorry to trouble you!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s attitude&nbsp;towards this new <i><em>ce wangfei</em></i>, Lu Yuan&nbsp;and Lu Ye, who followed him, knew very well. Originally, Lu Ye thought that after&nbsp;Murong Xin Lian heard that Longze Jing Tian didn’t want to see her, she would&nbsp;get angry and put up airs. He didn’t expect that the other party was so&nbsp;pleasant. This made Lu Ye have some good feelings towards this <i><em>ce wangfei.</em></i> He picked up the food container&nbsp;and walked in.</p>
 <p>“<i><em>Benwang </em></i>doesn’t&nbsp;like sweets, you guys eat!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian&nbsp;frowned and pushed the food container away.</p>
 <p>“In the future, if she sends more, you&nbsp;eat them all. <i><em>Benwang </em></i>doesn’t want to&nbsp;see it.”</p>
 <p>For ten consecutive days, regardless of the&nbsp;weather, every afternoon Murong Xin Lian&nbsp;would personally send a pot of soup for Longze Jing&nbsp;Tian. The result was that all of it went to the two brothers from Lu&nbsp;family and she didn’t know.</p>
 <p>And during these ten days, from Bei Zhou came&nbsp;the news that Nan Lin <i><em>wang </em></i>Feng Cang&nbsp;would personally come to Xi Qi to escort <i><em>wangfei&nbsp;</em></i>to Bei Zhou. And he sent an aunt who&nbsp;knew etiquette very well to teach Bei Zhou’s court etiquette to Murong Qi Qi. He also&nbsp;sent a multi-talented master to travel with the aunt, mainly to teach the&nbsp;future Nan Lin <i><em>wangfei </em></i>Bei Zhou’s&nbsp;language and customs.</p>
