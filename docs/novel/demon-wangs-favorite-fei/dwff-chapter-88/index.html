 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 88 The shy Nan Lin Wang (2)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ay…….</p>
 <p>Don’t know why, suddenly Murong Qi Qi felt pity.</p>
 <p>This world was very demanding towards women. Women were weak and needed to rely on a man to survive. That’s why they needed to be humble and do everything with the man in the center. They would be played by men. A woman like Guli, being so bold in public, a woman playing with ‘men’, there were very few of them. Such a woman died, this world lost a wonderful little flower……</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi squatted and closed Guli’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye[1. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank], </em>let’s find a place where you could see the mountains and rivers to bury Guli!”</p>
 <p>Just now, they were hostile towards each other. Now, as a woman, Murong Qi Qi’s soft spot had been awakened by Guli’s last tears.</p>
 <p>Which woman was not a pure flower at first, when&nbsp;going into a man's arms with a heart full of love? But, only after experiencing betrayal would&nbsp;the evil in the heart of a woman breed and make them do deviant things. Guli was nothing but a pitiful person.</p>
 <p>“Good!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang helped Murong Qi Qi up and told the servants to bury Guli. When Helan Lian Yi saw that Guli had died, he only frowned and then left hurriedly with Long Duo.</p>
 <p>“Interesting, interesting!”</p>
 <p>Upstairs in Cyclamen, Jia Lan sipped wine. Just now, he was upstairs and saw everything clearly. At this point, he somewhat understood why Feng Can took a fancy&nbsp;to Murong Qi Qi. This woman indeed had a talent to shock people and also had something that attracted the eyes of people. The dance of just now almost let him lose his soul and be in a&nbsp;daze…….</p>
 <p>“Sir Jia Lan, the knockout competition is ready.”</p>
 <p>One person came forward with a respectful attitude.</p>
 <p>“Everything is ready, only waiting for the tournament to begin.”</p>
 <p>“Good!”</p>
 <p>Jia Lan drank the last bottle of wine. He stood up and looked deeply once more at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Take me to the venue. I want to check it personally.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>The man in blue retreated&nbsp;to one&nbsp;side and then followed behind Jia Lan.</p>
 <p>“Sir, this time, our knockout competition will certainly make them shocked. This subordinate feels that if three people can pass, then it’s already not bad.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t look down on those people……”</p>
 <p>Jia Lan wasn’t as optimistic as the man in blue.</p>
 <p>“However strong you are, there is always someone stronger.”</p>
 <p>“But, sir Misha’s seven level pagoda, even the disciples from the island, there weren’t many who could pass it. Moreover, these contestants simply can not be compared to our Penglai island’s people.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, be careful, caution is the parent of safety. Who can guarantee that among these contestants, there’s no black horse…...”</p>
 <p>While saying that, suddenly in Jia Lan’s mind appeared the image of Murong Qi Qi dancing. Don’t know if that woman would participate in the tournament of the four countries or not. If she participates, then the outcome&nbsp;will really be something to look forward to!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>The duel ended with Guli’s death and Helan Lian Yi losing a hundred thousand golden teals.</p>
 <p>Just when Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi were about to leave, suddenly Longze Jing Tian appeared in front of Murong Qi Qi. He stared deeply at her. In his eyes was a strong love.</p>
 <p>“Xian Er, is it you? I’ve searched a long time for you!”</p>
 <p>It turned out that Murong Qi Qi’s dance made Longze Jing Tian think about the day Du Xian Er saved him in the forest. Just now, when Murong Qi Qi was dancing, in his mind repeatedly appeared Du Xian Er, who had landed from the sky in front of him, fully clothed in white. When the two figures overlapped, they had actually matched so well.</p>
 <p>“Jing <em>wang</em>, please conduct yourself with dignity.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi took one step back and went into Feng Cang’s arms.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about! If this is Jing <em>wang’s </em>way to strike, I can only tell Jing <em>wang</em> that this way is a failure!”</p>
 <p>Even&nbsp;when Feng Cang, who was&nbsp;holding Murong Qi Qi’s hand, moved far away, Longze Jing Tian still looked infatuatedly at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Xian Er, is it you? In the end, is it really&nbsp;you?”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s words went into Murong Qing Lian’s ears, making her dislike this rubbish third big sister even more. Today, Murong Qi Qi let people be surprised. It’s just, why was it that everywhere this woman went, she was able to seduce men? Feng Cang’s eyes almost dropped honey and now Longze Jing Tian was also like that. Where was there anything good about this woman?! Murong Qing Lian bit her lips and mercilessly stamped on the ground.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>When Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi arrived at Meixiang <em>yuan[2. Yuan:&nbsp;wing of a residence], </em>Helan Lian Yi already let people send over a hundred thousand golden teals.</p>
 <p>“Did you count it? Inspect it?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi drank a mouthful of tea and asked Su Yue.</p>
 <p>“Answering miss, everything was real and the amount is also right!”</p>
 <p>Su Yue laughed while answering. Her mood was very good. Before, Fang Jing was worried that building the world’s best place for business would need a lot of capital. Now, miss only went away for&nbsp;a bit and came back with a&nbsp;hundred thousand golden teals. If Fang Jing saw it, he’ll certainly be happy enough&nbsp;to die.</p>
 <p>“Mm, be careful. Put it away&nbsp;in a safe place.”</p>
 <p>When she finished talking, she turned and looked smilingly at Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>you have wealth equivalent to that of an entire nation. I’m afraid that these hundred thousand golden teals certainly&nbsp;won't enter your eyes. Take it as if I won some pocket money, alright?”</p>
 <p>Ruyi, who was&nbsp;listening to this, almost spouted out blood. <em>Wangfei[3.Wangfei:&nbsp;main wife/consort of&nbsp;first-rank prince]&nbsp;</em>really has an appetite of a lion, ah! Where in this world was there a woman who&nbsp;would&nbsp;take a hundred thousand golden teals as pocket money? Even the princesses in the palace didn’t have&nbsp;this much pocket money, ah!</p>
 <p>“Originally, this money was given to you by Helan Lian Yi to lessen your shock. Naturally, it’s your money.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang smiled, and Ruyi almost bit off his tongue. Master pampers <em>wangfei </em>too much! But having said that, this money was indeed earned by <em>wangfei</em> herself.</p>
 <p>“Then, thanking <em>wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi quickly stood up and bowed towards Feng Cang. She didn’t even&nbsp;bow yet, when she was pulled into Feng Cang’s arms.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, don’t you need to confess something? Hmm…...”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang stretched out his voice. Su Yue and the others saw that, and they knew that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi had something to talk about, so&nbsp;they retreated. When they left, they specially closed the door.</p>
 <p>“What is <em>wangye </em>talking about? Confess what?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi blinked her eyes innocently as if she didn’t understand what Feng Cang meant.</p>
 <p>“You, ah……”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like that, Feng Cang didn’t want to force her. As long as she’s safe and happy, it’s enough!</p>
 <p>Feng Cang pinched Murong Qi Qi’s nose. His eyes were full of pampering and love.</p>
 <p>“You having a little secret, I don’t mind that. I’m willing to wait for the day you completely open your heart. Just, next time when you encounter such a thing again, tell me&nbsp;in advance, lest to let me worry so much at&nbsp;one side!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang didn’t continue to pursue the matter, but let her keep some private space, making Murong Qi Qi very moved. She took the initiative to go into Feng Cang’s arms.</p>
 <p>“Feng Cang, you really are&nbsp;good to me!”</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing is also not bad towards me, ah! Today, who repeatedly said ‘Feng Cang is my man’ in front of everyone?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s face turned red when Feng Cang mentioned this. Originally, she said those words to anger Guli and also at the same time, beat back those ill-intentioned women like Murong Qing Lian, who wanted to covet Feng Cang. She didn’t think much about it. Unexpectedly, Feng Cang let those words&nbsp;enter his mind. Really embarrassing, ah.</p>
 <p>“Before, you said them so righteously, how come you’re shy now? My reputation has been ruined by you. Qing Qing, you say, shouldn’t you compensate me?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s devilishly beautiful face moved closer to Murong Qi Qi. That pair of quiet eyes was full of spring, making Murong Qi Qi couldn’t help but put her hands on Feng Cang’s face.</p>
 <p>“Feng Cang, you look really charming……”</p>
 <p>“Oh…...”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi saying such a praise, made Feng Cang give her a knowing smile. He put her jade-like hand against his lips and kissed it gently.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, if I was a woman and you praised me like that, I will feel happy. But, I’m a man. Being praised like a woman, I’m very sad. Could it be that Qing Qing is saying I’m very sissy?”</p>
 <p>“No, no, no!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi immediately gestured with her hand and quickly denied.</p>
 <p>“I just never have seen such a man like you. You’re really a devilish beauty!”</p>
 <p>The moment he heard ‘devilish beauty’, Feng Cang raised his head and casted a flirtatious glance at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Since Qing Qing praise me as&nbsp;a devilish beauty; if I don’t do something to tempt you, then wouldn’t I not be living&nbsp;up to Qing Qing’s praise?”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to understand, Feng Cang’s handsome face moved over. Red lips leaned closer, seizing Murong Qi Qi’s petal-like soft lips and gently sucked on them.</p>
 <p>Sweet with a taste of green apples making a person float. Moreover, Murong Qi Qi’s lips were extremely soft. It was like kissing soft clouds. Feng Cang gently bit on her soft lips. He didn’t dare to use force in fear of hurting her</p>
 <p>“Uh…...”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s face turned red because of shyness. She closed her eyes and moaned once. She didn’t think that the heat on her lips would stop. She opened her eyes. Feng Cang’s handsome face was red, but his eyes were full of worries.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter? Qing Qing, did I hurt you with the&nbsp;biting?”</p>
 <p>So, it turned out, that the moan of Murong Qi Qi, in Feng Cang’s ears, it sounded like he had hurt her. That’s why he stopped.</p>
 <p>Looking at Feng Cang’s uneasy expression and his red face, Murong Qi Qi’s heart jumped badly. This man is too cute! What kind of hearing is that, ah? To actually turn comfortable into pain. Is it that he has never kissed before?</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi once again looked at Feng Cang. Feng Cang’s face turned redder. He didn’t dare look at Murong Qi Qi. Their gaze just met for a moment, and then he quickly turned to look somewhere at the roof. Now, Murong Qi Qi was more certain about her thought.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>could it be that you’ve never kissed a girl before?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi asked carefully. Her eyes were locked on Feng Cang’s face.</p>
 <p>Now, Feng Cang’s face burned completely. So hot, it was painful.</p>
 <p>What should he do? Could it be that just now, he had hurt her while biting? So embarrassed, he wanted to die. Why did such a thing happen? The first time he kissed and he left such a bad impression on Murong Qi Qi. Will she laugh at him?</p>
 <p>“Haha!”</p>
 <p>It’s the first time that&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi saw such a shy Feng Cang. She didn’t think that he would&nbsp;be this&nbsp;shy. Blood could now be pinched out of that handsome face. He looked so brightly red, very devilishly beautiful. It’s just that this man was shy because of a kiss, really too cute! Just now, he just sucked her lips like a baby. Could it be that he thinks that this is kissing?!</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing is laughing at me……”</p>
 <p>Being laughed&nbsp;at by Muong Qi Qi, Feng Cang’s male self-esteem was completely blown away. He had&nbsp;coveted for a long time, before he got the courage today to <em>eat </em>Murong Qi Qi’s <em>tofu</em>. But the result was like this. Such a shame, ah!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Eat tofu: take advantage in a sexual manner</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Feng Cang like that, Murong Qi Qi quickly moved to him and nestled inside Feng Cang’s arms.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>, I’m very happy!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi pointed at her heart.</p>
 <p>“Here is truly very happy!”</p>
 <p>“I like men who are clean like <em>wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>So, it’s like that……Don’t know why, after hearing those words, Feng Cang felt relieved. It’s as if a big mountain had been pressing on his shoulder and was now completely put down. So, it was like that…….</p>
 <p>“This is <em>wangye’s </em>first kiss, I’m very happy!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi raised her head while laughing. Such a bright face made Feng Cang lose his soul.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>just now you didn’t hurt me……it’s just kissing is not like that……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s hands hooked Feng Cang’s neck to let him lower his head. She took the initiative to give him her lips.</p>
 <p>Four soft sides touched each other. Murong Qi Qi’s naughty tongue slowly entered Feng Cang’s mouth. Feng Cang looked at Murong Qi Qi’s face&nbsp;with his eyes&nbsp;wide open. He looked straight at Murong Qi Qi. His face was full of disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Fool, close your eyes!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi blushed. Feng Cang quickly closed his eyes. He did as Murong Qi Qi and stuck out his tongue.</p>
 <p>So, kissing is like this, ah! Feng Cang finally understood that the dabble and stop of just now was not considered kissing. Such a lingering was a real kiss. So, it’s like this!</p>
 <p>Although Murong Qi Qi initiated it, but she’s also inexperienced. Feng Cang secretly opened his eyes and looked at Murong Qi Qi. She was drunkenly into the kiss with her eyes closed. That face, as small as a palm, was pinkish because of shyness. Looking at that face, it was even more moving.</p>
 <p>It’s also the first time for his Qing Qing! Feng Cang’s heart beat happily! She’s so sweet with a fragrance of green apples, making him unwilling to let this love go.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Feng Cang pushed Murong Qi Qi away. He panted.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, can’t anymore! I’m afraid that if we continue like this, I will be unable to hold myself in and will want to eat you today!</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s eyes were full of daze and temptation, stimulating all of Feng Cang’s senses.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang once again pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace. Red lips fell, not on her lips but on her smooth forehead.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, I love you! However, no matter how much I love you, how much I want to have you completely, I must wait till the wedding night! I want to give you an unparalleled wedding. I want to let you become my most beautiful bride! I don’t want to destroy the sacredness of a marriage! Qing Qing, I love you!”</p>
 <p>This man, ah……leaning against Feng Cang’s chest, listening to his rapid heartbeat, Murong Qi Qi’s heart felt sweet as honey.</p>
 <p>Being so close to him, she could sense his restlessness. However, he was still trying to suppress himself. His speech also expressed the voice in his heart. Obviously, he wanted to get it so much, but he still bore with it. She really didn’t know what to say anymore. She could only nestle quietly in his arms and enjoyed this beautiful sweetness……</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Because of the kiss, Feng Cang’s and Murong Qi Qi’s feelings once again reached another level. And at Wanyan Bao Zhu’s, she was creating a plan.</p>
 <p>“Princess, I brought the drug.”</p>
 <p>Yong <em>er[4. Er: term of&nbsp;endearment]</em>&nbsp;marched into the room, bringing the taste of the night with her. She handed Wanyan Bao Zhu a packet of drug.</p>
 <p>“The doctor said, as long as you put a little in the food; within an hour, it’ll cause diarrhea. Even the wisest doctor wouldn’t be able to cure it in an instant. Having diarrhea for a couple of days, even the healthiest people will not be able to walk!”</p>
 <p>“Good! Very good!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu took out a hairpin and handed it over to Yong <em>er</em>.</p>
 <p>“This is a reward for you. Take good care of it! Tomorrow morning, slip into the small kitchen and put the drug in the dishes!”</p>
 <p>“Thanks princess! This slave will definitely complete the task!”</p>
 <p>After getting the hairpin, Yong <em>er</em> retreated cheerfully. Don’t know what happened to Wanyan Bao Zhu recently. She didn’t follow Feng Cang with an infatuated look anymore. She stayed at home every day, but she’s a lot more generous than in the past. She&nbsp;had gifted Yong <em>er</em> several accessories by now, making Yong <em>er</em> surprised and a lot more happier. She felt that because Ning <em>er</em> had died and Chou <em>er</em> left, princess was now even more attentive towards her. That’s why she had been so generous.</p>
 <p>Yong <em>er</em> was grateful to Wanyan Bao Zhu from the bottom of her heart. So, she put more effort&nbsp;into doing&nbsp;the errands for Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>Seeing the happy expression on Yong <em>er</em> when she retreated, Wanyan Bao Zhu humphed coldly. Really shortsighted. With only a few jewelries, she had been bribed the moment she&nbsp;told what she had heard this morning; Murong Qi Qi had actually defeated Nan Feng’s contestant. Wanyan Bao Zhu’s heart wrung together.</p>
 <p>Why was this woman so lucky? When did she learn martial arts? Why had she never heard about it? Or was it that Murong Qi Qi was a&nbsp;very deep schemer and had been hiding it? Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t help but think about those corpses from Wu Ji Gong outside the city. Could it be that all those people&nbsp;had been&nbsp;killed by Murong Qi Qi? If it’s really like that, then Murong Qi Qi&nbsp;was truly very frightening!</p>
 <p>A question had been entangled in Wanyan Bao Zhu’s heart all this time. It was about&nbsp;the cause of Zhao Lang's death and also the cause of the deaths of those people from Wu Ji Gong and the real princess. Now, Murong Qi Qi knew martial arts. Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t help but put these two things together. Could these have&nbsp;been done by Murong Qi Qi?</p>
 <p>It’s just, no matter how Wanyan Bao Zhu thought about this question, she couldn’t find the answer. As for Mu Yu Die, since she had returned, she was a bit out of her mind. She had been having that dazed and foolish expression. Although Jin Mo prescribed medicine for her, but wanting to get something out of her in a short period of time, was impossible. Now, the only thing she (WBZ) could do was to let every contestant unable to participate in the tournament. By then, she’d see how Murong Qi Qi&nbsp;could continue to be Nan Lin <em>wangfei</em>!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>The next morning, noon hadn't even been reached, when from the other <em>yuans</em> came the news that every contestant ate the wrong thing, got a bad stomachache and&nbsp;had diarrhea. When Feng Cang and Jin Mo arrived, aside from Wanyan Kang who had slept in and didn’t eat breakfast, the others were pale-faced.</p>
 <p>“What happened?!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang coldly swept around once. When his gaze met Wanyan Bao Zhu’s, Wanyan Bao Zhu got a guilty conscience and slightly lowered her head.</p>
 <p>“Cousin brother, someone put this in the dishes!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang handed a paper found at the corner of the kitchen to Feng Cang. Jin Mo took it and sniffed.</p>
 <p>“It’s Croton powder.”</p>
 <p>“Croton powder?”</p>
 <p>Using Croton powder wouldn’t harm people’s life, but&nbsp;would make&nbsp;people need to go to the bathroom till their legs turned weak. They wouldn’t be able to participate in the tournament.</p>
 <p>“Who did it?”</p>
 <p>“It’s her!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang let people bring out a person who was tied. The moment they looked, they saw it was Wanyan Bao Zhu’s maid Yong <em>er</em>.</p>
 <p>“I investigated everyone. She went into the kitchen this morning and&nbsp;acted very sneaky. It’s definitely her!”</p>
 <p>“Say, who let you do it?!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s voice was calm, but the indifference and coldness inside it, let Yong <em>er</em> shiver.</p>
 <p>“Say!”</p>
