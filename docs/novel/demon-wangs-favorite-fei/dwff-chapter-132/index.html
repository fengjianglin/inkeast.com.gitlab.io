 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 132 So it’s you (2)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>‘Shh…’ Murong Qi Qi retrieved the golden threads and looked at the man whose whole body was covered in a white light.&nbsp; Humph, no wonder this person was so proud. He had such an ability! His inner energy was already at the white level eight. This person couldn’t be overlooked. It seemed that it had been a very long time since there was someone with the white level eight inner energy who'd appeared in this mainland. Who was this person?</p>
 <p>This time, it was Murong Qi Qi’s turn to stand there without moving. Before, she made the moves just to test the bottom line of the man in white with the silver mask. Now that she'd discovered the ability of the other party, Murong Qi Qi didn’t move again. She only stood quietly neither far nor near, just ten meters opposite Feng Cang in the night.</p>
 <p>A duel between experts; the one who makes the first move, would be the one who loses. Feng Cang understood this. Murong Qi Qi also understood this.</p>
 <p>At this time, two powerful airs surrounded the two people and formed a shallow whirlpool. Those people in black who had been originally thrown to the ground by Murong Qi Qi stood up and left the scene. They clearly knew that if at this time, they appeared around these two people, they would become ashes.</p>
 <p>Through the white porcelain mask, Murong Qi Qi looked coldly at the man with the silver mask. She wanted to solve the confusion in her heart. “I want to ask you one thing. Why did you touch my people and burned down my Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang?!&nbsp; I have neither animosity nor hatred with you. Since it’s like this, there must be a reason. I want to know that reason.”</p>
 <p>The moment he heard Murong Qi Qi say Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai had been burned, Nalan Xin was startled. He didn’t let people do such a thing. He only let people kidnap the people and didn’t let them do those overboard things. Even though he'd captured Fang Tong, he didn’t torture him for information. He used a civilized and peaceful way. What was Murong Qi Qi talking about?</p>
 <p>“You shouldn’t have been tempted by my woman!” Hearing Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>[1. Gongzi: young master] ask, Feng Cang also no longer hid it and said the reason.</p>
 <p>The cold faint words of the other party almost let Murong Qi Qi spurt out blood. Her orientation as a woman had always been very normal. She loves men. She loves Feng Cang. When did the person she loved turn into a woman?</p>
 <p>“There must be some misunderstanding here.”</p>
 <p>“There’s no misunderstanding! My woman has been silently concerned about you. Everyone knows about you and her matter. You still say there isn’t?”</p>
 <p>Everyone from the <em>jianghu</em>[2. Jianghu: world of martial arts] said that Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>and Du Xian Er were a pair of immortals. Everyone knew about this, yet Guanghua<em> gongzi </em>had actually denied it. He really didn’t shoulder the responsibility! Feng Cang looked down upon the man in red even more. He (FC) thought he (GH) was a coward.</p>
 <p>If Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>had admitted that he loved Murong Qi Qi, that he liked Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang would’ve admired him and would think he had good taste. He didn’t expect that the other party would deny it directly. Wasn’t this failing the affection Murong Qi Qi had for him?!</p>
 <p>“Uh…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi felt completely wronged.</p>
 <p>It was undeniable that whenever she appeared as Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>, she was indeed very popular among women and got the favor of women. However, she was a normal woman and didn’t have a special liking and also didn’t have an alternative orientation. She never had a close contact with any woman. The man in white with a silver mask’s words were extremely absurd and ridiculous in Murong Qi Qi’s ears.</p>
 <p>“I say, did you make a mistake? I admit I am <em>tall, rich and handsome</em>, have money and am charming, but I am not a casual person. If it’s your woman’s wishful thinking, then you couldn’t treat me as a firecracker because of her unrequited love!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Tall, rich and handsome: Mr. Perfect. In China, the perfect husband material should be tall, rich and handsome. The importance is also in that order. A husband needs to be tall first. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p><em>Tall, rich and handsome</em>…After this was said, Nalan Xin couldn’t help but cough twice. Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>was indeed very rich. As for the appearance, rumor had it that he was godlike. So, that shouldn’t be bad. As for the height, according to Guanghua <em>gongzi’s </em>small body, this word seemed inappropriate.</p>
 <p>Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>using ‘wishful thinking’ to describe Murong Qi Qi made Feng Cang explode completely. His woman, the treasure he cares about, the flesh of his heart, in the other party’s eyes, turned out to be so disdainful!</p>
 <p>Thinking about how anxious Murong Qi Qi was after knowing something had happened to Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang, Feng Cang felt that he (GH) was not worthy of Murong Qi Qi. She was so concerned for Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>, but the other party used ‘unrequited love’ to send her away. Really enough is enough!</p>
 <p>“Humph!” The figure in white flew like a sword towards Murong Qi Qi. The killing intent in the black eyes behind the silver mask was very strong.</p>
 <p>Just now, Feng Cang had regretted ruining Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai, making Murong Qi Qi sad; but now, after seeing this ‘bastard’ in red, all the guilt had disappeared. This man deserved a good spanking. He (GH) actually insulted his (FC) treasure. He deserves to be killed!</p>
 <p>“Haha…” Murong Qi Qi returned two sneers to the other party. If you want to condemn someone, then don’t worry about the pretext! Casually find a shabby reason to ruin her efforts and kidnap her people. Could it be that he thinks she’s a dope and could be bullied by anybody?!</p>
 <p>‘Ding ling ling…’ Feng Cang was in the sky; Murong Qi Qi stood on the ground. One in red, one in white. It was truly beautiful. The dagger in Feng Cang’s hand stabbed mercilessly towards Murong Qi Qi’s neck. But it hadn’t reached her yet, when it was wrapped by the golden silk. With a sound of the bell, a purple smoke sprayed on Feng Cang’s face.</p>
 <p>Despicable! Feng Cang turned to escape the purple smoke. Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>had actually used poison! As the purple smoke fell on the ground, the stones melted instantly. Feng Cang hated the man in red in front of him even more. Guanghua <em>gongzi’s </em>poison was definitely given to him by Murong Qi Qi. While he enjoyed Murong Qi Qi’s benefits, he trampled Murong Qi Qi’s feelings. This man is despicable!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was also very surprised. That attack with the dagger of just now was with full power. If it wasn’t because she had long prepared against it, even if going head-on, she would’ve gotten injured. This man had the intention to kill? Because of an excuse which she was unable to make heads or tails of it? Really too shameless, really a bastard!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi was also too lazy to say any more nonsense. The golden threads swayed; the golden bells rang and attacked Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>For a time, the people watching were dazzled by the scene in front of them. The left and right hands of the man in red were extremely flexible. Five fingers hooked on the thread as though the fingers had given life to the threads; directing the golden threads to attack their master Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>Now, Nalan Xin also put the matter of burning Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai to the back of his head. He didn’t have time to think about who the black-handed master behind it was. His gaze focused on Feng Cang and Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>and watched them fight.</p>
 <p>It had been a long time since he had seen his master fight. Today, this Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>and his master were quite evenly matched. Nalan Xin was somewhat exited. The loneliness of a high-skilled person was a sad thing for Feng Cang. At least, Nalan Xin thought that.</p>
 <p>Although master’s body was weak, but this didn’t mean that he was weak. Otherwise, how could he take charge of the eagle troop at the age of fifteen, swept through the northern nomadic people and let Bei Zhou’s army become the most powerful army in this mainland?</p>
 <p>However, Nalan Xin looked for half a day and discovered that this Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>was also a rare young talent in this world. When he (NX) let himself go all the way, he could take twenty attacks of Feng Cang. However, this Guanghua <em>gongzi</em> actually fought more than a hundred rounds with <em>wangye</em>[3. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank] using only two soft silk threads. If it wasn’t because he was not someone ordinary, how could he do it?!</p>
 <p>Speaking of this, the woman was to blame. Two outstanding men fought for an outstanding woman. Naturally, there would be contradiction between them. It was just; he didn’t know who would win. He’d rather Feng Cang wins, but looking at the situation now, it’s possible that they would have a draw.</p>
 <p>In the air, the red and white figure intertwined. While exchanging blows with Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>, Feng Cang suddenly smelled a familiar green apple fragrance. It was just, why would this fragrance appear on Guanghua <em>gongzi’s </em>body? Could it be that their relationship already went so well?</p>
 <p>Thinking about the little woman that he kissed may have been embraced by this despicable man in front of him, the strength in his hand intensified ten times.</p>
 <p>Shameless bastard! Obviously, it was he who was unreasonable and yet, he was still so aggressive!</p>
 <p>Sensing Feng Cang’s outbreak, Murong Qi Qi was also not polite. A black dagger appeared in her hand and cut off Feng Cang’s sleeve. The dagger went close to Feng Cang’s skin and stabbed towards his wrist.</p>
 <p>“Humph! A big man who is like a woman.” Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>was fast, Feng Cang was faster. He grabbed Guanghua <em>gongzi’s </em>wrist. After touching the other party, Feng Cang discovered that the other party’s wrists were slim like a woman’s.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!” Being touched by another man, Murong Qi Qi was furious. She’s Feng Cang’s. How could she allow someone aside from Feng Cang to touch her. This man was really a bastard!</p>
 <p>Because of flying into a rage out of humiliation, Murong Qi Qi also forgot her strokes. Instinctively, she kicked the underbody of the silver masked man. The other party didn’t let go. His other free hand caught Murong Qi Qi’s ankle.</p>
 <p>With a grasp, Feng Cang was puzzled. Where was there a man with such a small skeleton? Even the ankle was so slim like a woman’s…</p>
 <p>A girl? Feng Cang suddenly looked up from surprise. Looking at the beautiful white cat mask in front of him, he didn’t expect that Murong Qi Qi’s other hand would slap him straight on his silver mask, “Stinky rogue!”</p>
 <p>A ‘pa…’ sound made everyone’s mind went blank and also woke Feng Cang up. This voice and also this tone; plus this small hand, if this wasn’t Murong Qi Qi, then who else could it be?!</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing?” Feng Cang didn’t know what kind of words he should use to describe his feelings now. Shocked? Foolishly frightened? Surprised? Overflown with happiness… (Alright, in fact, it’s rabbit who couldn’t describe it).</p>
 <p>“Qing your sister!”</p>
 <p>The other party not only controlled her hand and foot. He also used the way Feng Cang called her to call her. This let Murong Qi Qi become angrier. Her leg flew to the man in white’s chest. The other party fell on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! I’m going to kill you!” Looking at the foolish smile on the silver masked man’s face, the golden thread in Murong Qi Qi’s hand danced and flew towards Feng Cang’s throat.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>!” Nalan Xin looked at the foolish Feng Cang and screamed.</p>
 <p>“Miss! Have mercy!”</p>
 <p>On the other side, Su Mei, Su Yue and Fang Tong had also arrived. Su Yue was anxious. The dart in her hand directly interrupted the direction of the golden thread.</p>
 <p>‘Boom!’ Only after Feng Cang heard the loud noise, did he wake up. He jumped up like a carp, “Qing Qing, you want to murder your husband, ah?!”</p>
 <p>“Qing your…” Murong Qi Qi didn’t finish and looked startled at the man opposite her for a moment. It turned out that, the slap from just now moved Feng Cang’s silver mask a bit and revealed his pair of devilishly beautifully smiling eyes, “Cang?”</p>
 <p>“It’s me!”</p>
 <p>Now, Feng Cang didn’t know what to say. Su Mei and Su Yue rushed to Murong Qi Qi’s side. One on the left and the other on the right, both checked her body. “Miss, are you alright?! Miss!”</p>
 <p>“Uh, I’m fine…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi also became foolish now. What kind of situation was this? How did the other party become Feng Cang?</p>
 <p>“It’s me, Qing Qing!” Feng Cang took down the mask and revealed his face. It was just, on Feng Cang devilishly beautifully face was now a look of disbelief and surprise. He reached out. Murong Qi Qi didn’t reject and let Feng Cang take down that white porcelain cat mask, revealing the face he was familiar with.</p>
 <p>“How could it be you?!” Murong Qi Qi couldn’t close her small mouth. She could only look blankly at Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“You’re Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>?” Although Feng Cang wanted to suppress his excitement, but his trembling voice still betrayed his heart. What exactly was going on? Murong Qi Qi was actually Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>? How could this be? Was Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>not a man…?</p>
 <p>However, with a closer look, Feng Cang discovered the correlation. Since Murong Qi Qi could be Lian <em>gongzi</em>, why couldn’t she be Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>? She liked to cross-dress and disguise as a man. For her, it was more convenient to move in the <em>jianghu</em> and also facilitate her work!</p>
 <p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang suddenly giggled. What was he doing? What kind of vinegar was he eating? Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>and Murong Qi Qi were the same person. He actually almost let the vinegar flood the whole capital for the same person? And also let Nalan Xin do such a ridiculous thing…</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Feng Cang suddenly remembered Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai which had been burned by Nalan Xin…This time, he’s (FC) in big trouble. He destroyed Murong Qi Qi’s effort. How should he compensate this?</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was in a daze for a long time. Only when she saw Fang Tong, did Murong Qi Qi recover. “Uncle Fang, are you alright?! And the other brothers?! How are they? What happened? Who burned Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi came alone to Lion Ridge to save him, Fang Tong was very excited. Only just now, when his servant and Su Yue came looking for him, did he find out what had happened at Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai. This was really too strange!</p>
 <p>“Miss, this is the case.” Seeing nothing had happened to Murong Qi Qi, Fang Tong let out a sigh of relief. Then, he reported how the situation was at that time to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>It turned out that today, Tong Bao Zhai had opened like usual. When the morning passed halfway, suddenly a group of people came looking for trouble at Tong Bao Zhai. Talking till here, Fang Tong especially looked once at Feng Cang. “They weren’t <em>guye</em>’s[4. Guye: son-in-law, used by the servants of the female family] people.”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong’s <em>‘guye’</em> let Feng Cang’s nervous heart calmed down a bit. It seemed that the personality of this old man wasn’t bad. Although they had brought him over to here, but he didn’t turn right from wrong.</p>
 <p>“Then who was it?”</p>
 <p>“It was Wu Ji Gong’s people. The ones who came with them were the guards of the capital. With the excuse of searching for fugitives, they arrested our people.”</p>
 <p>Wu Ji Gong? The guards of the capital? Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi narrowed their eyes at the same time. Behind Wu Ji Gong was the crown prince. They knew this. Besides, the army was used. It seemed that there was definitely someone behind this.</p>
 <p>“Later, there was a dispute and we fought. According to miss, when meeting with trouble, protecting the lives of the brothers was the most important. Moreover, ordinary people shouldn’t fight with officials. We hadn’t figured out the matter yet. We couldn’t go head to head with the court. So, this subordinate, according to the usual way, let the brothers retreat.”</p>
 <p>After everyone retreated, Wu Ji Gong’s people found it dull. They smashed and robbed for a while and then left. Not long after, Fang Tong came back to look at the situation. Unexpectedly, he had encountered Nalan Xin. Although, he was strong, but Nalan Xin seemed to be one level higher and captured him to bring him here.</p>
 <p>“The situation was like this. As for what miss said, Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai being burned, this subordinate indeed doesn’t know who did it.”</p>
 <p>While saying this, Fang Tong looked at Nalan Xin as if wanting him to give an explanation.</p>
 <p>“Did you do it?” Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to open her mouth, Su Yue came to Nalan Xin and looked at him with disbelief, “That day, meeting you at Tong Bao Zhai’s entrance wasn’t accidental, was it? You were following me, am I right?”</p>
 <p>“Uh…,”Facing Su Yue’s questioning, Nalan Xin didn’t deny.</p>
 <p>“I admit that I followed you. However, I really didn’t let people burn down Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai! When I went, the store was in a mess. At Jue Se Fang, I saw this elder and invited him over. I really didn’t do the other things! <em>Wangye </em>only said to bring the people here and didn’t say to set it on fire!”</p>
 <p>A ‘wangye’ let Murong Qi Qi’s gaze turn to Feng Cang. She slowly walked to Feng Cang, raised her head and looked seriously at Feng Cang, “Cang, don’t you think you should explain this matter? Why do you need to kidnap my people?”</p>
 <p>“This…” Feng Cang laughed embarrassingly. How to let him say it? Could he say to Murong Qi Qi: because of you, I’ve eaten your vinegar? Isn’t this a tongue-twister…?</p>
 <p>“Talk!” Murong Qi Qi snapped. Nalan Xin’s heart almost jumped out.</p>
 <p>Just now, when he got to know that Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>was actually Murong Qi Qi, Nalan Xin wanted to die. What a thing! <em>Wangye </em>ate&nbsp;vinegar for whatever reason and caused him (NX) to offend <em>wangfei</em>.[5. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank] How should he spend his days in the future? Why did all unlucky things fall on him?!</p>
 <p>“I was jealous.” Feng Cang’s voice was very small as if he was afraid that others would hear.</p>
 <p>After hearing that the person in red was a woman and that she was the new wife master had taken, the spectating underlings beside Feng Cang all raised their thumbs in their hearts for Murong Qi Qi. Only such a woman was worthy of their master! This hot temper, this powerful personality and also those vicious attacks, all showed that she was the woman heaven had arranged for Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>Now, it seemed <em>surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple</em>, a family member didn’t know the other family member. Now, there’s a good play to watch! These people had forgotten how Murong Qi Qi fiercely taught them a lesson just now. Now, they formed a circle and wanted to see if mistress would ‘teach a lesson’ to their master.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple: a dispute between close people who fail to recognize each other</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Louder!” Not waiting for Feng Cang to finish, Murong Qi Qi roared again.</p>
 <p>Now, an obscure anger was scurrying everywhere in her body. Feng Cang actually let people kidnap her people? Her shops had been destroyed and now, they still didn’t know who the culprit is? All these things were stacked together and the spearheads pointed at Feng Cang, making Murong Qi Qi unable to not get angry.</p>
 <p>“I was jealous!” Feng Cang also roared. His eyes stared at Murong Qi Qi’s face which had become red from anger.</p>
 <p>“The moment I knew you were Du Xian Er, I began to eat vinegar! The whole <em>jianghu</em> said that Du Xian Er and Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>were a pair of immortals.&nbsp; When you and I married, Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>also bet heavily on you, making me unable to not think about the relationship between you two! You’re my <em>wangfei</em>, who does Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>think he is to steal my <em>wangfei</em>? I was jealous. So jealous, I went crazy and wished that I could kill this rival, alright?!”</p>
 <p>Such a long speech, Feng Cang yelled it in one take. After the roar, the image he had in the heart of his underlings, immediately collapsed. It turned out to be like this! Because of eating vinegar, master had actually fought with mistress! Master, ah!</p>
 <p>After a silent while, Murong Qi Qi’s tight face suddenly loosened. With a ‘puchi…’ sound, she laughed out loud.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! You, this fool! You actually ate vinegar because of me!” The woman in red trembled from laughing under the moonlight.</p>
