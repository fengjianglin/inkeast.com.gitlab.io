 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 152 (Part 1) Misha’s test</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian’s heart was undergoing a painful struggle.</p>
 <p>On one side was the clean and clear eyes of the young man, making her unable to deceive him. However, on the other side, was her background…Xi Qi’s prime minister Murong Tai had died. She’s now an orphan and didn’t have anyone to rely on. If she leaves Misha, she may not able to survive. Perhaps, she would be thrown back into prison and continue to live the tragic life of before.</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian struggled for a long time between truth and lies, between being favored and being abused. When she saw the strong pampering feeling in Misha’s eyes, Murong Qing Lian finally made a choice. She didn’t want to live so petty and low. She would use this identity of ‘Lian’ to let herself rise up again.</p>
 <p>While Murong Qing Lian was thinking, she didn’t notice the strange radiance that flashed in Misha’s eyes as he looked at her.</p>
 <p>At this time, a pretty but cold woman entered the room with a bowl of soup, “Young master, the soup is done!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Xia Xue!” Misha seemed to be kind and gentle to everyone, making Murong Qing Lian feel even more sure that relying on this man was the right thing to do.</p>
 <p>So, this woman is called Xia Xue…Murong Qing Lian recalled the name Xia Xue. Previously, when Misha had returned with her, he'd ordered Xia Xue to bathe her. Xia Xue rejected and said, “I only serve young master”. Only then did Misha buy a new maid to serve Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>At that time, Murong Qing Lian was a bit puzzled as to how a slave could boldly reject an owner like that. Looking at Xia Xue, who had been putting on a cold face and didn’t have any smiles, she placed Xia Xue in her heart. Now, she realised what her name really meant. Xue (snow) was very consistent with her personality.</p>
 <p>Misha took the black chicken soup from Xia Xue. He scooped up some with a spoon and fed it to Murong Qing Lian, “Xia Xue’s skills are the best. I believe that you will certainly like it!”</p>
 <p>Misha’s pure smile, coupled with his gentle tone, made Murong Qing Lian’s eyes get a layer of warm moisture.</p>
 <p>It seemed that aside from her biological parents, Murong Tai and Liu Yan Zhi, no one else had ever treated her like this. Especially after arriving to Bei Zhou; after experiencing so many things, suddenly someone cared so much for her. The moisture in Murong Qing Lian’s eyes gathered together and became a vast ocean.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter, Lian?”</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Misha put down the bowl in his hand. He reached out and touched Murong Qing Lian’s scarred face, “Why are you crying?”</p>
 <p>“Why are you so good to me?” The moment her words came out, Murong Qing Lian didn’t hold back her tears any longer and let them fall.</p>
 <p>“Because I’m your big brother, ah!” Murong Qing Lian’s voice was slow but full of love and tenderness, as if he was a key that had been moulded to slowly open Murong Qing Lian’s heart.</p>
 <p>“Big brother…,” Murong Qing Lian couldn’t hold back and jumped into Misha’s arms. “Woo, woo, woo, big brother…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian herself wasn’t clear if this ‘brother’ had come from her heart or with ulterior motives. The only thing she knew now was that she needed the person in front of her. No matter if it was his gentleness or his power, these were all the things she needed.</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian’s tears stained Misha’s shoulder. When Xia Xue saw this, she frowned slightly. Then, her expression became cold again. However, Misha, this involved party, merely laughed, “Lian, you’re already so big and you’re still crying! It seems…that it has been many years since you last shed a tear. Now, you’re like a child, making people reminisce, ah!”</p>
 <p>Because she was certainly, definitely sure that she wanted to follow Misha, so she was particularly careful about every word that came from Misha. In particular, when he'd said that this woman called Lian hadn’t cried for a long time, Murong Qing Lian immediately left Misha’s arms. She didn’t take the time to care about the tears hurting her scars and roughly wiped her face twice.</p>
 <p>“It’s only because I know that I have a brother now, so I’m very happy, very happy! Big brother, I won’t cry in the future anymore!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian acting like this, Misha smile was even more gentle. He reached out. His warm fingertips touched the whip marks on Murong Qing Lian’s face. “Look at you, crying like a little cat. Need to apply medicine again!”</p>
 <p>After Misha applied medicine on Murong Qing Lian’s face, the black chicken soup now had the perfect warm temperature. In order to make Misha happy, Murong Qing Lian took the chicken soup and drank it with big gulps. After drinking it, Murong Qing Lian acted like a pet. She looked at Misha as if she was saying, see how well-behaved I am, am I not?!</p>
 <p>In contrast to what Murong Qing Lian expected, on Misha’s gentle face appeared a strange smile, “Lian, you previously hated chicken soup the most, especially black chicken soup. You said that a dark soup was like an herbal tea. You don’t like drinking herbal teas…Why do you like black chicken soup now?”</p>
 <p>Oh no! Misha’s words let Murong Qing Lian’s heartbeat accelerate. What should she do? She was eager to pretend to be ‘Lian’, but she had forgotten to understand the past of this woman called ‘Lian’. Now, she’s about <em>to reveal the cloven foot</em>!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Reveal the cloven foot: to reveal a hidden purpose</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Presumably, <em>a cornered dog will jump over the wall</em>. After a moment of surprise, Murong Qing Lian chuckled, “Big brother, I already told you, I’m not Lian, but you didn’t believe me. I don’t know who I am. I also don’t know where I came from. Even more, I don’t know my name or surname…I only remember the dark days of the prison. The endless beating every day. The other things, I don’t know…”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>A cornered dog will jump over the wall: to be driven to a desperate action</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Had to say, the members of the Murong family all had great acting abilities. While saying these words, Murong Qing Lian bit her lips and tried very hard to hold back the tears that had gathered together. That stubborn and strong appearance was somewhat similar to a certain person from Misha’s memory.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, Lian. It’s big brother’s fault!” This time, Misha took the initiative to put Murong Qing Lian in his arms. “Big brother had forgotten that we'd been separated for so long. So long, that Lian had forgotten me. So long, that Lian had even forgotten yourself.”</p>
 <p>After finally breaking through this trial, Murong Qing Lian’s heart let out a sigh of relief, but her nerves were still tight. It seemed that she should pay more attention to this ‘Lian’s’ information. She couldn’t let Misha find out that she wasn’t ‘Lian’.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, what is my name?” Murong Qing Lian asked a question in a low muffled voice.</p>
 <p>“Yi Lian…this was the name adoptive father gave you, because ‘fondly attachment’…”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>伊莲 (yīlián): he/she lotus…is almost a homophone to 依恋 (yīliàn): fondly attachment, not wish to part with, to cling to</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>While Misha said this, Murong Qing Lian could clearly sense the fondness and slight sweetness in this young man’s voice. Could it be that ‘Lian’ was his little sister and lover? Since it was adoptive father, these two may not be biological siblings…</p>
 <p>In just a moment, Murong Qing Lian thought she knew the truth about ‘Lian’'s and Misha’s relationship. It seemed that she should make good use of this identity!</p>
 <p>“Yi Lian is a nice name! In the future, my name is Yi Lian!”</p>
 <p>Although Murong Qing Lian’s face was covered in whip marks, but while saying the name ‘Yi Lian’, her smile was so innocent, making Misha’s expression ease a lot.</p>
 <p>“Lian, rest well! When you’re better, big brother will take revenge for you!”</p>
 <p>After comforting Murong Qing Lian, Misha covered her in a blanket. Xia Xue pushed Misha and they both left the room.</p>
 <p>When the door was closed, Murong Qing Lian opened her eyes and let out of a sigh of relief. Finally, she had passed the test! Looking at the roof, Murong Qing Lian clenched her fists. When she was in the prison, she'd been worried that she would die there and that no one would even claim her bones. She didn’t expect that a Misha would emerge and save her.</p>
 <p>To her, Misha was her only opportunity. She must take advantage of this opportunity and live on with the identity of ‘Yi Lian’.</p>
 <p>Xia Xue pushed Misha and walked slowly in the garden. Once they'd walked far away and after a long silence, Xia Xue opened her mouth.</p>
 <p>“Young master, is it her?”</p>
 <p>Misha didn’t directly answer Xia Xue’s questions, but his fingers gently tapped the handle of the wheelchair. He changed the topic to Xia Yun Xi, “How did princess Yun die?”</p>
 <p>“Bei Zhou’s consort De stabbed her to death because she killed second prince Wanyan Yi.” Xia Xue told Misha the case. After Misha heard the process, he laughed, “Xia Xue, what do you think Xia Jin would do? Will he take revenge for his daughter or swallow this?”</p>
 <p>“What does young master hope for?” Like Misha, Xia Xue also evaded the question and threw it back to Misha. Seeing Xia Xue acting like this, Misha laughed. Under his thick eyelashes, a large gloominess appeared.</p>
 <p>“Depends on the mood…If the mood is good, then fight. If the mood is bad, then look at a play. I’ve been idle for so long. It’s time to find something to do!”</p>
 <p>Misha’s answer was a bit unscrupulous, but to Xia Xue, this was her master’s true temperament.</p>
 <p>Although Misha was Penglai island’s great master Taixu’s grand disciple, but great master Taixu went into seclusion a long time ago. Every affair on Penglai Island was handled by Misha. Everyone thought that he would become the next master of Penglai Island.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Dong Lu’s strength wasn’t comparable with Bei Zhou’s. If they really fought, then Dong Lu would certainly need to ask for Penglai Island’s help. By then, help or don’t help, wasn’t it just a word from her master?</p>
 <p>In Misha’s eyes, Xia Yun Xi’s death was only the end of a human life. So, when she was cremated, only Jia Lan was present.</p>
 <p>Looking at the raging fire wrapping Xia Yun Xi in front of him, Jia Lan felt a sense of sadness. Although Xia Yun Xi was only a disciple of Penglai Island by name and they usually didn’t have much contact with each other, but a young life was lost so early, making people couldn’t help but pity her. It was just, to say it was karma or retribution was a bit overboard. &nbsp;However, hadn't this been caused by her?</p>
 <p>These past two days, the atmosphere in Bei Zhou’s capital Yan capital was a bit strange. Wanyan Yi had died, Lin Ke Xin went crazy; in between was also the death of Dong Lu’s princess. No one knew how this matter would develop. The officials also tried to figure it out many times. It was just, no one dared to say his thoughts out loud.</p>
 <p>It was just a simple palace banquet, but it had ended in such tragedy. Although everyone had seen how the things had happened, but no one could have said for sure what kind of conspiracy was there behind these actions in the end. After all, Wanyan Yi had been the best candidate for the position of crown prince. Now, he’s gone. People couldn’t help but be suspicious of the biggest beneficiary of all this…Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“All are pigs!” After Murong Qi Qi heard some of the rumors, she revealed a mocking smile. “If we had the intention to take this throne, it would’ve been done by rebelling directly with an army! When was there a need to use such an underhanded method?! They're really humiliating our standards!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>In Chinese, pigs are used to describe someone stupid</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Alright, don’t be angry anymore! If you get sick from anger, it wouldn’t be beautiful!”</p>
 <p>No matter how the rumors were outside, Feng Cang still continued on his path. At night, he would sneak into Long Autumn palace and then sneak out in the morning.</p>
 <p>After jumping over the wall the last few times, Feng Cang seemed to have gotten an interest in jumping over walls that he never had before. Every time he came there, he was on time, so that the person in black who was ‘surveilling’ them didn’t have to guess when this Nan Lin <em>wang </em>[1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank] would appear and when he would leave.</p>
 <p>Not only at night, during the day, after the morning court, the first thing for Feng Cang would do was also report at Murong Qi Qi’s.</p>
 <p>“I don’t care about what the others think. I’m only worried about ah Kang…That day, he didn’t come and wasn’t present at the scene. He didn’t see what had happened. If he heard those rumors, I’m afraid that it will create a distance between you. After all, you were brothers who grew up together. I don’t want you and ah Kang to break your friendship because of a misunderstanding!”</p>
 <p>On the day of the palace banquet, Wanyan Kang happened to be sent away on a task by Wanyan Lie. He wasn’t at the scene. Only when he returned, did he find out about what had happened at the palace banquet.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi hadn’t seen Wanyan Kang these past two days. When she sent people to inquire, that person said that Wanyan Kang was keeping Lin Ke Xin company at Jingxing Hall. Murong Qi Qi was worried about Wanyan Kang and even more worried that this matter would affect Wanyan Kang and Feng Cang’s friendship.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang didn’t have many friends. It was hard to come by someone who cared about family and friendship the way Wanyan Kang did for Feng Cang. However, now he had to face a conflict between family and friendship. She didn’t know if Wanyan Kang could look at this matter with a fair mentality.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing…,” Seeing Murong Qi Qi worry about him, Feng Cang’s heart felt warm. He gently kissed Murong Qi Qi’s face. “You already said that I and ah Kang are brothers who grew up together. We would never separate.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s words showed his stance. No matter what happened, he wouldn’t stand at the opposite side of Wanyan Kang.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Feng Cang really saw Wanyan Kang as a friend, Murong Qi Qi was very happy. She knew the loneliness of being at the top. So, for Feng Cang, having a sincere friendship was very precious to him. She hoped that Wanyan Kang would also treat Feng Cang the way Feng Cang treated him.</p>
 <p>While the two were chatting, Su Yue said that Wanyan Kang had come. Hearing this news, Murong Qi Qi stood up happily, “Quickly, let him come in!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang came in with a pair of red eyes. It was obvious that he hadn’t sleep well. Plus, the fact that he'd cried made this pair of handsome eyes look dispirited and listless now.</p>
 <p>“Ah Kang, you came!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Wanyan Kang once again, Murong Qi Qi was very happy. She quickly gave a glance to Su Yue to let her call Su Mei over.</p>
 <p>“Cousin brother, cousin-in-law...,” Wanyan Kang’s voice was a bit hoarse. Murong Qi Qi personally poured water for him. After drinking the water, Wanyan Kang seemed a lot better.</p>
 <p>“How’s your consort mother?” Murong Qi Qi knew that it’s better for Feng Cang to not ask some things. She took the initiative to be the middleman and asked for news of Lin Ke Xin.</p>
 <p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi mention Lin Ke Xin, Wanyan Kang laughed bitterly once. He shook his head, “Consort mother doesn’t drink and doesn’t eat. She only held second big brother’s clothes and kept calling second brother’s name.”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang gave a simple description of Lin Ke Xin’s current situation. Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang could imagine what kind of scene that would be. Such a strong woman becoming like this now was really like the day and night. However, if she hadn't manipulated people, how could she have fallen to this point?!</p>
 <p>Seeing Wanyan Kang’s haggard look, Murong Qi Qi couldn’t help but think back to Wanyan Kang’s sad look at the sixth level test at the pagoda. Lin Ke Xin’s heart only had her eldest son Wanyan Yi. When had she thought about the feelings of her youngest son?! Till now, what her heart was thinking about was still Wanyan Yi. How could Wanyan Kang not be sad?</p>
 <p>“Cousin brother, cousin-in-law, I came today to ask you one thing.”</p>
 <p>After telling Lin Ke Xin’s situation, Wanyan Kang’s expression became a bit serious. His eyes also revealed a serious stubbornness.</p>
 <p>As if he guessed that Wanyan Kang would say this, Feng Cang nodded, “Ask, as long as I know it, I will tell you the truth.”</p>
