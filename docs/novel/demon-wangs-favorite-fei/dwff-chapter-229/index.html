 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 205 (Part 1) Love is in sky of affection (4)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Su Mei mouth didn’t have mercy on people. The round moon dagger in her hand flew out and directly cut off the iron hook on the left hand of Taji Guli.</p>
 <p>“Really…a rubbish!” After retrieving the round moon dagger, Su Mei looked coldly at Taji Guli. “Such a rubbish still dared to covet our <em>guye</em>[1. Guye: son-in-law, also used by the servants of the mistress' family], really delusional!”</p>
 <p>“You! I want to kill you!” Taji Guli’s angrily shouted once and rushed at Su Mei.</p>
 <p>“Overconfident!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei faced Taji Guli. Wanyan Kang crossed his arms and retreated to a side. “Little Mei <em>er</em>[2. Er: term of endearment], teach this ugly thing who have no sense of shame a lesson! Let her know how amazing you are!”</p>
 <p>That Wanyan Kang didn’t help his <em>wangfei</em>[3. Wangfei: main conosrt of the first-rank prince] and instead fanned the fire at a side made Ming Yue Cheng couldn’t help but laugh, “Xiaoyao <em>wang</em>[4. Wang/wangye: the first-rank prince] is really a true temperament person!”</p>
 <p>“To deal with such an ugly thing, my little Mei <em>er</em> only need ten strikes. If I intervene, little Mei <em>er</em> will certainly blame me for being too meddlesome!”</p>
 <p>That Wanyan Kang repeatedly said ‘ugly thing’ deeply irritated Taji Guli’s sensitive heart. Which women don’t love beauty? Even she hoped to be as beautiful as Feng Qi Qi. However, her face was ruined. Now, she had become like this and Wanyan Kang repeatedly used ‘ugly thing’ to call her, how could she be willing?</p>
 <p>“Bastard! You both are bastards!” Taji Guli already lost her mind. The nine-section whip in her hand flew towards Wanyan Kang but was dodged by Wanyan Kang.</p>
 <p>“Ugly thing, don’t disgrace yourself, ah! <em>Benwang&lt;/em&gt;[5. Benwang: this king, I used by the first-rank prince] will take into consideration that you are a crippled person and don’t argue with you. However, don’t want a foot just because I give an inch!”</em></p>
 <p>The words ‘cripple’ and ‘ugly thing’ destructive power was beyond reach. At this time, Taji Guli’s head had lost its mind because of anger. She didn’t care how Wanyan Kang escaped, she confronted him.</p>
 <p>“Guli, that’s a psychological game!” Duyi, as a bystander, wanted to remind Taji Guli, let her wake up and not fall into Wanyan Kang’s evil trap. But how could those words enter the furious Taji Guli’s ears.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Taji Guli attacked, Wanyan Kang smiled naughtily and dodged once again. He liked to destroy people mentally like this. Like that, it was very satisfactory.</p>
 <p>Duyi wanted to help Taji Guli, but was stopped by Longze Jing Tian. “Duyi, she had gone crazy.”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s words were very obvious. Taji Guli had gone crazy. They couldn’t go crazy with Taji Guli. The most important thing in front of him now was to deal with Feng Cang. They couldn’t lose their sense because of Taj Guli.</p>
 <p>Hearing Longze Jing Tian said that, Su Mei laughed, “She really is a pitiful person. She doesn’t even know that she had been used as a chest piece and had been thrown away. Husband, such a woman is already very pitiful, don’t strike her fragile heart anymore. Why don’t you yield three strokes to her?!”</p>
 <p>“Good! I’ll listen to little Mei <em>er</em>. Taking into account that you had been thrown away by your owner, I will yield three strikes to you!”</p>
 <p>Both Wanyan Kang and Su Mei have sharp mouths that wouldn’t spare people. Now, Taji Guli had completely gone crazy. The nine-section whip in her hand also lost its sense and had been attacking Wanyan Kang and Su Mei.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>At that side, the fight was in full swing. At this side, Feng Qi Qi’s gaze hadn’t left Feng Xiao for a moment. This child didn’t seem afraid at all. For a moment, he looked at Longze Jing Tian and for a moment, he looked at Duyi. He even smiled at them making Gu De and the four elders greatly surprised.</p>
 <p>It was already such a situation, this baby could still be so calm. If it was an ordinary child, that child would’ve cried from being scared. This child wasn’t afraid at all. Instead, it smiled at people. When they looked again, they saw that the child had a pair of deep purple eyes. This made the elders even more surprised. Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi had black eyes, why does the child have purple eyes?</p>
 <p>“If you return the child to me, I will let you go today.” Feng Cang still had a cold expression and repeated the sentence of just now.</p>
 <p>“You will let us go?” Longze Jing Tian laughed. His big hand stroked Feng Xiao’s head. “Feng Cang, do you think he can bear it if my hand goes on like this?”</p>
 <p>“If you dare to hurt Xiao <em>er</em>, I will let you be buried with him!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s words made the smile on Longze Jing Tian’s face become bigger. “I had long been a dead person. Dead is nothing to me. However, little <em>shizi</em>[6. Shizi: heir of the first-rank prince, usually born by the main wife] has just been born. His life has just begun, but will have to be buried with me. The life of the dead for the life of a newborn really makes people happy! Moreover, you would feel guilty your whole life about your weak protection and continue to remember me. This makes me even happier.”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s words were a bit disorderly, making people unable to guess the meaning. Feng Cang understood his implied meaning. Even if Longze Jing Tian died, he wanted to let Feng Qi Qi remember him for her whole life. Even if it was in the name of hate. This person really had gone crazy!</p>
 <p>“My son won’t die. The one who will die is you!”</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi didn’t care about the meaning of the sadness in Longze Jing Tian’s words. The golden thread in her hand already had gone straight at Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>“Ha…” Feng Qi Qi attacked, how could Feng Cang just stand by and watch? A white light flashed and he appeared in front of Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>However, Longze Jing Tian was also not someone easy to deal with. He seemed to have long expected that the two would attack. He held Feng Xiao and retreated like the wind.</p>
 <p>“Give me back the child!”</p>
 <p>How would Feng Qi Qi give Longze Jing Tian the opportunity to retreat? The golden thread went to his back and sealed his retreat. When Duyi saw that Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi picked Longze Jing Tian, how could he stand by and watch? He immediately drew his sword and went against Feng Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Humph!” Seeing that someone blocked her, Feng Qi Qi sneered. The golden threads in her hand flashed and entangled Duyi.</p>
 <p>Duyi now felt that it was the wrong choice to pick Feng Qi Qi. He had only heard some rumors regarding Feng Qi Qi. The rumors didn’t mention how her martial arts was. However, now it seemed that it was as what Taji Guli said. This woman couldn’t be belittled.</p>
 <p>It seemed a little late for Duyi to think so. Every attack of Feng Qi Qi was to take his life, making him change from attacking to a difficult defense. Feng Qi Qi’s attacks were vicious and unrelenting. In just a while, a dense layer of sweat appeared on Duyi’s forehead.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Duyi was Penglai Island’s second great disciple. Ming Yue Cheng had explained his identity to the four elders. Now, Feng Qi Qi attacked Penglai Island’s disciple, making him have no way of retaliating, made these people even more surprised.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t expect that this girl’s cultivation to be so high….,” Second elder didn’t finish his sentence, but the others understood what he meant. Feng Qi Qi was so young but was able to reach the ninth level. She was really a rare genius of the world.</p>
 <p>“She’s so powerful. The regent is also a powerful figure!”</p>
 <p>Gu De’s words led everyone’s eyes from Feng Qi Qi to Feng Cang who was fighting with Longze Jing Tian. Because Feng Xiao was in Longze Jing Tian’s hand, every time Feng Cang launched an attack, Longze Jing Tian would put Feng Xiao in front to block the attack, making it so that Feng Cang had no way but to retrieve his attack. It was the kind of feeling that a string of arrows was blocked in the middle of the road. This made people feel that Feng Cang was even deeper and unmeasurable.</p>
 <p>Even the elders on the scene wouldn’t be able to control the force so naturally and stop the attack instantly. How strong was his level of control?!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Originally, Ming Yue Cheng wanted to help. After he saw Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi launch an attack, he retreated to a side. Looking at the red and white figure fighting in the air, Ming Yue Cheng felt that he had always been an outsider. These two people were a match made from heaven. Their appearance and ability were very strong. They matched in all aspects. They were really a match made from heaven. Others simply couldn’t get in between.</p>
 <p>The expression of Ming Yue Cheng was exposed to the eyes of Gu De. Gu De couldn't help but sigh. He had watched Ming Yue Cheng grew up. He (MYC) was now the ruler of a country and had managed Nan Feng well and orderly. Gu De had to say that he (MYC) was a very good emperor. But in the matter of love, he was persistent just like the late empress. This was the only bad thing about Ming Yue Cheng.</p>
 <p>He (GD) hoped that after seeing the scene in front of him (MYC), Ming Yue Cheng would open the knot in his heart and accept other women. Otherwise, how should the dynasty of Nan Feng be continued? This was really a headache!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Before Gu De could finish his thoughts, all he heard was a scream. Taji Guli fell from the air and Su Mei’s round moon dagger directly cut off her neck. The screams of Taji Guli made Duyi distracted. After hearing the whistling sound, Duyi shouted, "Not good." The golden threads of Feng Qi Qi were tightly wrapped around his neck.</p>
 <p>“Kacha….” The sound of fracture of the neck bone was heard clearly by Duyi. He never thought that he would die like this. Duyi was somewhat unwilling to accept it. He felt that he lived this life stupidly and cowardly. At Penglai Island, he was suppressed by Misha. Here, he was suppressed by Longze Jing Tian, and now he had to die at the hands of a woman. He couldn't accept it.</p>
 <p>However, all the unwillingness was ended with that ‘kacha’ sound. His life had come to an end here. So many unwillingness, he could never strike back.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>The death of Taji Guli and Duyi made Longze Jing Tian’s eyes gloomy. Feng Cang’s attacks were too fierce. If Feng Xiao wasn't in his hands, he wouldn't be able to take on it. Now that his two companions were dead, he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to walk away today.</p>
 <p>After seeing the red dress of Feng Qi Qi appear in front of his eyes, Longze Jing Tian’s heart hardened and he plunged right into the dragon pool.</p>
 <p>“Feng Cang, Feng Qi Qi, if you dare to come over, I’ll throw the child into the water to feed the fish!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian could swim, so he was now swimming towards the centre of the dragon pool, while his other hand held Feng Xiao. The delicate neck of Feng Xiao was scratched by Longze Jing Tian and blood poured out. After feeling the pain, Feng Xiao finally made a cry once.</p>
 <p>“Xiao <em>er</em>….” The wounds were on Feng Xiao’s body but it hurt the heart of Feng Qi Qi. Feng Qi Qi wanted to go over regardless of anything but was stopped by Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“Longze Jing Tian, what do you want?”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian was clearly prepared a life or death struggle afterhe had brought Feng Xiao into the water. That was why he cut through the neck of Feng Xiao and wanted to use his (FX) blood to attract the creatures of the water in the pool. This person (LJT) was really vicious.</p>
 <p>“What do I want?” After hearing Feng Cang’s words, Longze Jing Tian stopped and looked at the snow-white dressed Feng Cang on the shore. He laughed out in tears, “Will you give me anything I want? I want you to kneel down? Will you?”</p>
 <p>The words of Longze Jing Tian made Wanyan Kang furious, “What are you? You actually want my cousin to kneel down?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang didn't finish his words yet, Longze Jing Tian had made a cut on Feng Xiao’s small hands with the knife. “Feng Cang, do you want to watch your son die or is your dignity more important? I want you to kneel down for me, kneel down!”</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was heavy on the field. Everyone looked at the crazy man in the dragon pool. The sound of Feng Xiao’s cries slowly came through, though not loud, but Feng Cang’s heart still felt as painful as a knife cut.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you don't like this child so much! Hahahaha….”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian didn't finish laughing, Feng Cang lifted up his white clothes and knelt down on the ground.</p>
 <p>The kneeling of Feng Cang was unexpected to Longze Jing Tian. When he saw that proud man kneel in front of him now, Longze Jing Tian laughed madly, “Hahahaha! Feng Cang, you didn't think that this day will come, right? Hahaha! Someone so proud like you is actually kneeling in front of me! Hahaha!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s madness made people furious. Feng Qi Qi’s tears flowed down after watching this man beside her kneel. On one side was her child who she carried for ten months, and on the other side was her lover of this life. How could this not make her sad?</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi shedding tears made Longze Jing Tian’s smile become stiff. His eyes were like a vicious snake and glanced at Feng Cang, “The first condition, you did it, very well; the second, I want Feng Qi Qi to go with me!”</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” Not waiting for Longze Jing Tian to finish his words, Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi spoke out at the same time. The tacit understanding of the two made Longze Jing Tian’s eyes darken, “So, you two want to watch Feng Xiao’s die? I thought that you loved your child very much, but I didn't expect that the one you two love are each other, ah!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian once again made a cut on Feng Xiao’s hands. The red blood ran down from Feng Xiao’s fair arms and formed a sharp contrast with the white arms of Feng Xiao. Drop by drop, the blood fell in the water, forming a ripple of light red, spreading in circles and submerged in the water.</p>
