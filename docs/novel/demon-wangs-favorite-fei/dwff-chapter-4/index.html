 <p>Chapter 4: The Fight</p>
 <p>“No, nothing.”</p>
 <p>In just a moment, Murong Xin Lian returned back to normal.</p>
 <p>Looking at that ordinary face without any special trait, Murong Xin Lian’s heart felt another round of unwillingness. Everything about her was better than Murong Qi Qi's, but her humble origin was a thorn inserted deep in her heart. Moving slightly, the pain would make her unable to breath, really uncomfortable!</p>
 <p>“Second big sister could it be that you are jealous of third big sister?! I heard that you really admire Jing <em>wangye</em>[1. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank], ah!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian grinned with a face full of innocence.</p>
 <p>“Such a pity, ah! Jing w<em>angye</em> and third big sister already have an arranged marriage. This is probably the so called fools have fool’s luck! Second big sister, you and I don’t have that life. We might as well take the time to upgrade ourselves and become the champion at the competition between the four countries. Maybe you will then get an ideal husband!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian had an innocent face, but every word coming out of her mouth was like a thorn. These words seemed like they were consoling Murong Xin Lian, but actually they were fanning the fire. They only lacked oil to put on the fire.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the women from great families were not easy to deal with!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi continued to put an innocent expression and did as if she didn’t understand Murong Qing Lian’s words.</p>
 <p>Being stimulated like that by Murong Qing Lian, Murong Xin Lian’s resentment was like a snowball; the more you roll it, the bigger it got. She also knew that Murong Qing Lian was waiting for her to make a joke of herself, but what the other party has said was the truth. The future Jing <em>wangfei</em>[2. Wangfei: the main wife/consort of the prince of first rank] was standing in front of her. This was something that no matter what she did, she couldn’t ignore.</p>
 <p>But even though her heart was uncomfortable, she couldn’t afford to lose to Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“The way fourth little sister speaks is really interesting. Jing <em>wang </em>is good at everything. The feelings I have for him is like worshipping a hero! Third little sister have such blessing is her good fortune, isn’t that right?!”</p>
 <p>“Hehe……,” Murong Qing Lian chuckled loudly.</p>
 <p>“Second big sister, if you really like Jing w<em>angye</em>, you might as well beg third big sister to let her speak good things of you and make Jing <em>wang </em>take you in. Although a <em>cefei</em>[3. Cefei: side consort/ second ranked wife of the prince of first rank] couldn’t be compared to a main wife, but it was still more decent than a concubine. Little sister's planning wholeheartedly for you, ah!”</p>
 <p>While bullying Murong Qi Qi, these two sisters were one mind, but privately these two people were not satisfied with each other.</p>
 <p>The reason was very simple. Although Murong Tai had seven concubines, but the ones he pampered the most were these two’s mothers and that was why they were born. And their mothers were also rivals of each other. The two’s struggle would of course continue on the next generation.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian saw that Murong Qing Lian was ridiculing her in front of Murong Qi Qi, her expression immediately fell.</p>
 <p>“Fourth little sister, what do you mean? Are you bullying me because I’m from the illegitimate line? Don’t forget, you are also from the illegitimate line! Later when you get married, you will also only be a concubine!”</p>
 <p>“Second big sister don’t have to worry about this!”</p>
 <p>After listening to Murong Xin Lian’s words, Murong Qin Lian snorted. She had long hated Murong Xin Lian’s actions. Now she (MXL) was talking words with thorns, Murong Qing Lian was also not easy to deal with.</p>
 <p>“Daddy said that as long as I can get a place in the athletics tournaments, he will find me a good husband. But second big sister, you have trained so hard, but you are still only at the third level. If I were you, I will hide my face with my sleeves in shame and wouldn’t come out to meet with people!”</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian knew that her talent in martial arts was not as high as Murong Qing Lian's. This was also exactly why when they fought, Murong Tai would be biased towards Murong Qing Lian. Now Murong Qing Lian was obviously humiliating her, how could Murong Xin Lian accept this?</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian grit her teeth, Murong Qing Lian was in a good mood. She put her hand on her mouth and snickered.</p>
 <p>“Aiya, I’ve forgotten, second big sister is now the number one beauty of the capital, how can this face be hidden? You should let people see it more often! Maybe someone will fancy your beauty and directly carry you into a room. Then, you can tell daddy about this!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian had Murong Tai’s love, so she was used to being arrogant. While talking she wouldn't go easy on people. In contrast, it was Murong Xin Lian who always wanted to protect her ‘virtuous’ image. Faced with the eloquent Murong Qing Lian, Murong Xin Lian could only face defeat.</p>
 <p>Cool! Really cool! Seeing these two sisters fighting each other, Murong Qi Qi was the happiest person on the scene. What was this called? Cats and dogs! The more they fight, the happier she would be!</p>
 <p>They came with the intention to humiliate Murong Qi Qi, but in the end she was humiliated by Murong Qing Lian. How could Murong Xin Lian accept this? No matter what, Murong Qing Lian let her lost face in front of the rubbish Murong Qi Qi. This was something she absolutely couldn't accept.</p>
 <p>“Use your whip to paint her face!”</p>
 <p>While Murong Xin Lian was really furious, a voice reached her ears. Not waiting for Murong Xin Lian to understand where these words came from, her hands began to move. She raised the whip and whipped Murong Qing Lian’s face.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>The one, who just now was as proud as a peacock, immediately covered her face and screamed. She stared at the whip in Murong Xin Lian’s hand. Her eyes were full of disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Second big sister, you actually wanted to ruin my looks? Murong Xin Lian, shame on you!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qin Lian pulled out a sword and pointed it at Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>“Fourth little sister, don’t be impulsive, ah!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian like this, Murong Qi Qi's heart almost lost breath because of laughing, but she put an anxious expression.</p>
 <p>“Second big sister didn’t do it on purpose!”</p>
 <p>“Get out of my way! This is none of your business!”</p>
 <p>How would the furious Murong Qing Lian listen to Murong Qi Qi’s ‘persuasion’? The sword in her hand stabbed Murong Xin Lian at her soft spot.</p>
 <p>“Miss, be careful, ah!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s maid Fei Cui anxiously warned Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>“Zhen Zhu, beat that maid to death!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian couldn’t take Fei Cui’s expression. She immediately gave her head maid Zhen Zhu an order.</p>
 <p>“Beat her fiercely!”</p>
 <p>Receiving miss’s command, Zhen Zhu also didn’t think much, rushed and slapped Fei Cui twice in the face. Her action was fierce and skillful. After a moment, she left five fingerprints on Fei Cui’s face.</p>
 <p>“You dare to slap me?”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui was now seeing stars because of Zhen Zhu. She followed Murong Xin Lian and had always been a head maid, when had she been bullied like this? She immediately went into a fight with Zhen Zhu.</p>
 <p>“Don’t fight anymore! Second big sister, fourth little sister, if you have something to say, talk, don’t fight anymore!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi hid in the corner. From time to time, she would shout. While she was tired from shouting, Su Mei handed her a slice of melon to soothe her throat.</p>
 <p>While Murong Xin Lan’s whip shot out once again, Murong Qi Qi’s voice once again came over.</p>
 <p>“Fourth little sister, your face is bleeding. If you don’t treat it, it’ll leave scars!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s hand flicked once again and the whip went to Murong Qing Lian’s face. The whip left a print on both side, very symmetrical.</p>
 <p>“Aiya, second big sister, how can you be so cruel?! Even if you’re jealous of fourth little sister, you don’t need to be like this!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi ‘exclaimed’ in surprise.</p>
 <p>With Murong Qi Qi fanning the flames, Murong Qing Lian’s anger rose. The sword went to Murong Xin Lian’s body mercilessly. A thin hole was left in Murong Xin Lian’s left arm. Finally the sword crossed Murong Xin Lian’s forehead.</p>
