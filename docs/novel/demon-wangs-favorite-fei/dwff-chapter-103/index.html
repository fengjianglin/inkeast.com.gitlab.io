 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 103 Don’t want to answer, then I’ll kiss you (1)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words made Murong Qing Lian surprised. Her red lips trembled slightly.</p>
 <p>“What, what are you saying? I don’t understand…”</p>
 <p>“You don’t understand or are you denying it?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi sneered. The killing intent in her beautiful eyes became stronger.</p>
 <p>“Do I need to thank you for having mercy? Fortunately, you only used two nails; if you had put in twenty, then wouldn’t I have died on the spot? No…you wouldn’t&nbsp;have used so much; otherwise, it would've exposed your vicious heart. So, you only put in two. One left, one right, stabbing into my bones!”</p>
 <p>Just thinking about those things the original owner of this body had experienced, made the gaze Murong Qi Qi looked at Murong Qing Lian turn colder. Before, this pitiful person died at the hands of these vicious people! Now, she had time travelled here. If it wasn’t because she'd encountered godfather and master and got treatment in time, these pair of legs would’ve been considered destroyed.</p>
 <p>“No, no, it wasn’t me…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian shook her head and bit her lips. Murong Qi Qi actually found out that this matter was done by her. How could that be?!</p>
 <p>She just wanted to teach Murong Qi Qi a lesson. That’s why she let people put moving nails on the cracks of the wooden stick. With the first beating, those nails would go into her bones. She heard that because of this, some people’s legs had become destroyed. She didn’t expect that not only was Murong Qi Qi safe and sound, she'd also learned martial arts!</p>
 <p>When Murong Qi Qi came back, she'd only thought that she (MQQ) was lucky and that those nails had only went into her skin but didn’t hurt her bones. Now, after hearing Murong Qi Qi's words, Murong Qing Lian finally understood those nails did indeed hurt her. It’s just, even with that, she was able to survive! Truly incredible!</p>
 <p>“Oh…”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Qing Lian was nearing her death, but still acting so tight-lipped, the coldness in Murong Qi Qi’s eyes immediately melted and became very gentle and soft.</p>
 <p>“Whether or not it was you, I would still hold you accountable!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qing Lian to ponder over the plot behind Murong Qi Qi’s sweet smile, Murong Qi Qi’s hand tightened and pulled away the red muslin, which was currently wrapped around Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“Ah…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian screamed in pain. The red muslin brushed against her skin, immediately leaving a layer of tender-like,&nbsp;thin cuts. Blood instantly tainted her light colored dress.</p>
 <p>Not good! Jia Lan was shocked. He didn’t know that Murong Qi Qi could wound people like this with only a red muslin.</p>
 <p>“Sir, this is the tournament of the four countries. We can’t intervene!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Jia Lan wanted to save Murong Qing Lian, Jin Yu quickly grabbed his arm.</p>
 <p>“Not to mention how weak she is. How could she be the one sir Misha is searching for?!”</p>
 <p>Jia Lan knew that Jin Yu was right. How could the person who broke the illusion of the sixth floor be so ‘disappointing’?</p>
 <p>It’s just, before coming, Misha made it clear to him, that it’s better to recognize a thousand people wrong than to let go of one! So, in the end, whether or not this Murong Qing Lian was truly the one Misha wanted to find, they could only wait till Misha personally confirmed it. And his task was to ensure that Murong Qing Lian was still alive until Misha arrived.</p>
 <p>Just as Murong Qi Qi’s red muslin wrapped once again around Murong Qing Lian’s body, a figure in blue appeared in front of Murong Qi Qi. A silver light flashed. The fine knife in Jia Lan’s hand cut the red muslin in two.</p>
 <p>“Miss, the person already admitted defeat, why should you take a person’s life?! <em>Where it’s possible to let people off, one should spare them</em>!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Where it’s possible to let people off, one should spare them: anyone can make mistakes, forgive them when possible. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>With a never changing smile, Jia Lan’s expression was gentle and calm. The sudden appearance of Jia Lan made Murong Qi Qi surprised for a moment and also let Murong Qing Lian see hope.</p>
 <p>“Saving a life is more meritorious than building a seven floors pagoda. Besides, miss and her are family. Why the need to slaughter your own kind?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian laid panting on the ground. Those small wounds hurted so much. Seeing that someone had come to save her, Murong Qing Lian quickly crawled over and held onto Jia Lan’s leg, just like when someone fell into the water and saw a life saver. She tightly clutched Jia Lan’s clothes.</p>
 <p>“I beg you, save me. She would kill me. I beg you! Save me!”</p>
 <p>The force that came from his feet made Jia Lan frown slightly.</p>
 <p>He looked and saw that the blue clothes were tainted with blood. Jia Lan’s expression turned uglier. Although he still maintained his smile, but the knife in his hand cut off the piece that&nbsp;Murong Qing Lian was clutching on his clothes. He turned sideways, retrieved his leg and didn’t let Murong Qing Lian approach him again.</p>
 <p>He didn’t like the touch of a woman. Besides, Murong Qing Lian’s body was stained with blood. So dirty. Afraid that Murong Qing Lian would once again wrap herself around him, Jia Lan simply stood at a place far from her in order to prevent her getting close to him.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you let her off?! Do it as if you’re giving me face!”</p>
 <p>Jia Lan smiled at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“You?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was already very unhappy at being disturbed. Now, Jia Lan farted a pile of shitty words out, making Murong Qi Qi’s mood turn for the worse. She raised an eyebrow and revealed a charming smile.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? What face do you have to be qualified for me to give you face?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s voice was full of dissatisfaction. Her sarcastic words made Jia Lan surprised for a moment. For the first time, a smile did not appear on his face.</p>
 <p>That Murong Qi Qi would refuse was within the expectation of Jia Lan. Although, he didn’t overhear the conversation between Murong Qi Qi and Murong Qing Lian, but from the information he had gathered, in the past at Murong&nbsp;residence, Murong Qing Lian didn’t let this third big sister have a good life. So, the grudges between them were already there. It was not like it would be put down just because he said so.</p>
 <p>It’s just, he'd already accepted the order from Misha before coming here. Whether or not Murong Qing Lian was the person Misha wanted to find, as long as there was this possibility, then he must do the thing he'd promised Misha. Today, he would take this Murong Qing Lian under his care!</p>
 <p>“Then, what do miss want to be willing to let her go?”</p>
 <p>“Ask my red muslin if it is willing to give you face!”</p>
 <p>While Murong Qi Qi was talking, the red muslin in her hand went straight at Jia Lan’s face. However, it hadn’t touched Jia Lan yet, when it was grabbed by him.</p>
 <p>“Miss, as long as I have it, miss can ask for it. I would offer it to you with both hands. I only ask for miss to spare her life today!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was fast. Jia Lan was even faster. To be able to grab her red muslin at such a short distance; for the first time Murong Qi Qi felt that this Jia Lan was someone who couldn't be&nbsp;ignored.</p>
 <p>Since Jia Lan was a high skilled master, being in a deadlock&nbsp;with him wouldn’t bring her any good. Not to mention, the future was&nbsp;long. There would be more opportunities. Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi smiled faintly. The coldness from her body disappeared and she turned back into that gentle and weak woman.</p>
 <p>“Today, I can give you face and let her go, but you need to promise me three things.”</p>
 <p>“Good!”</p>
 <p>Jia Lan nodded. To be able to let Murong Qi Qi loosen was already not an easy thing. If it wasn’t for Misha, he wouldn’t have pleaded for someone incompetent.</p>
 <p>“The first one, bark three times.”</p>
 <p>“You…”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Jia Lan’s expression changed once again. What did she mean by this? Humiliating him? Anger appeared on Jia Lan’s face.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi saw that anger on Jia Lan’s face clearly. Although she didn’t know why Jia Lan went against the rules and helped, but he broke her good matter. She couldn’t let this pass so easily. She wanted to see how much determination did this man have to save Murong Qing Lian from her hands.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I thought you were a man and was ready to give and take! I didn’t expect that you’re just all about talking…”</p>
 <p>“Woof, woof, woof!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to finish, Jia Lan opened his mouth. Three barks came from his mouth and spread throughout the entire venue.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha!”</p>
 <p>Everyone laughed. Wanyan Kang even fell from his chair onto the ground out of&nbsp;laughter.</p>
 <p>“Aiyaya, this idea of cousin-in-law is not bad! Next time, when making a bet with someone, I’ll also do this!”</p>
 <p>Everyone’s laughter made Jia Lan's unmovable face get a touch of pink. He tried very hard to comfort himself that this was for Misha. That he would let Misha repay him back fiercely! All of these troubles were stirred up by that damn Misha!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t expect that for Murong Qing Lian, Jia Lan was willing to do till this step. What kind of secret was there? Murong Qi Qi was curious about that. Since the other party did as she asked, she also couldn’t continue to make things hard for Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>When the laughter gradually died down, Jia Lan was also a lot calmer.</p>
 <p>“What are the two other things?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know yet. Remember them first. In the future, I’ll tell you.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi lazily swept once over Jia Lan. She turned her face and looked at Murong Qing Lian who was creeping on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qing Lian, listen well! In the future, you better behave well. Next time, if you see me and still act so rude, I will beat you to death! If you have nothing to do, go pray more. Pray that next time, you would still be so lucky to have a foolish man coming&nbsp;to save you!”</p>
 <p>After he became a ‘foolish’ man from Murong Qi Qi’s point of view, Jia Lan laughed bitterly. Misha, ah, Misha, if it wasn’t because of the brotherhood between us; if it wasn’t because of the grace I&nbsp;have for you saving my life, I wouldn’t have degraded myself like this…</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Jia Lan to think more, Murong Qi Qi pulled back the red muslin from Jia Lan’s hand. When the red muslin disappeared, Jia Lan felt a pain in his palm. He spread his palm out. On his palm were numerous fine wounds. The next moment, the wounds split open and blood sprayed out.</p>
 <p>A ruthless woman! Jia Lan was surprised. He immediately pressed his acupuncture points to stop the bleeding. Just a red muslin was able to hurt him like this! How did she do it? Was&nbsp;it done by just the threads on the red muslin?</p>
 <p>“Ah, saving someone from my hands, you must also prepare yourself to suffer pain. Jia Lan, I don’t care who you are or what kind of motive you have.&nbsp; Next time, if you stop me again, it won’t be as simple as only wounding one hand!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi flicked. The red muslin flew to Murong Qing Lian’s ankle.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian screamed in pain. Her whole foot was covered with blood.</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi didn’t keep her words, Jia Lan was very angry. However, Murong Qi Qi stopped at this time.</p>
 <p>“Well! <em>Bengong</em>[1. Bengong: this palace/ I, used by females of the imperial family] also vented <em>bengong’s </em>anger. Now my spirit and mood are good! It’s still blood that is good looking. Red has the atmosphere of the New Year! Where’s the referee? Is it not time to announce the results?! <em>Bengong </em>is hungry and still needs to go back to have dinner!”</p>
 <p>The three previous&nbsp;competitions, irrespective of their outcomes, had been very uncomplicated. However, this competition truly saw blood. This made the people gain a new understanding of princess Zhao Yang.</p>
 <p>“I announce that Bei Zhou won!”</p>
 <p>When the voice of the referee spread to everyone’s ears, the citizens of Bei Zhou cheered.</p>
 <p>“We won! We won!”</p>
 <p>National pride filled everyone’s heart. They won. After twenty-five years, Bei Zhou finally became the winner of the tournament of the four countries. This was the best news they've heard in this winter!</p>
 <p>Seeing everyone so happy, Murong Qi Qi also relaxed. She stepped down the ladder and went to Feng Cang who had been waiting for her.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye,</em>[2. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank] we won!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang nodded. He gently put the fox-furred coat on her.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>They'd just taken two steps, when Murong Qi Qi stopped. She turned her head and looked at the platform. Jin Yu was bandaging Jia Lan and Murong Qing Lian also had been carried down to receive treatment. Although she had won, but letting Murong Qing Lian off made a breath choke in her heart, which she was unable to quell. Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi threw the red muslin in her hand on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Su Mei, burn it! Stained with a bitch’s blood, this red muslin has been dirtied!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei immediately picked up the red muslin, went to a side and burned it to ashes.</p>
 <p>When that ‘bitch’ from Murong Qi Qi spread to Murong Qing Lian’s ears, she couldn’t help but shiver. Fortunately, today there was Jia Lan who reached out a helping hand; otherwise, she would’ve surely died on the platform.</p>
 <p>When the word ‘bitch’ reached Jia Lan’s ears, he only chuckled. This woman really holds a grudge! Today, he saved Murong Qing Lian. Presumably, next time when he sees her (MQQ), she wouldn’t give him a good expression anymore!</p>
 <p>“Sir, doesn’t it hurt? You can still actually&nbsp;laugh!”</p>
 <p>Jin Yu carefully applied medicine for Jia Lan.</p>
 <p>“That woman is truly powerful. She could hurt someone with just a red muslin. Really couldn’t see that coming from her looks! She is way more powerful than Murong Qing Lian! I really feel that today, sir asked for it yourself! For someone useless, you hurt yourself like this. Sir Jia Lan, you are beginning to have more and more self-harm tendencies!”</p>
 <p>“Jin Yu, I’m already hurt. You still taking joy in my calamity and delight in my disaster. Don’t you know how to feel a bit for me?! See how protective Murong Qi Qi’s maids are towards her. Why is it that you've followed me for so long and still act like a thankless wretch?”</p>
 <p>“Is it still not obvious how I feel for sir? Although my words are hard to the ears, but I’m right, ah! I feel that sir cares too much about your friendship with sir Misha. Today, sir was humiliated. I’m very furious, but I know that this has nothing to do with Murong Qi Qi. The one who humiliated sir is sir yourself!”</p>
 <p>Jin Yu was not old, but every word he said was very logical. Jia Lan couldn’t help himself from shaking his head. His gaze had been following Murong Qi Qi’s back. Only when she disappeared, did he retrieve his gaze back.</p>
 <p>Seeing his bandaged right hand, in Jia Lan’s mind emerged that expression of Murong Qi Qi with the faint smile. Ai, Misha, this time, you brought a big calamity to me! I really hope that Murong Qing Lian is not the one you’re looking for. If she truly isn’t, then I would personally deliver her to that woman…</p>
 <p>Jia Lan’s hand needed some time to recover and Murong Qing Lian had nowhere to go.</p>
 <p>The doctor hadn’t even touched her yet, when she screamed that it was painful. Although the dislocated ankles and knees had been put back in place, but those fine wounds on her body felt as if they were needles piercing into her body. Especially that left foot that Murong Qi Qi had sent special greetings to just now. On all her skin, there wasn’t a&nbsp;single intact place. There were&nbsp;crisscross wounds everywhere.</p>
 <p>“Doctor, how is she?”</p>
 <p>Now, from the four contestants of Xi Qi, only Li Yun Qing was fine. Now, he had become the one to bear the responsibilities.</p>
 <p>“It’s only injury of the skin. No harm.”</p>
 <p>The doctor applied medicine for Murong Qing Lian; however, some places were too intimate. So, he could only wait till Murong Qing Lian went back and did it herself.</p>
 <p>Now, the pitiful Murong Qing Lian’s whole body would hurt very much every time she moved. Although it was the same as how that doctor said, that it was injury of the skin, but her whole body was full of fine thread-like wounds, burning with pain. When had ever she been so bitterly in pain before?!</p>
 <p>It&nbsp;was all because of that damned Murong Qi Qi! This bitch actually wanted to kill her today! If it wasn’t because Jia Lan reached out a helping hand, Murong Qi Qi would’ve definitely tortured her, bit by bit, till she died!</p>
 <p>Thinking back about Murong Qi Qi’s vicious tactics, Murong Qing Lian was full of hatred. She actually was defeated by Murong Qi Qi, that rubbish. When she goes back, she doesn’t know what kind of joke she would be in front of others. No! She must find Murong Qi Qi to recover this humiliation! Otherwise, she wouldn’t have the face to go back to Xi Qi!</p>
 <p>Although she hated Murong Qi Qi, but Murong Qing Lian also knew that if it wasn’t because Jia Lan had saved her, she would’ve definitely died on the platform. So, although her whole body was in pain, she limped over to Jia Lan. She cupped her fists and thanked Jia Lan.</p>
 <p>“No need to thank me. I only did it for someone else.”</p>
 <p>Jia Lan was too lazy to look at the woman in front of him. While touching his bandaged arm, he walked away with Jin Yu from Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, I still thank you!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian bowed heavily towards Jia Lan’s back.</p>
 <p>“Oh…”</p>
 <p>Jia Lan laughed and turned his head to look at the sincere Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“You were lucky! It’s only this one time! However, I still need to remind you, you are not someone who could afford to offend Murong Qi Qi. You also couldn’t win her at fighting. It’s better to do as she said. Live your life while behaving! This is my advice to you!”</p>
 <p>After leaving these words, Jia Lan left without turning back.</p>
 <p>Seeing Jia Lan treat her like this, Murong Qing Lian couldn’t help herself from making a ‘bah’ sound of contempt.</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Qing Lian had completely forgotten how she previously begged Jia Lan to save her. She'd also forgotten that Jia Lan got injured because of saving her. Her small self-esteem was deeply angered by that last sentence of Jia Lan. What did that person mean? How come he made it sound like he's someone on the same boat as Murong Qi Qi!</p>
 <p>“What kind of thing is he to dare to teach me?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian humphed once. The little bit of gratitude in her heart for Jia Lan was gone.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Inside the carriage, Murong Qi Qi was curled up in Feng Cang’s arms. She was quiet like a well-behaved cat, making Feng Cang somewhat unable to adapt to it.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s hand went through Murong Qi Qi’s smooth, black hair. His lips gently fell on Murong Qi Qi’s forehead.</p>
 <p>“Are you still thinking about Murong Qing Lian? How about I find someone to catch her back?”</p>
 <p>“No need.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi leaned lazily on Feng Cang’s shoulder. Her fingers played with the hair of Feng Cang which was hanging on his shoulder. However, her eyes flashed astuteness.</p>
 <p>“I was just thinking about who Jia Lan is. What relation does he have with Murong Qing Lian? <em>Wangye, </em>I’ve been feeling that the tests Dong Lu gave in this tournament were a bit odd. There’s certainly a mastermind who gave them his support. It's just, I don’t know if that mastermind is Jia Lan or not…”</p>
 <p>“Jia Lan is someone from Penglai Island.”</p>
