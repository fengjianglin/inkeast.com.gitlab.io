 <p>Chapter 57 The good play begins</p>
 <p>“No, no! <em>Wangye</em>[1. Wang/ wangye: prince of the first rank], you have to believe me!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the hatred in Longze Jing Tian’s eyes, Murong Xin Lian hastened to defend herself.</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Xin Lian’s outstretched hand to touch his sleeve, Longze Jing Tian waved and pushed her away.</p>
 <p>“Get away……don’t disgust <em>benwang</em>[2. Benwang: I, used by a wangye]!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye……”</em></p>
 <p>How can Murong Xin Lian accept that the man who just smiled gently at her is now looking at her full of disgust?</p>
 <p>No! This is all Murong Qi Qi’s trick. Murong Qi Qi hates her for entering Jing <em>wangfu</em>[3. Wangfu: residence of a wangye]. Now she wants to sabotage her and Longze Jing Tian! She can’t let Murong Qi Qi’s evilness succeed!</p>
 <p>Not being able to move Longze Jing Tian, Murong Xin Lian can only put all her anger on Murong Qi Qi’s accomplice…...Fei Cui.</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui, I treated you well. Why did you go along with Murong Qi Qi to frame me?”</p>
 <p>“Second miss, what are you saying? You did so many things against the conscience, can it be that you aren’t afraid of lightening or retribution?!”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui’s eyes were red and swollen. She cried very pitifully.</p>
 <p>“That day, you wanted to kill me. Eldest young master was also there. If princess doesn’t believe, you can ask eldest young master!”</p>
 <p>Originally Murong Tai didn’t believe in these. He firmly believed that it’s just Murong Qi Qi wanting to take Murong Xin Lian down. He wanted to help his second daughter, but Fei Cui mentioned his eldest son. He was a bit hesitant and couldn’t help but look at Murong Jun next to him.</p>
 <p>“What Fei Cui said is true.”</p>
 <p>Murong Jun stood up and told everything that happened that day.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian totally didn’t expect that Murong Jun who normally looked down at Murong Qi Qi the most, at this time will stood at Murong Qi Qi’s side and bite herself in the back. Why is it like that? Why does Murong Jun want to help that rubbish Murong Qi Qi?</p>
 <p>“Why are you all making trouble for me? Why are you slandering me? Murong Qi Qi what motive do you have? Why is even big brother being bribed by you and help you lie?”</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian still didn’t forget to attack her. Murong Qi Qi sighed: “Second big sister, we don’t have injustice or animosity between us. Why do you hate me so much?”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words brought back all the memories in Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>Why? Why! No matter what the reason is, she just hates Murong Qi Qi. Hate her for obviously being a rubbish, but because of her noble birth, she can get a good marriage. That’s why she hates everything about Murong Qi Qi!</p>
 <p>Now, her beautiful dream is about to come true, but before Murong Qi Qi left she made such a scene. Why does this Murong Qi Qi always ruin her matters? Can it be that the heavens send Murong Qi Qi to strain her?</p>
 <p>Seeing Longze Jing Tian’s frost like eyes, Murong Xin Lian’s last string of reasoning collapsed.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, I just despise you! I hate you! Aside from having a mother from a noble birth who gave you a noble identity, you are nothing. You are obviously a rubbish, but because of your noble blood, you can become Jing <em>wangfei</em>[4. Wangfei: main wife if a wangye]. What do you have to get that position? I let Fei Cui spread those rumors. I also told princess many bad things about you. All of these are done by me! I had a hard time, I’ll also let you have a hard time!”</p>
 <p>People were stunned by Murong Xin Lian’s hysteria.</p>
 <p>The truth came out. No matter how stupid Longze Yu Er is, she understood the whole story. If it wasn’t because Murong Xin Lian inciting, confusing the right and the wrong to let her believe those rumors about Murong Qi Qi, she wouldn’t have become such a big joke today!</p>
 <p>A country’s princess was being played by a woman from the illegitimate line. Being used and also lost face in front of the envoys of the three countries. Even more, she let Longze Yu lost the Tai Sui. Because of this she also became the laughing stock of the high society. All of these are things Longze Yu Er couldn’t accept.</p>
 <p>“Murong Xin Lian, <em>bengong</em>[5. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family] will kill you!”</p>
 <p>The just humiliated Longze Yu Er drew out a sword and rushed in Murong Xin Lian’s direction.</p>
 <p>The sword’s silver glance stimulated Murong Xin Lian’s nerves and also let her woke up. Heavens! What did she just say? How come she confessed? Why is it that when her eyes met Murong Qi Qi’s, her mind became blank?</p>
 <p>Having no time to think all of these through, Murong Xin Lian dodged the oncoming sword. Seeing Murong Xin Lian dodge, Longze Yu Er became angrier. She immediately pushed her inner energy. Her body was immediately surrounded by orange color.</p>
 <p>The other has the intention to kill. For self-protection, Murong Xin Lian was also forced to use her inner energy. She was immediately wrapped b a circle of yellow light.</p>
 <p>‘Ping, Ping!’</p>
 <p>Sword and whip clashed in the air. Two graceful figures were also intertwined in the air. The places where they touch were be ruined. Others screamed and dodged, afraid to being hurt by those two. For a time, the imperial garden was a chaos.</p>
 <p>“Rebel, rebel!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu’s beard shook in anger.</p>
 <p>“Stop them for z<em>hen</em>[6. Zhen: I, used by an emperor]! Quickly!</p>
 <p>Longze Yu’s words just fell, the two figures rushed towards the royal concubines. Then a scream was heard. Murong Xue Lian knelt on the ground, holding her belly. Under her legs was bright red.</p>
 <p>“Emp, emperor, save <em>chenqie’s</em>[7. Chenqie: used by the females of the imperial family towards someone of higher rank] child!”</p>
 <p>“Beloved consort!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu was also anxious. He hastily rushed to Murong Xue Lian and held her hand tightly.</p>
 <p>“Imperial physician! Get the imperial physician!”</p>
 <p>“Emperor……”</p>
 <p>Murong Xue Lian’s face was pale. Her slender left hand clutched her gown. Feeling the warm flow moving in the lower part of her body, Murong Xue Lian was in horror. This child is the root for her to settle down, ah! Nothing must happen!</p>
 <p>“Emperor, save our child! I beg you!”</p>
 <p>The beauty’s cry and the unstoppable bleeding, made Longze Yu’s expression became livid.</p>
 <p>“Darn! Tie them up for <em>zhen</em>!”</p>
 <p>Before people could separate Murong Xin Lian and Longze Yu Er, they heard a loud noise. Longze Yu Er felt straight to the ground. Her face color was purple. Around her neck was Murong Xin Lian’s whip.</p>
 <p>“Yu Er!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Qing stumbled to Longze Yu Er, but found out that she already passed away!</p>
 <p>“Yu Er!”</p>
 <p>‘Dong……’</p>
 <p>At the other side, Murong Xin Lian also knelt on the ground. Blood stained her lower part of the body, but the blood has already become black.</p>
 <p>“My child! My child!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian grabbed the dress on her belly.</p>
 <p>“My child!”</p>
 <p>For a time, the court was in chaos. All the imperial physicians rushed to the imperial garden. The other people stood at a distance. They didn’t even dare to breath loudly, because Longze Yu’s expression is already very very bad.</p>
 <p>“Emperor, pardon us. The prince couldn’t be kept……”</p>
 <p>“Emperor, pardon us, princess is gone……</p>
 <p>“Emperor, pardon us. <em>Ce wangfei</em> [8. Cefei/ ce wangfei: second ranked wife of a wangye] had a miscarriage……”</p>
 <p>One after another bad news hit Longze Yu. When she heard that the unborn child couldn’t be kept, Murong Xue Lian exclaimed and then fainted. The imperial physician immediately rushed forward and let her swallow ginseng tablets. After a long time, Murong Xue Lian slowly woke up.</p>
 <p>“Beloved consort……”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu was very sad for losing the child. He really looked forward for this child to come into this world. He hadn’t thought that the child will be lost.</p>
 <p>“Emperor!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xue Lian heartbrokenly leaned against Longze Yu’s embrace.</p>
 <p>“Emperor, you must definitely take revenge for our child! Definitely take revenge for our child, ah!”</p>
