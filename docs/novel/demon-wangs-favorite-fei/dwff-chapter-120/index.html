 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 120 The truth is so cruel (4)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“She? How would she die?! The one who died was her maidservant Cai Hua! She (CH) was the scapegoat! Ming Yue had great fortune and big blessing, how would she die?!” When Li Qiu Shui spoke, her gaze fell on Wanyan Lie, making Wanyan Lie startled. This woman is a madman. Could she want to pour out everything that happened in the past? No! Can’t let her say!</p>
 <p>“Ming Yue didn’t die? Where is she?” The moment Dongfang Lan heard that, she stood up. Her daughter didn’t die? Ming Yue didn’t die!</p>
 <p>“Why do I need to tell you?! Since I’m unhappy, I’ll let all of you be unhappy! Besides, which one of your ears heard me say that she is still alive? I only said that after Ming Yue gave birth to her, she didn’t die. How would I know what happened after that?”</p>
 <p>“What did you do to my Ming Yue?” Dongfang was clearly able to see the hate in Li Qiu Shui’s eyes. She immediately determined that everything was done by Li Qiu Shui, including the battle fifteen years ago at Yandang Mountain. Maybe, Li Qiu Shui had credit in it. “Talk!” Wanyan Lie also berated at a side.</p>
 <p>Although Dongfang Lan was very imposing, but Li Qiu Shui wasn’t afraid.</p>
 <p>She came here today and didn’t expect to go out alive from here. Originally, she thought to come look at the joke of Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang. How would she know that the matter didn’t happen according to how she planned? She planned for so long, but everything was for nothing. This let all the grief and indignation in Li Qiu Shui’s heart be released.</p>
 <p>“Humph, what right do you have to command me?” Li Qiu Shui pointed at Dongfang Lan. Then she turned to Wanyan Lie, “And you, you even more don’t have the right to command me!”</p>
 <p>Li Qiu Shui laughed while her eyes were fixed on Wanyan Lie. Her expression was mysterious, “What are you?! Do you think your nauseous face could be hidden from them for a whole life? You let me talk? What do you want me to talk about? Talk about how I calculated Feng Xie or talk about the past relationship between me and you or talk about that you like your own biological…”</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous!” Not waiting for Li Qiu Shui to finish, in her lower abdomen was a four-inch sword. It went from her abdomen directly into her back.</p>
 <p>“Pooh,” A mouthful blood of Li Qiu Shui sprayed on Wanyan Lie’s face. Now, he wanted to silence her? He wanted to kill her to block her mouth? He wanted to cover the thing that happened that year? He wanted to hide his true self?</p>
 <p>“You want to silence…” Wanyan Lie’s hand put more force. The sword completely buried into Li Qiu Shui’s stomach. ‘Shua…’ Wanyan Lie fiercely pulled out the sword stained with blood. Blood burst out form the wound.</p>
 <p>“Shui <em>er</em>[1. Er: term of endearment]!” Murong Tai couldn’t stop Wanyan Lie. He could only catch Li Qiu Shui, “Shui <em>er</em>, Shui <em>er</em>, how are you feeling?”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Tai’s anxious expression, Li Qiu Shui wanted to laugh. The blood poured from her mouth were like a stream, unable to stop. In a moment, it stained the place on her chest. “Didn’t…didn’t expect…in the end…I…died…in…your embrace…”</p>
 <p>“Shui <em>er</em>, don’t talk. I’ll take you to a doctor. Don’t talk!” Murong Tai wanted to use his hand to block the blood from coming out of Li Qiu Shiu’s wound. However, the blood were like river and poured out through his fingers. It made Murong Tai’s hand red.</p>
 <p>“It…it’s useless…” After every word Li Qiu Shui said, at the corner of her lips a red blood flower would bloom. On her forehead were big drops of cold sweat. Her body also couldn’t help but shiver. Looking at Murong Qi Qi, Li Qiu Shui’s lips trembled slightly.</p>
 <p>“I…am going to…see your father…or…I didn’t win from your mother…after I died…I will still fight with her…”</p>
 <p>After finishing, Li Qiu Shui’s head slightly turned. With a magnificent smile, she left the world.</p>
 <p>“Shui <em>er</em>! Shui <em>er</em>! Ah…” Murong Tai screamed sorrowfully like an injured wolf. His screams echoed on throughout the harem. “Shui e<em>r</em>, Shui <em>er</em>, don’t leave me! You’re right. There was nothing between us, but I’m willing to be your small dog and follow every day at your feet. It’s fine if you hit me and scold me. Shui <em>er</em>! I beg you, wake up! Don’t leave me!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Tai like this, Longze Jing Tian was about to go to him and comfort him. However, he didn’t expect Murong Tai to take the sword from Wanyan Lie’s hand and stab it in his own belly.</p>
 <p>“Prime minister!” Longze Jing Tian was startled and went forward to support Murong Tai. Unexpectedly, Murong Tai broke free from his hand and tightly hugged Li Qiu Shui, “You want to rest and fly together with Feng Xie…I don’t allow it…even in death…I’ll wind around you…”</p>
 <p>“Prime minister...,” Longze Jing Tian had never seen such a hysterical love, “Why, is it worth it?!”</p>
 <p>“Jing <em>wang</em>[2. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank]...I beg you, burry me and Shui <em>er</em> together…I beg you…” Blood poured out of Murong Tai’s nose and mouth. He struggled to keep one breath and tightly pulled Longze Jing Tian’s sleeve, “I beg you…must burry together…”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian couldn’t understand the kind of love like that of Murong Tai and Li Qiu Shui. However, to a dead man’s request, he still nodded and accepted, “Prime minister, don’t worry, I’ll let you be buried together forever!”</p>
 <p>With Longze Jing Tian’s promise, Murong Tai revealed a smile of happiness. His hands were slightly trembling. He pushed aside the hair on Li Qiu Shui’s forehead, “Shui…Shui <em>er</em>...we will never…be separated…”</p>
 <p>“Daddy! Daddy!” Murong Qing Lian who had been scared out of her wits, now finally realized that her only supporter was about to leave. She quickly crawled to Murong Tai, “Daddy, don’t go! Don’t go!”</p>
 <p>“Eheh…,” At this point, Murong Tai was unable to speak. He only smiled and looked once at Murong Qing Lian. There was no regret in his eyes. His eyes were filled with happiness, filling every corner of his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai and Li Qiu Shui’s death made the atmosphere become heavier. They didn’t expect that in this world there was such extreme love. Really don’t know how to describe them. Presumably, the love they weren’t able to get it was the most perfect in their heart!</p>
 <p>The only one person who kept a clear mind and was cheering at Li Qiu Shui’s death was Wanyan Lie. Li Qiu Shui died. The person who knew his secret died. In the future, he could still play the role of a good uncle and could pamper Murong Qi Qi like how he pampered Ming Yue. How beautiful, ah!</p>
 <p>In Wanyan Lie’s eyes, the future was bright, the road was smooth. Regaining Murong Qi Qi was his happiest matter! He fantasied countless of times that he could have one princess so well-behaved like Wanyan Ming Yue. However, it seemed that the consorts’ belly didn’t live up to his expectations. His only daughter was Wanyan Bao Zhu, but she couldn’t even compare to a half Ming Yue.</p>
 <p>Now, Wanyan Ming Yue’s biological daughter stood very alive in front of him. How could Wanyan Lie not be happy?!</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi…,” Wanyan Lie tried out calling Murong Qi Qi once. When she turned her head, Wanyan Lie’s heart was jumping badly. Alike, so alike! The side of her face was exactly like Ming Yue’s! Wanyan Lie almost cried from joy.</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, now you know your identity, do you want to acknowledge your roots and ancestors?” Wanyan Lie carefully asked Murong Qi Qi’s opinion. He wanted to know her thoughts. It was no means to force her. This is Ming Yue’s daughter, ah! His niece, ah! And she’s about to become the noblest princess of Bei Zhou!</p>
 <p>Acknowledge her roots and ancestors…Hearing this, Murong Qi Qi looked at Feng Cang. The truth was so cruel. She&nbsp;really is Feng Cang’s little sister! Once her lover, now became her biological big brother. Murong Qi Qi somewhat couldn’t accept this, but she had no way not to admit to this fact.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s painful expression made Feng Cang’s heart feel like it was pierced. His little <em>wangfei</em>[3. Wangfei: main consort/wife of the prince of first rank] is now so sad like a melancholic lark. She lost her vitality. Obviously, there were tears in her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing!” Feng Cang couldn’t take it anymore and took Murong Qi Qi in his arms, “Qing Qing, if you want to cry, then cry!”</p>
 <p>“Woo woo…” Feng Cang’s words were like a key and opened the closed gate of Murong Qi Qi’s heart. Her tears rushed down. Murong Qi Qi nestled in Feng Cang’s arms and cried like there was no one around.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s crying also made Longze Jing Tian’s heart hurt. If such a thing didn’t happen, then she would be a perfect couple with Feng Cang and would be so in love that it would make others jealous. However, in a blink of eye, lovers became siblings. How could Murong Qi Qi accept that?</p>
 <p>Although Longze Jing Tian also wanted Murong Qi Qi, but seeing her so sad, his heart also felt painful. If he could, he was willing to unwrinkled Murong Qi Qi’s frowning brows, wipe her moist eyes, warm her wounded heart and carefully care for her during her every mood.</p>
 <p>Have to say, a beauty crying was a beautiful picture. Looking at Murong Qi Qi sobbing beautifully in Feng Cang’s arms, Wanyan Hong’s heart almost jumped out. He had seen many beauties, but have never seen one like Murong Qi Qi; beautiful to pureness, beautiful to cleanness woman….</p>
 <p>Such a beautiful woman should have been made for him. No matter what, he needed to get Murong Qi Qi! Even if it was using dirty handed means, he needed to be unscrupulous!</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, don’t cry! It’s uncle who was bad. If you’re sad, then hit uncle!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie was completely at his wit’s end at Murong Qi Qi’s crying. It was like in the past, every time Wanyan Ming Yue cried, his heart would hurt very much. Now, seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, he was also sad, “If you don’t want, uncle won’t force, alright?”</p>
 <p>After hearing Wanyan Lie’s words, Murong Qi Qi raised her head. A pair of teary eyes looked at Wanyan Lie. Wanyan Lie couldn’t understand the emotions inside those eyes.</p>
 <p>“I want to go home!”</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, alright! Go home! Go home!” Wanyan Lie quickly accepted Murong Qi Qi’s only request. He immediately let people prepare the carriage to bring Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang back to Nan Lin <em>wangfu</em>.</p>
 <p>Originally, Dongfang Lan wanted to have a talk with her granddaughter, but seeing Murong Qi Qi crying so sadly, Dongfang Lan also held back. This child, ah! She must be sad! Her relation with Feng Cang was so good.&nbsp; no one thought it would become like this! Let her go home! When her mood is better, she would let her come into the palace.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi without any scruples till they entered the carriage.</p>
 <p>The carriage slowly left the palace. Murong Qi Qi didn’t say anything. Her eyes were red like a small rabbit’s. seeing her like this, Feng Cang’s heart ached a lot. “Qing Qing…”</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>now, do I need to call you big brother?” A ‘big brother’ let the tears of Murong Qi Qi fell again. What an ironic appellation! If there wasn’t the accident of Li Qiu Shui, she would call him husband. Now husband became big brother. How could Murong Qi Qi’s heart feel great about this?</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing!” Feng Cang lowered his head and kissed the tears at the corners of Murong Qi Qi’s eyes, “Don’t cry. Qing Qing, if you cry, my world would be raining!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s gentleness made Murong Qi Qi sadder. What about now? What could they do now? Even if Feng Cang was the under one person and above ten thousand people Nan Lin <em>wang</em>, but it still couldn’t change the fact that she’s his little sister. Murong Qi Qi could now only cut off these feelings and burry it forever in her heart.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi just left, Longze Jing Tian stood out, “Your respected majesty, I as Xi Qi’s Jing <em>wang</em> want to ask for a marriage! I want to marry your niece, Feng Cang’s little sister!”</p>
 <p>Although it had been identified that Murong Qi Qi is Feng family’s daughter, but he didn’t know how to address her. So, Longze Jing Tian could only use ‘Feng Cang’s little sister’ to address Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>The moment he heard Longze Jing Tian took action so quickly, Wanyan Hong also didn’t want to be outdone, “Emperor father, this subject son fell in love with cousin at the first sight. Asking emperor father to decree marriage!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian who was just crying for Murong Tai, after seeing these two men ask for Murong Qi Qi’s hand at the same time, sorrow entered her heart.</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian is the man she loves, but his mind only thought about Murong Qi Qi. She knew this. However, now Murong Qi Qi became a free woman, making him have a chance. How could Murong Qing Lian not feel sad?</p>
 <p>As for Wanyan Hong, just now he was saying he wanted to marry her as his c<em>efei</em>[4. Cefei: side consort/second ranked wife of the prince of first rank], his <em>soul and spirit</em> had been <em>turned upside</em> down by Murong Qi Qi. He immediately changed his attitude and wanted to marry Murong Qi Qi. What kind of world was this?!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Soul and spirit turned upside down: head over heels </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>At this time, in Murong Qing Lian’s heart, Murong Qi Qi was a wreck. Before, when she saw Murong Qi Qi’s appearance, Murong Qing Lian was stunned. She didn’t expect that Murong Qi Qi would have such masterpiece of a face. She was completely defeated.</p>
 <p>Plus, the fact that the two man who are connected to her were asking for Murong Qi Qi’s hand, Murong Qing Lian’s hate for Murong Qi Qi became stronger. Not to mention that Murong Tai died indirectly at Murong Qi Qi’s hands. She couldn’t not avenge this!</p>
 <p>The two asked to marry Murong Qi Qi at the same time. Wanyan Lie’s expression immediately turned bad. How could he not know what these two were thinking? They actually saw Murong Qi Qi as the tool for the power struggle. Wanyan Lie couldn’t tolerate this and would also not allow it!</p>
 <p>“Too many things happened today. <em>Zhen</em>[5. Zhen: I used by the emperor] think it’s better to wait till Qi Qi restored her mood. No hurry, don’t worry!”</p>
 <p>A ‘don’t worry’ dispatched Longze Jing Tian and Wanyan Hong and also let consort De, Lin Ke Xin be relieved. Exactly! Now, Murong Qi Qi is a golden cake. Everyone wants her! However, only her Yi <em>er</em> is worthy of Murong Qi Qi!</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan got headache because of this series of occurrence. She let Qing Gu support her back to Jinxuan palace. Longze Jing Tian saw that Wanyan Lie didn’t accept his proposal. He also understood his (WL) current thoughts. He asked to take Murong Tai’s and Li Qiu Shui’s body away.</p>
 <p>Although Wanyan Lie truly wanted to throw Li Qiu Shui’s body outside the suburbs to feed dogs, but since Longze Jing Tian asked, he couldn’t let him (LJT) lost face. Besides, they were only corpses. Why be angry at a corpse?! So, he nodded and agreed.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>When Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi returned to Nan Lin <em>wangfu</em>[6. Wangfu: the residence of the prince of first rank], Wanyan Lie’s imperial edict had already been decreed; bestowing Murong Qi Qi the title of princess Zhen Guo. When this news reached the w<em>angfu, </em>the whole <em>wangfu</em> exploded.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Princess Zhen Guo means Guarding Country princess and is the highest rank of princesses e.g. princess of first rank. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Why was it like this? Why did <em>wangfei</em> become princess Zhen Guo?” Just as everyone was surprised, Feng Cang came down the carriage while holding Murong Qi Qi. When Feng Qi saw Murong Qi Qi’s appearance, his mouth was wide open, “Princess…”</p>
 <p>This ‘princess’ from Feng Qi let everyone’s gaze fell on Murong Qi Qi’s face. These were the old people of <em>wangfu</em>. They served Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Now, seeing a girl with the same appearance as Wanyan Ming Yue, everyone was stunned with their mouth wide open.</p>
 <p>Only Feng Yu recognized the official robe Murong Qi Qi was wearing. It was the one <em>wangfei</em> wore this morning. It was just, why did Murong Qi Qi’s face change to the same one as Wanyan Ming Yue. This made Feng Yu very surprised, “<em>Wangfei</em>, you…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t want to speak. She only buried her head in Feng Cang’s arms. Seeing her so sad, Feng Cang spoke for her, “It has been verified. Murong Qi Qi is <em>benwang</em>’s[6. Benwang: this king, I used by the prince of first rank] biological little sister. She is that daughter of father and mother!”</p>
 <p>“What?!” The news that came out of Feng Cang’s mouth was truly too horrifying and too scaring. Now, everyone understood why the emperor bestowed Murong Qi Qi the title of princess Zhen Guo.</p>
 <p>“Miss…” Su Mei and Su Yue were shocked. They stood there foolishly. They were shocked that Murong Qi Qi revealed her true appearance and her real identity was actually Feng Cang’s little sister. This scared the wits out of the two. How could it be like this? Miss and <em>guye</em>[7. Guye: son-in-law/ also used by the servants of the mistress] were so much in love. How come they entered the palace and returned as siblings?</p>
 <p>“Then, then yesterday…” Even Feng Qi who experienced big winds and waves stuttered. One moment, she was <em>wangfei</em>, the next moment she became a princess, is, is the relationship then not messed up? Besides, yesterday <em>wangye</em> and <em>wangfei</em> consummated the marriage, then wouldn’t it be…Feng Qi didn’t want to think about the consequences of this.</p>
 <p>“We’re fine.” One sentence summed up the matter of last night. Feng Cang hugged Murong Qi Qi and walked into Tingsong building. The whole way to the w<em>angfu</em>, Murong Qi Qi had been silent. She didn’t even say one word. She didn’t know what to say and didn’t know how to get along with Feng Cang in the future. Before, she was thinking how to keep it a secret. She didn’t expect that today Li Qiu Shui would expose all the truth. So, her thoughts of before, were just her deceiving herself. There was only one truth, but it was so cruel, making her so in pain as not to want to live anymore.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, Feng Cang was also very sad. He poured water and brought it to Murong Qi Qi’s mouth, “Qing Qing, drink some! If you continue to cry like this, my last line of defense&nbsp; would collapse!</p>
 <p>“Big brother, in the future, you can’t call me Qing Qing. You need to call me little sister…”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Murong Qi Qi’s tears fell once again. The small face which was originally as big as a palm looked more and more pitiful.</p>
 <p>“No! It’s not like this!” Feng Cang couldn’t take it anymore and pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace, “Qing Qing, it’s not like this! You’re not my little sister. I’m also not your big brother. We aren’t siblings. We aren’t siblings!”</p>
 <p>“Big brother…don’t deceive yourself…” Hearing Feng Cang say that, Murong Qi Qi was sadder. “Big brother, we can never be in love…”</p>
 <p>“No…”</p>
