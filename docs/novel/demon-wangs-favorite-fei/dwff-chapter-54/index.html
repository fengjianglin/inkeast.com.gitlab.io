 <p>Chapter 54 Shou Gong Sha</p>
 <p>“Imperial big brother, you roar at me?”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er looked at Longze Jing Tian with eyes full of disbelief. Although they didn’t come from the same mother, but towards this little sister, normally Longze Jing Tian still spoil and love her. He has never been so stern with her. At this time, seeing a complete strange Longze Jing Tian, Longze Yu Er totally couldn’t accept it.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, <em>benwang’s</em>[1. Benwang:I, used by a wangye] imperial little sister talked irresponsibly. Asking Nan Lin w<em>ang</em>[2. Wang: prince of the first rank] and princess Zhao Yang for forgiveness!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian turned around and apologized to Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi. He was hoping from the bottom of his heart that Feng Cang didn’t hear those ‘darn words’ of Longze Yu Er. If Feng Cang believed those words and doesn’t recognize this marriage, then Murong Qi Qi’s reputation will be so bad that she will become the joke of everyone for the rest of her life!</p>
 <p>Now, Longze Jing Tian felt very remorseful. If he didn’t break off the engagement, Murong Qi Qi wouldn’t have to marry faraway and also won’t cause her so much trouble because of the broken engagement. Thinking till here, the way Longze Jing Tian looked at Murong Qi Qi turned more remorseful.</p>
 <p>“Ha……,” Feng Cang chuckled loudly. He reveled a beautiful smile. “Since princess said there was, <em>benwang</em> thinks is better to investigate lest to let another slander <em>benwang’s wangfei</em>[3. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye] again in the future. Today, taking this opportunity to let everything become clear!”</p>
 <p>With Feng Cang’s words, Longze Yu Er’s spine also straightened. After all, what man doesn’t care about that kind of thing? Losing chastity before marriage, this is a big scandal, ah! No one will be so stupid to want a second hand good! Longze Yu Er began to admire her own cleverness.</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui is already dead. The dead can’t testify. That matter can’t be let go. As for is she is or isn’t a broken shoe, just take a look at the <em>Shou Gong Sha </em>and we will know!”</p>
 <p>[caption id="attachment_8219" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-8219" src="http://volarenovels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-16061GG145112-300x158.jpg" alt="Shou Gong Sha" width="300" height="158"> Shou Gong Sha[/caption]</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Shou Gong Sha: gecko cinnabar/ protector of the palace. In ancient China &nbsp;there should be blood on the bed when a woman has intercourse for the first time. Another way to check if they were a virgin was with the gecko cinnabar. The gecko cinnabar is a red colored powder made of dried gecko fed on cinnabar. It is said to leave a red mark on a woman’s body, most of the time the upper arm. Supposedly, the mark will fade away once the woman had intercourse. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Check the Shou Gong Sha? This is not a bad idea! Murong Qi Qi revealed a cold smile. Having watched Longze Yu Er performing alone for so long, she this involved part also needed to appear.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, what are you laughing at?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the smile on Murong Qi Qi’s face, Longze Yu Er froze for a moment. Then she taunted: “Now you still have the face to smile? Wait a while and you won’t even be able to cry!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Longze Yu Er like that, the hand Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi’s hands was somewhat chilly. His voice also turned cold: “Longze Yu Er, don’t go too far!”</p>
 <p>Standing beside Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi clearly felt the chill on this man’s body. If it wasn’t because he was still talking in soft and gentle words to her, Murong Qi Qi would’ve thought the person next to her was changed.</p>
 <p>“I believe you.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang squeezed Murong Qi Qi’s soft hand.</p>
 <p>“No matter how you are, you are still the <em>wangfei benwang </em>wants!”</p>
 <p>The meaning of Feng Cang’s words were very clear. No matter what Murong Qi Qi chose, he will protect her and he also doesn’t need for Murong Qi Qi to use such way to prove herself, because he believes her.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s protectiveness let Murong Qi Qi be very moved.</p>
 <p>To a woman, verifying the Shou Gong Sha is a very humiliating thing. But her reputation being publicly insulted, if she didn’t prove it then it’ll be like a scar on her body and she will be bearing an ugly reputation for the rest of her life. For her whole life, she wouldn’t be able to raise her head again.</p>
 <p>After all, here isn’t the twenty first century. This is a traditional society. Since she came here, she must follow the rules of this world and she can’t let people slander her!</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>I’m fine since princess Ping Yang questions <em>bengong’s</em>[4. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family] innocence, <em>bengong </em>is willing to be investigated. But if <em>bengong </em>is <em>clean as ice and clear as jade</em>, then all of these will be princess Ping Yang slandering and vilifying me. Then how should we punish princess’s slander?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Clean as ice and clear as jade: spotless</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“If what <em>bengong </em>said is false, <em>bengong </em>is willing to accept any punishment.”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er wasn’t afraid. Murong Xin Lian told her all of these. She doesn’t have a reason to lie to her.</p>
 <p>“Good! If it’s slander, <em>bengong</em> wants the head on princess’s body as the price for humiliating <em>bengong </em>today!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi said those words <em>chopping the nail and slicing the iron</em>, making Longze Yu Er flustered. But thinking about those rumors and everything Murong Xin Lian told her, Longze Yu Er got her strength back. Besides she is Xi Qi country’s princess, Murong Qi Qi is just an official’s daughter. Wanting her head, can it be that Murong Qi Qi wants to offend her superior?</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Chopping the nail and slicing the iron: resolute and decisive</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“No problem! But if you are not a virgin, <em>bengong w</em>ants you to die!”</p>
 <p>The things happened too suddenly, so sudden Duanmu Qing hadn’t had the time to stop her daughter. That day she was present. There wasn’t Lian <em>gongzi</em>[5. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer to a famous man] and there wasn’t the so called affair. All of these are rumors. She didn’t think that her foolish daughter will believe them!</p>
 <p>Since the bet has already been put, what can she do now? What can she do? Should she let the old maid who will do the examination commit fraud?</p>
 <p>Duanmu Qing’s anxiousness went into Murong Xue Lian’s eyes. Just thinking once, she understood the situation. Such a good chance to hit the empress, how can Murong Xue Lian let it pass?!”</p>
 <p>“Emperor, princess Zhao Yang is the future Nan Lin <em>wangfei.</em> Her body is precious. How can servants touch her body? Besides, girls have thin face. If you let her be examined in the crowd, how will she be able to face people in the future?”</p>
 <p>Murong Xue Lian had some fatigue. Her body slightly tilted and nestled in Longze Yu’s arms.</p>
 <p>Murong Xue Lian’s words went into Longze Yu’s heart. Longze Yu Er really has a pig’s brain. No matter if Murong Qi Qi is or isn’t a virgin, in the end Feng Cang will get angry. The one who will suffer damage is still Xi Qi! Longze Yu really wanted to strangle this daughter!</p>
 <p>“Beloved consort, what do you think we should do?”</p>
 <p>Fragrant jade in his arms, Longze Yu’s mood became slightly better. It’s still this little woman in his arms who is the most understanding and understands his heart.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t we look for a few misses from the great families with the same status. Everyone is the same age and wouldn’t have that awkwardness.”</p>
 <p>Murong Xue Lian proposal made Longze Yu couldn’t help but clap. Then he asked Murong Qi Qi’s opinion. Murong Qi Qi has nothing to say. No matter what, today’s shame, she must get it back!</p>
 <p>Misses from the great families with same status, there are only two……Bai Yi Yue and Duanmu Yi Yi. They have been called forward. Then the palace maids pulled down a two-meter-high white cloth. In the middle of the imperial garden, the cloth held up like a barrier box. The three entered.</p>
 <p>It’s the first time that Duanmu Yi Yi encountered such a thing. She was a little nervous. After all, the empress is her paternal aunt. Longze Yu Er is her cousin. Their relation is not so general.</p>
 <p>Seeing the situation Duanmu Yi Yi is in, Murong Qi Qi was calm and generous. She took off her outer layer of the gown and exposed a snow white arm. A bright red as blood and been sized Shou Gong Sha lay quietly on that piece of whiteness. The truth is exposed.</p>
 <p>“Princess has suffered!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yi Yue saw the Shou Gong Sha and nodded at Murong Qi Qi. She personally helped her put the dress back on.</p>
 <p>“Hoping that the two of you will give <em>bengong’s </em>innocent back!”</p>
 <p>After being dressed, Murong Qi Qi went out of the barrier.</p>
 <p>What should she do? What should she do?! Duanmu Yi Yi was very hesitant. What should she do if she said the truth and Murong Qi Qi really kills Longze Yu Er?&nbsp; Then if empress aunt wants to find who is accountable for, she will definitely come calculate with her!</p>
 <p>But to let her slander Muong Qi Qi, not mentioning that there’s still a Bai Yi Yue as witness, she can’t even pass her own conscience. Duanmu Yi Yi knows very well how important reputation is to a woman!</p>
 <p>As Duanmu Yi Yi was still being hesitant, Bai Yi Yue said some words which made her decide completely.</p>
