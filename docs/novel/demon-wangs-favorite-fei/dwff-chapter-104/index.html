 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 104 Don’t want to answer, then I’ll kiss you (2)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s answer was somewhat surprising to Murong Qi Qi, but after thinking about it, it sounded&nbsp;reasonable. It’s just, didn’t Penglai Island always not intervene in the matters of the mainland? Why did they help Dong Lu this time?</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi go&nbsp;into the stage of thinking, Feng Cang couldn’t help himself from kissing her forehead again.</p>
 <p>“Alright! Qing Qing, don’t think about this anymore. I already let someone go investigate! You worked so hard today; you need to rest well and relax. There’s a hot spring here. Do you want to go take a bath in the hot spring?”</p>
 <p>“Hot spring?”</p>
 <p>The Murong Qi Qi who was tangled up in the matters of Jia Lan, immediately sat up after hearing about a hot spring. From her eyes, flashed a light as dazzling as the sun.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye,</em>[1. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank] there’s really a hot spring? Where? Why didn’t you tell me sooner?! I like hot springs the most!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi liked it, Feng Cang was also happy. Especially after&nbsp;seeing her joyful&nbsp;like a small deer, he felt happy from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>“I’ll take you tonight! The condition is that you obediently eat well!”</p>
 <p>The hot spring Feng Cang talked about was located at the Fengyu villa outside of Yongzhou City. This was part of Feng Cang’s territory and also his holiday villa.&nbsp; When they arrived at Fengyu villa, Murong Qi Qi became&nbsp;mesmerized by the beautiful scenery in front of her.</p>
 <p>From the distance, it looked like a red cloud. After getting closer, she found out that it’s a garden full of red plum blossms.</p>
 <p>“My mother loved red plum blossoms. So, father planted this place&nbsp;full of red plums. Every winter, father would bring mother here to relax and take a bath in the hot spring. Only when&nbsp;it’s nearly the thirtieth of December, under the repeated urgings of grandmother and uncle, would they return back to the capital.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang walked hand in hand with Murong Qi Qi in the red plum garden.</p>
 <p>Hearing Feng Cang talk about the story of his parents, Murong Qi Qi could only imagine how in love great general Feng Xie and princess Ming Yue were. It was said that princess Ming Yue was known to be the world’s number one beauty. Feng Xie also had the title of the world's number one handsome man. They were the ideal couple and attracted the envy of others.</p>
 <p>Feng Xie and Wanyan Lie were friends who'd played together since young. Their relationship were closer than real brothers. Wanyan Ming Yue and Feng Xie were also childhood sweethearts. The two had been&nbsp;engaged since they were very young. Wanyan Ming Yue was just over sixteen when she married Feng Xie. A year after becoming his bride, she gave birth to Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>Don’t know if it was the scene that recalled memories or because at his side was the woman he loves, but something had evoked Feng Cang’s memories of his parents. Today, Feng Cang said a lot of things about Feng Xie and princess Ming Yue. Murong Qi Qi didn’t say a word and only listened quietly to Feng Cang’s memories of the past.</p>
 <p>“After father and mother passed away, I didn’t want to come here again. I was afraid that after seeing this garden full of red plum blossoms, I would think back about the happy past. So, I let people seal off the villa. Only now, when I planned to bring you here, did I let people clean it up.”</p>
 <p>Now, Murong Qi Qi understood why Feng Cang didn’t bring her before. This Fengyu villa had been sealed by Feng Cang for sixteen years. This was the first time it had welcomed its owner after so long.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>I will stay with you!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi buried her head in Feng Cang’s chest. Her arms were tightly around Feng Cang’s narrow waist.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>I will stay with you in the place of great general and princess for this whole lifetime!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s ‘promise’ let Feng Cang’s eyes get a bit wet. His big hand tapped Murong Qi Qi’s nose.</p>
 <p>“It wouldn’t take long any&nbsp;longer before you also call them father and mother. Qing Qing, come with me. I’ll take you to a place.”</p>
 <p>The place Feng Cang mentioned&nbsp;was a solitary grave site at the back of Fengyu villa.</p>
 <p>“My father’s bones are still here, but my mother had been burned into ashes. Although uncle wanted to bury my parents together in the imperial tomb, but I insisted on burying them here. This was the place father and mother liked the most. Inside are my father’s bones and my mother’s dress. It’s just, in here should be three people. My unborn little sister should also be here. At that time, she was only seven months and still in my mother’s belly. She was burned to ashes together with mother.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was a bit surprised and also happy that Feng Cang brought her to visit the great general and princess Ming Yue. Could this be considered him taking her to meet his parents?</p>
 <p>Feng Xie’s and Wanyan Ming Yue’s grave had clearly been cleaned. There were a variety of fruits, barbecue and pork legs. In front of the cemetery were three yellow incense sticks. The smoke followed the wind. Around the entire grave was a layer of a light smell.</p>
 <p>“Father, mother, this is my wife and also your future daughter-in-law.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi tightly while introducing his beloved woman to Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue.</p>
 <p>“Her name is Murong Qi Qi. She is the woman I found after searching for a long time. I love her. From the first time I set eyes on her, I fell in love with her. I love everything about her more than I love myself. Today, I specifically brought her here to see father and mother. I believe you will also like her!”</p>
 <p>“This year, I’ll stay at Fengyu villa to spend the new year with you. When we go back to the capital, we’ll hold the wedding. In my whole life, I would&nbsp;only have her as wife. I would love, protect and pamper her like how father loved mother! We will definitely lead a happy life, have children, grow old together and never leave or betray each other!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi got tears because of Feng Cang’s words. He really took her here to ‘see his parents’. This man’s mind is so delicate; how could she not love him?!</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi quietly leaned against Feng Cang and looked at the vigorous characters on the tombstone. In her heart, she quietly made a promise: “General, princess, I would love <em>wangye</em> in your stead. Rest in&nbsp;peace.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Fengyu villa’s open hot spring emitted hot air. The temperature was moderate. In this winter night, it gave infinite warmth. Although this&nbsp;was an open hot spring, but it had been divided into two parts; one for men, one for women.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi, Su Mei and Su Yue were at one side. Feng Cang, Wanyan Kang and Jin Mo were at the other side.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang put his ear against the wall and listened to the sounds from the other side. However, Jin Mo pulled him back with his other ear.</p>
 <p>“Hey, hey, Jin Mo, what are you doing?!”</p>
 <p>“Fifth highness, can you act&nbsp;like a gentleman?”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo scoffed a bit after seeing&nbsp;Wanyan Kang’s behavior. No matter what, listening against the wall like a woman, would be looked down on.</p>
 <p>Seeing Jin Mo so serious, Wanyan Kang also scoffed.</p>
 <p>“I don’t believe that cousin brother doesn’t have any other thoughts, right, cousin brother?! Don’t you want to go to the other side to take a look at cousin-in-law, ah?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang didn’t speak. His black hair was let loose in the&nbsp;water like black seaweed, making volts in the water. That exceptionally, devilishly beautiful face was even more mesmerizing in the hazy mist.</p>
 <p>“Alright! You remained silent, I will take it as if you agreed. Jin Mo, don’t be so serious. You haven’t meet a woman you love yet. If you meet one, you would be more tempted than me.”</p>
 <p>Towards Wanyan Kang’s words, Jin Mo once again snorted disdainfully. In the end, he closed his eyes and ignored Wanyan Kang. He didn’t want a woman! What he pursuits is the highest medical skills! How could he be the same as these commoners?!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>At the women’s side, Su Mei and Su Yue left after soaking for a while, leaving Murong Qi Qi to lean quietly at the shore. The mist and water of the hot spring covered her neck and hid all the other parts.</p>
 <p>So comfortable! Since no one was&nbsp;here, Murong Qi Qi took off the Water Moon Mirror. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the warm&nbsp;water temperature. It seemed as though it had been a long time since she was comfortable like this.</p>
 <p>This time, the fact that Bei Zhou had gotten first place at the tournament of the four countries made her finally relieved. She hoped that when she returns to the capital, the empress dowager wouldn’t continue to make trouble for her. She'd already achieved the request Dongfang Lan made…</p>
 <p>As Murong Qi Qi was relaxing with closed eyes, suddenly she heard some footsteps. Murong Qi Qi opened her eyes. She silently pulled the robe from the hanger at the shore and wore it. Just when she wrapped herself in it, a person in black appeared in front of her.</p>
 <p>This man had a doll mask on. A pink and white doll mask. The red mouth smiled very sweetly. At both cheeks of the doll were a touch of blush. Where the eyes should be, were two black holes. A pair of astute eyes were inside it.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? Why are you dressed like that and deceiving people?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi looked at the other party. Two silver threads appeared in her hand.</p>
 <p>The person in black looked somewhat surprised after intruding the hot spring. When he saw that face of Murong Qi Qi, he stood there, unable to move.</p>
 <p>“Ming Yue…,” the person in black softly said. His voice was hoarse and slightly trembling as if he was suppressing his emotions.</p>
 <p>“What did you say?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi thought she heard the two words ‘Ming Yue’, but she wasn’t sure. When she looked again, the person in black had recovered his composure. He looked deeply at Murong Qi Qi once. Then he turned and jumped into the bushes.</p>
 <p>“Miss, what’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>Su Yue, who'd already dressed, came over. When Murong Qi Qi looked again, the person in black was gone.</p>
 <p>“There’s a stranger here!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi pointed in the direction the person in black had disappeared.</p>
 <p>The moment she heard a stranger had broken in, Su Yue immediately rushed over there. Su Mei also heard the noise. After hearing the commotion at the women's side, the men also found out that a person in black had appeared. Feng Cang quickly got dressed and rushed to Murong Qi Qi’s side.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, are you alright?!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s voice returned Murong Qi Qi to sanity. She quickly picked up the Water Moon Mirror and attached it to her face.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>I’m fine and very safe!”</p>
 <p>After everyone got dressed, Su Yue came back.</p>
 <p>“That person in black is very familiar with the villa. This subordinate followed him to the plum garden and then lost sight of him.”</p>
 <p>Su Yue was a bit upset. She let the person in black escape under her eyes. Truly a dereliction of one’s duty.</p>
 <p>The moment he heard from Su Yue that the other party was very familiar with the villa, Feng Cang’s expression sank. He immediately summoned Fengyu villa’s housekeeper and let the whole villa be searched. However, they searched for a whole night, but they didn’t find a single sign&nbsp;of the person in black. This matter caused&nbsp;suspense.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Who is he?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi bit her lips and recalled that person’s stature and then painted out that man’s appearance. When Feng Cang saw the doll face on the painting, Feng Cang was surprised.</p>
 <p>“This is a powder doll mask that father had bought for me when I was a child!”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, the housekeeper of Fengyu villa immediately went to the study to search. He found that the only thing missing was a doll mask.</p>
 <p>It seemed that this person was very familiar with Fengyu villa! Who is he? Murong Qi Qi couldn’t think of anyone. Feng Cang also couldn’t think of anyone. The whole villa had been turned over, but there were&nbsp;no signs&nbsp;of that person in black. Feng Cang could only let people strengthen the patrol.</p>
 <p>After this, the person in black didn’t appear again. It was like he had evaporated from the world and never appeared again.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi constantly remembered everything about that person in black. She remembered he'd said the phrase ‘Ming Yue’. What does this Ming Yue mean? Is it princess Ming Yue? It’s just, princess Ming Yue had already passed away for so many years; why would this person use this name with such deep feelings to call her?&nbsp; Could this person in black be a follower of princess Ming Yue?</p>
 <p>These questions had been hovering in Murong Qi Qi’s mind. Before finding the answers to these questions, she won't tell Feng Cang about this. If the person in black comes&nbsp;again, she would catch him and let him make all of these clear!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Finally, the 30<sup>th</sup> of December arrived. This year, because of the tournament of the four countries, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi were able to spend the new year at Fengyu villa. To be able to spend the new year with Feng Cang, made Murong Qi Qi very happy. Presumably, the annual lively palace banquet and the cumbersome court etiquette just couldn’t compare to spending time with your beloved one.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>30th of December here&nbsp;refers to the Chinese lunar calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, it's somewhere between the end of January and the beginning of&nbsp;</em><i>February</i></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Beside Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, there were also Su Yue, Wanyan Kang, Jin Mo, Ruyi and Jixiang present.</p>
 <p>On the night of the 30<sup>th</sup> of December, Feng Cang announced that everyone at Fengyu villa, regardless their status, would not be going home before getting drunk. This made the people who looked after Fengyu villa very happy. Wanyan Kang held a wine gourd and drunk wine with Ruyi and Jin Mo. Su Mei, Su Yue and Ji Xiang, these three young girls, were chatting at one&nbsp;side. Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi laid&nbsp;on the heated brick bed and looked laughingly at the others.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>Fengyu villa’s housekeeper smilingly went&nbsp;to Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi while carrying wine.</p>
 <p>“This little one, as the representative of the people from Fengyu villa, toasts to <em>wangye </em>and <em>wangfei.</em>[2. Wangfei: the main wife/consort of the prince of first rank] I wish <em>wangye </em>and <em>wangfei</em> forever love and be together for hundred of years!”</p>
 <p>“Good!”</p>
 <p>The housekeeper’s words made the smile on Feng Cang’s face become wider. He raised his head and poured the cup of wine into his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Reward everyone a half month of salary!”</p>
 <p>“Thanking&nbsp;<em>wangye</em>! Thanking&nbsp;<em>wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>The moment they heard that there was a reward and also&nbsp;half a month's salary, it made those people of Fengyu villa so happy, they all toasted to&nbsp;Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Although they only spent a few days together, but these people deeply felt the harmony of Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Having a good-tempered and easy-to-get-along-with&nbsp;<em>wangfei</em> was the best thing for these people. Although Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi wouldn’t be coming here often, but looking at the two masters, they felt that every winter they would be staying at Fengyu villa. If the master was good-tempered, then it was&nbsp;easy to serve, making the people save a lot of troubles.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>it’s time!”</p>
 <p>Finally, midnight&nbsp;arrived. Feng Cang held Murong Qi Qi, and went outside, escorted by the crowd. Fengyu villa was lit up brightly. When Feng Cang came out, the people who'd already prepared the fireworks, lit them up.</p>
 <p>‘Boom!’</p>
 <p>Beautiful fireworks bloomed in the quiet night. It was a light colored brush and painted the dark sky with vivid&nbsp;colors.</p>
 <p>‘Boom, boom, boom!’</p>
 <p>Those fireworks opened as if it was a flower festival and met the arrival of the new year!</p>
 <p>“So beautiful! Miss, look, that one is so beautiful!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei liked to be lively and liked beautiful fireworks even more. Wanyan Kang came to her side and gave her two fireworks.</p>
 <p>“Here!”</p>
 <p>“Thanks!”</p>
 <p>With one firework in the left hand and one in the right hand, Su Mei danced in the night.</p>
 <p>“Beautiful! Oh…,” Wanyan Kang roared. He also took two fireworks and danced together with Su Mei. With fireworks as weapon, the two ‘fought’ in the courtyard. The two ‘fought’ busily. The fireworks in their hands emitted a dazzling light. The light enveloped the two of them, making them appear even more beautiful.</p>
 <p>“So beautiful! Su Yue, go play! Jixiang, Ruyi, you also go play!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei’s and Wanyan Kang’s liveliness made Murong Qi Qi’s mood very good. Everyone lit one firework. A group of people holding fireworks began to play in the courtyard.</p>
 <p>“Miss, it’s time. Make a wish, make a wish! Quickly make a wish!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei began to shout. Murong Qi Qi quickly put her hands together, closed her eyes and made a wish. After she told Buddha all her wishes, Murong Qi Qi opened her eyes. She discovered a devilishly beautiful face had appeared in front of her.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>…”</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, does your new year’s wish include&nbsp;me?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang looked forward to hearing the answer, but he suppressed the excitement in his heart for fear that Murong Qi Qi would laugh at him.</p>
 <p>“What did you say?”</p>
 <p>Seeing Feng Cang like that, Murong Qi Qi winked at him flirtatiously and also gave him an ambiguous answer.</p>
 <p>The more Murong Qi Qi acted like that, the more anxious Feng Cang got. He simply pulled Murong Qi Qi into his arms and wrapped the two of them in his cloak.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, if you don’t answer me, then I’ll kiss you!”</p>
 <p>“Oh!”</p>
 <p>Inside of the cloak, Feng Cang continued to coax. Just when Feng Cang wrapped the two of them in the cloak and isolated them from the others, it attracted the attention of the others.</p>
 <p>“Cousin brother, what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang asked exaggeratedly. The people beside him laughed.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>...”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi blushed. She didn’t expect that Feng Cang would do something like this in front of so many people.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, answer me or let me kiss you.”</p>
 <p>Inside the cloak, the heat was very strong. Feng Cang could feel that his face had become hot. However, he didn’t intend to let Murong Qi Qi off so easily.</p>
 <p>“Answer…”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s hot breath was getting closer to Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi could feel the hot temperature of Feng Cang’s body. Her face burned. She was just about to answer when Feng Cang’s lips was already&nbsp;on hers.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, I love you…”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s voice had been swallowed by Murong Qi Qi’s lips.&nbsp; The word ‘love’ was also in his kiss and spread to her heart.</p>
 <p>Although this kiss was still not skilled, but Feng Cang was no longer shaky as the first time. His tongue explored the fragrance of her mouth. Not too deep, not too shallow; just right.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang pulled the cloak with one hand and blocked the two of them from the others. The other hand held Murong Qi Qi’s slim waist, forcing her to get closer to him.</p>
 <p>“Mm…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s lips were blooming like flowers and meet the gentleness of Feng Cang. Her toes also gradually left the ground. Outside the cloak, the fireworks continued to fire. Inside the cloak, the two were kissing in full swing.</p>
 <p>Only when their surroundings had&nbsp;quietened down, did Feng Cang slowly release Murong Qi Qi’s lips. This kiss took a long time; so long that Feng Cang had forgotten that outside, there was a crowd watching in fun. When he put down the cloak, Wanyan Kang’s whistle immediately came over.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s red, swollen lips told everyone who saw them,&nbsp; exactly what had happened between the two of them inside the cloak. Wanyan Kang shouted in surprise: “Cousin brother is powerful, ah! So long! We waited from this year till next year, you two almost kissed for a year, ah!”</p>
 <p>The moment she heard Wanyan Kang's words, Murong Qi Qi’s face was red like it was on fire. It burned. Her whole body hid in Feng Cang’s arms and she refused to raise her head.</p>
