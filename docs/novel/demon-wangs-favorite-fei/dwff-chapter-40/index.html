 <p>Chapter 40 Chop him for bengong</p>
 <p>Facing Longze Yu Er’s bossy attitude, Fang Tong’s expression remained the same and his voice was still stable.</p>
 <p>“Answering princess, first I don’t belong to the dog group of the Chinese zodiac. Although my eyes are small, but my vision is very good. Second, our Jue Se Feng sells clothes in order of the first one who came is the first one served. No matter who you are, what your identity is and how noble you are, when you come to our Jue Se Fang you all are our guests. We will treat everyone equally.”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong’s decent appearance and humorous discourse, let Feng Cang appreciate him very much. This appreciation even reached to Guang Hua <em>gongzi</em> [1. Gongzi: Young master/ also used to refer a famous unmarried man] who is behind this Jue Se Fang. Being able to teach his subordinate like this, this Guang Hua <em>gongzi </em>is no ordinary person.</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian saw that Longze Yu Er suffered defeat, immediately came forward.</p>
 <p>“This dress has been fancied by princess. You just need to sell. Is it not money, how much do you want?”</p>
 <p>“Ten thousand golden teals.”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong shouted the price. It directly let Murong Xin Lian’s eyelid jump.</p>
 <p>“Ten thousand? Golden teals! You want to slaughter people, ah!”</p>
 <p>“You are?”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong squinted his eyes and pretended to not know Murong Xin Lian’s identity.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian stroked her clothes and raised her sharp chin.</p>
 <p>“I’m Jing <em>wangfei</em>[2. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye]!”</p>
 <p>“Oh……”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong stretched his voice.</p>
 <p>“Seemingly Xi Qi country’s Jing <em>wang</em>[3. Wang/ wangye: prince pf the first rank] only has a <em>ce fei</em>[4. Cefei/cewangfei: second ranked wife of a wangye]……”</p>
 <p>“You……”</p>
 <p>The thing that Murong Xin Lian is now most tangled about is her own status. Why is it not <em>wangfei</em>? Why is there a ‘ce’ in front? Because of this she is actually being laughed at by a small shopkeeper. Her expression immediately turned bad.</p>
 <p>“I will soon become <em>wangfei</em>!”</p>
 <p>While talking, Murong Xin Lian’s hand unconsciously touched her belly. This movement has been taken into Feng Cang’s eyes. So it’s like that. No wonder she is so arrogant. It’s because she already has something to rely on, ah!</p>
 <p>“Shopkeeper, here’s is ten thousand golden teals.”</p>
 <p>Ru Yi put a box in front of Fang Tong. He opened. Golden colors everywhere.</p>
 <p>“Our family’s young master has taken a fancy on this ‘Gold thread dress’. We paid the full amount. On the ninth we will come collect it.”</p>
 <p>Ru Yi polite manner and Longze Yu Er’s arrogance became a stark contrast. And his way was lavish making people unable to breath, making the other guests murmur at each other.</p>
 <p>“Since young master paid the full amount, this shop will make an exception and let young master take the dress first.”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong let people wrap the ‘Gold thread dress’ and smilingly handed the dress over to Ru Yi.</p>
 <p>“Young master must’ve brought this dress for your wife! Your wife is really lucky!”</p>
 <p>“Thanks……”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong using wife for Murong Qi Qi, making Feng Cang’s mood very good. That’s right ah, not much longer, she will become his bride, become his <em>wangfei</em>. <em>Furen&nbsp;</em>[5. Furen: One of the way in chinese to refer a wife]? Wife? Beloved consort? <em>Qing Qing</em>? Qi <em>er</em>[6. Er: term of endearment]……Using these nicknames for her is really not bad.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Qing Qing: term of endearments between spouses.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Stop!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Feng Cang and Ru Yi walked to the door with the ‘Gold thread dress’ that she fancied, Longze Yu Er didn’t make trouble for Fang Tong anymore. Instead she let people block Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“You can leave, but you need to leave the dress here!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er stared at the ‘Gold thread dress ‘in Ru Yi’s hand. The golden sunlight shone on the gauze made it have a mysterious light. Longze Yu Er absolutely loves this dress. She definitely won’t allow such a beautiful dress being dressed on someone else!</p>
 <p>“Can it be that princess wants to be a robber in broad daylight?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s voice has a thin layer of coldness. Ru Yi knows his master’s mind. He immediately fired a firework in the sky. Red firework exploded in the air, really beautiful.</p>
 <p>Knowing that the other party is sending a sign for help, but Longze Yu Er isn’t afraid. Here is Xi Liang, Xi Qi’s capital. She is Xi Qi’s princess Ping Yang. Unless imperial father and mother is here, otherwise no one can stop her!</p>
 <p>“This dress is something <em>bengong</em>[7. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family] took a fancy on!”</p>
 <p>The men under Longze Yu Er already sent a messenger to the imperial guard of the capital. Seeing that man run faster than a monkey, Feng Cang revealed a bloodthirsty smile.</p>
 <p>“Nonsense! It’s obviously my young master who ordered it first and also paid ten thousand golden teals!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that the imperial guards of the capital have arrived, Ruyi stood in front of Feng Cang to protect him.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t expect that a princess of a country will be so rude and unreasonable! Can’t afford it, now turned into robbing. What kind of reason is this?! Do you still care about the law?”</p>
 <p>“Law?”</p>
 <p>Hearing this word, Longze Yu Er seemed like she heard the funniest thing in the world.</p>
 <p>“Laws are being made by my family. Here, <em>bengong </em>is the law!”</p>
 <p>The head of the imperial guards of the capital Hu Bu Xiu rushed over. The moment he saw Longze Yu Er, he got headache. This princess doesn’t have other skill than to order them to here and to there.</p>
 <p>A while ago when she wanted to seal Tong Bao Zhai, in the end, the result is that all the ladies of the whole capital have a grudge on him. Without Tong Bao Zhai, the jewelries they love so much are gone. They can’t do anything to princess, they can only use a black hand on him, this small head of the imperial guards. Even his own wife has punished him by not letting him sleep on the bed.</p>
 <p>Just a few days without trouble, princess Ping Yang once again made trouble. He really doesn’t know when there will be an end…...</p>
 <p>“This subordinate greets princess Ping Yang……”</p>
 <p>Although unwilling, Hu Bu Xiu still went forward and bowed. Who let the other party’s identity be so noble and her father is the biggest boss in this country!</p>
 <p>“You, go rob that dress for <em>bengong!</em>”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er pointed at Feng Cang. Murong Xin Lian at a side pulled Longze Yu Er’s sleeves. Only then did she change her words: “No, it’s get the dress for <em>bengong</em>!”</p>
 <p>“Princess, this dress is another’s. How can you……”</p>
 <p>‘Pa’. Longze Yu Er was full of anger and didn’t have a place to vent on. She heard Hu Bu Xiu’s words and immediately slapped him.</p>
 <p>“When did it become that when <em>bengong </em>does something, you, a slave, has the right to meddle in?! If you can’t take the burdens off <em>bengong, </em>then for what do I need you?!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er kicked Hu Bu Xiu away. She ordered to the guards at the back: “You all listen, who robs the ‘Gold thread dress’ for <em>bengong, bengong </em>will let him become the head of the imperial guards of the capital!”</p>
 <p>Those words fell into those guards’ ears, all of them exploded.</p>
 <p>The head of the imperial guards, everyone wants to sit on that position! Anyway, if something happens, there’s princess Ping Yang who will block for them. Also the other party just have one master and one servant. Their mind turned and immediately surrendered to Longze Yu Er.</p>
 <p>Just a moment, forty imperial guards have surrounded Feng Cang and Ru Yi. Their weapons pointed at this pair of master and servant. They have the posture as if they will use force.</p>
 <p>“Audacious!”</p>
 <p>Ru Yi didn’t expect that this group of people will actually listen to a woman and will use force to his <em>wangye</em>. If this is Bei Zhou, even if he gives them ten galls they won’t dare.</p>
 <p>“Puchi….,” not only Longze Yu Er, Murong Xin Lian also laughed. Just a servant, when talking he does looks like it. Saying such words when facing Xi Qi’s princess, his mind must’ve gotten into water.</p>
 <p>“Hey, hand over princess’s dress!”</p>
 <p>Someone’s hand is on the swords. His posture is like if Feng Cang doesn’t hand over the dress, he’ll do something to him.</p>
 <p>Seeing the other party like this, Feng Cang humphed coldly.</p>
 <p>“What if <em>benwang</em>[8. Benwang: I, used by a wangye] says no?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Did you hear, he actually said <em>benwang</em>! <em>Benwang?”</em></p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er laughed out loud. The hairpins and beads on her head also shook.</p>
 <p>“Audacious commoner, you actually dare to impersonate a <em>wangye. </em>Really a sin to die one million times! Chop him for <em>bengong!”</em></p>
