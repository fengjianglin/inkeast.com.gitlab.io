 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 81 The out of control Nan Lin Wang (1)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Dei galloped away on their horses. They didn’t even turn back their heads, fearing that the man with the scar may regret his actions and bring them back.</p>
 <p>When the two were far away, the man with the scar and the others dismounted their horses. They came to Murong Qi Qi and bowed respectfully.</p>
 <p>“Miss!”</p>
 <p>“Mm!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi turned and swept her eyes over these serious faces, one by one. Then she laughed.</p>
 <p>“Brothers, long time no see! Looks like you are in great spirits!”</p>
 <p>“Heihei, miss, we’re all very good. We just miss you!”</p>
 <p>The shorty touched his head and laughed,</p>
 <p>“Su Mei sent a letter and said there are people who want to harm you. We rushed over. Miss, you won’t blame us for being meddlesome, right?!”</p>
 <p>“How would I?! You came at the right time!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar led a horse to Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi mounted the horse. She changed from the weak appearance to a formidable and valiant look.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go! Let’s get those two bitches back!”</p>
 <p>On the road, Murong Qi Qi found out that when she had left, Su Mei had been following them. Later, she sent a pigeon with a letter to the man with the scar which resulted in them waiting here.</p>
 <p>“Tie Xue, you said you encountered Wu Ji Gong’s people?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was somewhat surprised. She also told the man with the scar about Wu Ji Gong’s soft fragrance powder.</p>
 <p>“Then where are Wu Ji Gong’s people? Where did you bring them to?”</p>
 <p>“Killed.”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar laughed.</p>
 <p>“They are just some disdainful things. Killed them to avoid them dirtying miss’s eyes!”</p>
 <p>“Not bad! We can push this matter onto Wu Ji Gong’s head!”</p>
 <p>Not long after, Murong Qi Qi and the others caught up with Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die. When the two saw that the man with the scar had chased after them, they were very scared.</p>
 <p>“What do you want to do? Didn’t you say that you will let us go? Why do you go back on your words now?”</p>
 <p>“I indeed wanted to let you guys go, but my family’s miss is unwilling.”</p>
 <p>The men opened a road. Murong Qi Qi riding a horse, went to Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>“The two of you run really slow, ah!”</p>
 <p>“You! It’s you!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was very surprised. After the surprise, came the anger.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, you actually colluded with bandits and wanted to plot against <em>bengong[1. Bengong: this palace/ I, used by females of the imperial family]</em>!”</p>
 <p>“Zezeze!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi gently clapped.</p>
 <p>“Thief calling thief. Princess’s ability to bite is very good, ah! If it wasn’t because you deliberately took me out of the city and also used soft fragrance powder in the incense, I’ll also wouldn’t think of a way&nbsp;to deal with you. Now, you’re saying that I plotted against princess; then if I don’t kill you, then wouldn’t I let your good intentions go to waste?!”</p>
 <p>“You, you dare……”</p>
 <p>‘Shua……’</p>
 <p>The right hand Wanyan Bao Zhu used to point at Murong Qi Qi was&nbsp;cut off by the shorty.</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous! Dared to be rude to miss!”</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu felt so much pain that she rolled onto the ground. Blood splashed onto the white snow. Red bright stars, very beautiful, but after&nbsp;a moment, they were frozen by the cold weather.</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die was now completely scared. She didn’t know what to say. She could only stare blankly at Murong Qi Qi. Below, something warm rolled down and wet her pants. Miss, what kind of miss? What relation does Murong Qi Qi have with these people? What’s going on?</p>
 <p>“Say, where did the soft fragrance powder come from? Who contacted those people from Wu Ji Gong?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi dismounted the horse. Stepping onto the snow, she came towards Wanyan Bao Zhu. The whip in her hand gently hit the ground, splashing a few pieces of snow which flew to Wanyan Bao Zhu’s face, making her numb because of the cold.</p>
 <p>“Chou, Chou <em>er[2. Er: term of endearment]</em>……”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu felt very painful, but this cold weather kept her mind awake, making her unable to faint.</p>
 <p>“Chou <em>er</em>?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi frowned. She remembered this time, there was indeed a woman who followed behind Wanyan Bao Zhu. It’s just that woman was covered with a veil and she didn’t care. But now, thinking about it, that Chou <em>er</em> definitely was strange. Could it be this Chou <em>er</em>&nbsp;was one of Wu Ji Gong’s people? But Wu Ji Gong don’t know that she's Du Xian Er. If they knew, they would have&nbsp;anxiously turned their backs and run, how would they come and search for trouble? It seems that there are some secrets that aren’t known yet.</p>
 <p>“Got it.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi turned. A scream could be heard. The man with the scar had already gotten rid of Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>“Don’t, don’t kill me. I don’t, I don’t know anything……”</p>
 <p>Witnessing Wanyan Bao Zhu being killed by the man with the scar, Mu Yu Die was so scared that she slid off the horse and sat paralyzed on the ground. Her voice trembled and her teeth clattered against each other, making ‘gege’ sounds.</p>
 <p>“I, I really don’t know anything. Everything was done by princess, it’s not me……”</p>
 <p>“Miss Mu!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi squatted in front of Mu Yu Die. Seeing the smile on Murong Qi Qi’s face, Mu Yu Die backed two steps away. Her eyes were full of fear.</p>
 <p>“It’s really not me. It has nothing to do with me! Princess said I only needed to be a witness……. Don’t kill me.”</p>
 <p>“Witness?”</p>
 <p>Hearing this word, Murong Qi Qi immediately got an idea. The next moment, a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant appeared in her hand.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be afraid. Look at it and forget everything that had just happened. You don’t know anything. Don’t know anything…….”</p>
 <p>“Don’t know anything,” Mu Yu Die obediently followed what Murong Qi Qi said. She stared at the pendant and slowly repeated the words Murong Qi Qi said. Her eyes slowly became lifeless.</p>
 <p>“Don’t know anything. I don’t know anything……”</p>
 <p>After Mu Yu Die collapsed, Murong Qi Qi retrieved her hand and mounted the horse.</p>
 <p>“Tie Xue, leave some people to clean up here. Don’t let people find out anything. Bring them to the side of those corpses of Wu Ji Gong. This is done by Wu Ji Gong. It has nothing to do with us.”</p>
 <p>“Miss, why did you leave that bitch’s life? She’s also an accomplice! Anyone who deals against miss deserves to die!”</p>
 <p>On the vast snow, Murong Qi Qi was riding a horse at the front. Beside her followed the man with the scar. Behind them followed that group of people. The man with the scar was somewhat unhappy about Murong Qi Qi letting Mu Yu Die off the hook. From his point of view, the ones who offended miss, their fate could only be death. Letting Mu Yu Die go, she got off the hook too easy!</p>
 <p>“Tie Xue, killing people won’t solve the problem.” Murong Qi Qi smiled. “Sometimes, living can be more painful than death for some people. Besides, saving one’s life will enable you to build the seven-floor pagoda. This miss is kind hearted. Sparing her means amassing good fortune……”</p>
 <p>[caption id="attachment_19942" align="aligncenter" width="220"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-19942" src="http://volarenovels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/guilin-china-moon-pagoda-shan-hu-lake-26090081-220x300.jpg" alt width="220" height="300"> In ancient china, it's believed that if you lived with a kind heart, you will be able to build more floors of the pagoda[/caption]</p>
 <p>“Miss, don’t scare us! If you are kind-hearted, then wouldn't our Moyu be a Buddha to release all living creatures from suffering?”</p>
 <p>The shorty’s voice came from behind, making the group of people laugh.</p>
 <p>They had lived together for five years. How would these people not understand Murong Qi Qi’s ways! Murong Qi Qi left Mu Yu Die alive, presumably because she had another use! The shorty pitied Mu Yu Die from the bottom of his heart. Being left alive by miss is not her blessing. It’s her fate!</p>
 <p>“Talkative!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi looked back. The whip knocked the shorty’s head.</p>
 <p>“Fang Jing, did you do&nbsp;the things I ordered you to do, done? Where did you chose to be the world’s number one place of business?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi ask about this thing, the shorty immediately let his horse catch up with Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Miss, I found a <em>fengshui</em> treasured ground. That ground is really good! The place is surrounded by three cliffs, with only one road to go up! As long as we occupy the ground, even if people want to attack us, they would be unable to go up!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Fengshui: is a Chinese philosophical of harmonizing everyone with the surrounding environment---from Wikipedia</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>The place the shorty was talking about was called Wind Chase Cliff. These cliffs towered till the clouds. Only a small road to go up. All three sides had a cliff. Under the cliff was&nbsp;the raging Nu river. It’s a good place. Before, when Murong Qi Qi looked at the map, she also took a fancy to&nbsp;Wind Chase Cliff. She didn’t expect that the shorty and her would have the exact same thought.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the shorty was so confident, Murong Qi Qi sincerely wanted to make things difficult for him.</p>
 <p>“Ah, if there’s a really able person who was able to go up with his martial arts, by then do you want us jump off the cliff and be buried in the Nu river?”</p>
 <p>“Miss, you saying those words, is like not believing me! With my ability, not even a half year, I absolutely can make a secret road out! By then, we won’t be afraid of anything! Really, miss, I didn’t lie!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi talk like that, the shorty became anxious. He immediately explained his design.</p>
 <p>“Should I sketch the design out for miss to take a look?! I didn’t brag!”</p>
 <p>“Alright! I was teasing you!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the shorty being angry till his face became red, Murong Qi Qi laughed out loud.</p>
 <p>“You, Fang Jing handling the affairs, of course I’m at ease. But I want to take a look at the design. After all, this place will be the base of our Moyu in the future. I can’t take brother’s life as a joke!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi saying ‘brother’ repeatedly, made these people very moved. Beside fighting and killing, they didn’t know anything else. Since miss came, these people slowly began to have a backbone. They know miss is good towards them, so they are very loyal towards Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“But……,” hearing Murong Qi Qi say that, the shorty was very happy, but his expression showed some hesitation.</p>
 <p>“But what?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the shorty being so reluctant, Murong Qi Qi reined her horse.</p>
 <p>“Say it!”</p>
 <p>“Yes! Miss, Wind Chase Cliff is a place of Fu Sheng Men. Before, I wanted to buy it, they didn’t want to sell. They said what they have is money!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Fu Sheng Men is a ‘good’ sect.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Mentioning the people of Fu Sheng Men, the shorty got angry.</p>
 <p>“They said such a matter, we need to find the head of their sect. Who doesn’t know that the head of Fu Sheng Men, Long Ao Tian, is like a ghost. We searched for a long time and still didn’t find that bastard!”</p>
 <p>Fu Sheng Men, the organization in this mainland which made people change color whenever they hear about it. No one knew where the disciples of Fu Sheng Men were. Also, no one knew who the head of Fu Sheng Men was. Everyone knew that&nbsp;in this black world, Fu Sheng Men was the emperor.</p>
 <p>Assassinating with poison, no one was&nbsp;better at it than Moyu. However, Moyu had always been not much trouble. Moyu’s sir Mozun was also only obsessed with poisonous things. He had never involved himself in other matters and was&nbsp;<em>water from the well doesn’t bother with water from the river </em>with the other sects. Moyu could be considered one of the oldest surviving sects in this black world.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Water from the well doesn’t bother with water from the river: everyone minds their own business.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Fu Sheng Men was&nbsp;the contrary of Moyu. Fu Sheng Men was established ten years ago. Within only five years’ time, it eliminated the black world, annexed large and small sects and became the boss of the underground kingdom.</p>
 <p>It’s said that Long Ao Tian’s ways were ruthless; that no one could compare. Before, when annexing the other sects, as&nbsp;he met with rebels, he’d kill all without mercy. However, he was also a very capable person. He created Fu Sheng Men. In a short time, he brought Fu Sheng Men to such a great height. Their power was extraordinary.</p>
 <p>However, Fu Sheng Men and Moyu didn’t have any conflicts of interest. Plus, sir Mozun once helped out Fu Sheng Men when it was in trouble. So, Long Ao Tian also remembered this kindness. Both sides were at peace.</p>
 <p>Now, seeing the shorty’s expression, Murong Qi Qi laughed. Fang Jing&nbsp;was pretty good at everything. Especially at manufacturing, he was a genius. There’s just one bad thing. He had a really bad temper. He could compete with Su Mei at that.</p>
 <p>“Miss, why are you smiling? Wind Chasing Cliff really is a good <em>fengshui </em>place. I can bring you to take a look! I did according to miss and traveled to the sixteen states. I only took a fancy to such a place! Using this place to build the world’s first place of business is really too good.”</p>
 <p>“Fang Jing, since we can’t buy it with money, then we’ll snatch it.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s face turned serious.</p>
 <p>“If they don’t give, then rob it!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words were like a bandit’s, making everyone surprised for a moment.</p>
 <p>“Miss, do you mean what you said? Really rob it?”</p>
 <p>The shorty didn’t believe it and asked one more question: “That’s Fu Sheng Men’s territory! Going head on? This is really good, ah! I didn’t take action for a long time! My hands are really itching. Really don’t know if it’s Fu Sheng Men who is more powerful or if it’s us who is more powerful……”</p>
 <p>‘Pa!’</p>
 <p>Not waiting for the shorty to finish, the whip in Murong Qi Qi’s hands once again landed on the shorty’s head.</p>
 <p>“Only knows fighting and killing. How many times have I told you, when the problem can be solved with brains, then don’t use the hands! Also, people should have self-confidence. It’s of course, our Moyu who is one level higher. Could it be that this miss can’t be compared to Long Ao Tian?!”</p>
 <p>“Yes! Yes! It’s I who said the wrong thing! With miss here, why bother who he is? Everyone will become side dishes!”</p>
 <p>The shorty suffered defeat. He laughed twice and touched his head.</p>
 <p>“However, what should we do? Miss, there are already movements in Nan Feng country. Not even a month’s time, Ming Yue Cheng will accomplish his mission. We did business in the sixteen states, we must have a place to build our roots, ah!”</p>
 <p>“<em>U</em><em>nder the whole heaven, every spot is the sovereign's ground. To the borders of the land, every individual is the sovereign's minister.</em> Didn’t you say this place is within Yongzhou? This Yongzhou is Bei Zhou’s territory. I don’t believe Fu Sheng Men can go against the imperial power! Leave this matter to me!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>U</em><em>nder the whole heaven, every spot is the sovereign's ground. To the borders of the land, every individual is the sovereign's minister: </em>All the lands and people belong to the emperor.</li>

 <p>Murong Qi Qi said that, the man with the scar and shorty understood. Murong Qi Qi will use Feng Cang as a way out.</p>
 <p>“Miss, no! We can’t sacrifice you because of this matter! Feng Cang that sicko is not good enough for miss. I won’t let miss sacrifice your sex appeal!”</p>
 <p>‘Pa!’</p>
 <p>The shorty received one more whip on the head. The two times before, it only made his head itchy. This time, Murong Qi Qi used a third of her power, making the shorty jump while clutching his head.</p>
 <p>“Miss, what I said is the truth. You want to seduce Feng Cang. We all object!”</p>
 <p>“Pei!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the shorty bring out the words she usually said, such as ‘seduce’, Murong Qi Qi said a ‘pei’.</p>
 <p>“Do I look like such people? Fang Jing, what kind of mess is your head thinking about all&nbsp;day? Could it be that after you got over adolescence, your heart is beginning to stir? Do you want me to search a wife for you to let her console you the whole night?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words amused everyone, making them laugh. Feng Jing quickly waved his hand. His face was red like a tomato.</p>
 <p>“No, don’t need! I didn’t mean it like that! I don’t want women!”</p>
 <p>After laughing, Tie Xue said: “Miss, do you want to start from Nan Lin <em>wang?[3. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank]</em>&nbsp;There is&nbsp;a way. The Bei four states are Nan Lin <em>wang’s </em>fief. As long as he nods, this way is possible. It’s just, we don’t know if Nan Lin <em>wang </em>and Fu Sheng Men have any kind of relation with each other. Why does Long Ao Tian have territory in the Bei four states?”</p>
 <p>After the man with the scar said that, Murong Qi Qi thought for a long time. If Feng Cang does indeed have&nbsp;some kind of relationship with Long Ao Tian, then will&nbsp;he continue the friendship with Long Ao Tian or will he take her side? In this&nbsp;short time, Feng Cang was that good to her. This matter would be a good test.</p>
 <p>Men, if they truly loved a woman, they would&nbsp;not wait to dig their hearts and lungs out for her. Not to mention those mere possessions! A man not willing to spend money on a woman was not a good man. Equally, a man who didn’t make a woman’s wish come true was also not a good man. When loving a person, you needed to fulfill all her requirements and not only talk emptily about love. Is that not a thankless wretch?!</p>
 <p>“I’ll go try. If it really can’t be done, then let’s snatch it! I’ve taken a fancy to Wind Chase Cliff. Our world’s best place of business must be built there!”</p>
 <p>When saying those words, Murong Qi Qi’s attitude was very firm. Even Tie Xue and Fang Jing were&nbsp;shocked and in awe of their miss’s powerful aura. This is their Moyu’s miss. This is their head! Need this kind of aura! Tie Xue and Fang Jing exchanged a smile.</p>
 <p>On the other side, when Zhao Lang and Chou <em>er</em> arrived, the blood on the ground had been frozen. Seeing those bodies of his underlings, Zhao Lang expression changed. He reached out to explore. All ten people didn’t have breath.</p>
 <p>“How? Did they all die? Who did it?”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er</em> clutched her mouth and looked at the bloody ice. She didn’t expect that the result would be like this.</p>
 <p>“Don’t know.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Lang’s face became sullen. Suddenly, he saw Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die at one&nbsp;side. He immediately approached and inspected. He found out that Mu Yu Die had fainted and Wanyan Bao Zhu had not only broken her right hand, but her death was extremely tragic.</p>
