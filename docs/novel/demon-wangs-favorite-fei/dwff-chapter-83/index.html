 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 83 Seduce (1)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Just when everything was ready, Feng Cang mounted Snow and was about to go search for Murong Qi Qi, when a soft voice appeared at the corner.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye[1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank]</em>……”</p>
 <p>That gentle voice let the tight string in Feng Cang’s heart relax immediately. Following the voice, he saw Murong Qi Qi running towards him.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye!” </em></p>
 <p>“Qing Qing!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for people to understand, a burst of wind passed and wrapped Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>I’m back.”</p>
 <p>Listening to Murong Qi Qi’s voice, feeling the temperature of her body and smelling the fragrance from her hair, Feng Cang’s heart finally calmed down. Holding her like this really is a good feeling! Before, Feng Cang thought about numerous possibilities and was worried that something had&nbsp;happened to Murong Qi Qi. Now that Murong Qi Qi was standing in front of him, unscratched and in a good condition, he was so happy.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi coming back made everyone let out a breath of relief. Especially those people who had followed Feng Cang for a long time. Fortunately, princess Zhao Yang came back. Otherwise, they really didn’t know what kind of crazy thing their master would have done!</p>
 <p>“Cousin-in-law, fortunately you came back. Cousin brother almost turned Yongzhou over!”</p>
 <p>Now, Wanyan Kang also let out a deep breath of relief. Just now, Feng Cang wanted to kill Wanyan Bao Zhu. His gaze didn’t seem like he was joking. He was not only saying that. Just now, he was worried about what he should do if Feng Cang wanted to kill Wanyan Bao Zhu!</p>
 <p>Although Wanyan Kang didn’t like Wanyan Bao Zhu, but after all, they’re half siblings. Something happening to his little sister in front of his eyes; by then, he, as a big brother, also can’t escape being blamed.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang’s voice, full of laughter, finally let the two people who were hugging, separate. Murong Qi Qi blushed and apologized to Feng Cang while feeling sorry: “I’m sorry. Originally, I wanted to come earlier, but I didn’t know the way and circled around the city for a long time.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s nose was red because of the cold. Coupled with that pair of watery eyes, she looked like a small animal arousing the affection of people.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine as long as you come back!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang knew that other words were unnecessary. As long as Murong Qi Qi is safe and sound, to him that’s the best thing!</p>
 <p>“That’s right! As long as cousin-in-law comes back, it’s fine! Otherwise, cousin brother will really vent his anger on imperial little sister!”</p>
 <p>“Imperial little sister?”</p>
 <p>Only after hearing this, did Murong Qi Qi see&nbsp;Wanyan Bao Zhu, who was standing at one&nbsp;side with her head lowered.</p>
 <p>How can this be?! Murong Qi Qi screamed in her heart. Wanyan Bao Zhu had died at the hands of Tie Xue. Why was she (WBZ) now standing in front of her (MQQ), very much alive?</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t speak. Wanyan Bao Zhu’s heart jumped badly. What should she do? What should she do? If Murong Qi Qi found out that she’s a fake, what should she do? Where’s Zhao Lang? Zhao Lang, where are you?! Zhao Lang, you must save me, ah!</p>
 <p>“Princess?,” Murong Qi Qi probed.</p>
 <p>“You’ve come back! So good!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu revealed an ugly smile.</p>
 <p>“It’s alright, nothing happened! We were so worried about you!”</p>
 <p>Hearing the other party speak, Murong Qi Qi immediately knew that she’s not Wanyan Bao Zhu! Wanyan Bao Zhu’s voice was very arrogant and this voice was very introverted. Besides, Wanyan Bao Zhu would never look at her with such fear. There must be some secret.</p>
 <p>In just&nbsp;a moment, Murong Qi Qi analysed the matter very clearly. Since this person was a fake, then there must be a conspiracy behind it. Instead of exposing this fake Wanyan Bao Zhu and cut the clues of the one behind it, she might as well <em>follow the vine to get to the melon </em>and find the one behind this!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Follow the vine to get to the melon: to track the clues</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Um, I’ve come back. Before, I was worried about princess and miss Mu. I didn’t think that you would be safe. I can be at ease now!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t seem like she was faking it. When Wanyan Bao Zhu saw that she didn’t see through her, her sinking heart slowly calmed down.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine. We’re fine. It’s fine that we’re alright. It’s fine that we’re alright……”</p>
 <p>After Murong Qi Qi’s safe return, Feng Cang immediately went with her into Meixiang <em>yuan[2. Yuan: part of a residence]</em>&nbsp;while hugging. The moment they entered the room, Feng Cang let Murong Qi Qi sit on his lap.</p>
 <p>“What happened? Did they do it?”</p>
 <p>The coldness inside Feng Cang’s phoenix eyes completely disappeared. He didn’t forget the initiator because of Murong Qi Qi's safe return. Calculating Murong Qi Qi, tricking his woman? Those two people have great courage! It seems that he hasn’t killed for a long time, so people have forgotten his ways!</p>
 <p>“I’m fine!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi softly leaned onto Feng Cang’s arms. She felt the most safe in his arms.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>can this matter be handed over for me to deal with? I've already thought of a way to deal with them!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi saying that made Feng Cang realise&nbsp;that was indeed Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die who made&nbsp;a trap. However, she said she wanted to deal with it personally, making Feng Cang surprised.</p>
 <p>“Alright! How they should be dealt with, you can see to it! Even if you want their heads, I’ll support you! However, you need to tell me what has happened!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi said in a simple manner about how she met Wu Ji Gong’s people on the way, but then&nbsp;a group of people appeared to help. She took the opportunity, stole a horse and ran away. She waited till it was safe before coming back.</p>
 <p>“Wu Ji Gong!”</p>
 <p>Hearing about Wu Ji Gong once again, Feng Cang’s eyes became cold again. Humph! Originally, he thought that if Zhao Lang&nbsp;behaved a little, then he wouldn’t bother with him (ZL) too much. Now, it seemed that this person was a miserable wretch. You let him be noble, so why can’t he become someone noble?</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>I also don’t know when I offended Wu Ji Gong’s people. Those people said they wanted to kill me and go back to get a reward. <em>Wangye, </em>who is the person behind them? Who hates me so much and wants to kill me!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Feng Cang’s tone, Murong Qi Qi fanned the flames. What is lending a knife to kill somebody? That’s using another’s hand to get rid of your enemy.</p>
 <p>Today, Wu Ji Gong completely offended Murong Qi Qi. Wanyan Bao Zhu hooked on Wu Ji Gong’s people and let them come harm her, she's afraid that inside, there’s definitely some shady activities! Since Wu Ji Gong’s people came to Yongzhou, why should she not use Feng Cang’s hands to clean them up?!</p>
 <p>“You didn’t offend them. It’s me who implicated you.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang bit Murong Qi Qi’s ear.</p>
 <p>In Feng Cang’s point of view, the main lead behind all of this was definitely Wanyan Hong.</p>
 <p>Zhao Lang was just a dog of Wanyan Hong. The big tree behind Wu Ji Gong&nbsp;was Wanyan Hong. Besides, these past few years, Wu Ji Gong did many things for Wanyan Hong. It seems&nbsp;that he needs to get rid of Wu Ji Gong, breaking Wanyan Hong’s left and right hands to let him know how much he truly is worth.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>then are you alright?!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang saying that, Murong Qi Qi immediately became worried. What has Feng Cang done that he provoked Wu Ji Gong? Although Wu Ji Gong was&nbsp;nothing but a rookie, but they were in the dark and Feng Cang was in the light. What should she do if Zhao Lang played the dark ways?</p>
 <p>It seemed that before, she was too kind-hearted. She didn’t get rid of Wu Ji Gong. They are now actually threatening to Feng Cang!&nbsp; Her man, only she can order and squeeze, how can other people bully him? Murong Qi Qi already made up her mind to get rid of Wu Ji Gong.</p>
 <p>What Murong Qi Qi didn’t know was, Feng Cang, because of her safety, also made the same decision.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, rest assured. Hand this matter over to me! I won’t let you suffer even a bit anymore!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>At night, inside Feng Cang’s room, it was still brightly lit. Jin Mo poured the brewed medicine in a bowl and put it on the table. Feng Cang was sitting and Nalan Xin was standing at the other side.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure? Only twenty-five? Including Zhao Lang?”</p>
 <p>“Answering chief, inside Yongzhou, there’s only twenty-five Wu Ji Gong’s people including the head of Wu Ji Gong, Zhao Lang. Gui Yan is watching them. We’re only waiting for lord’s command!”</p>
 <p>The one who looked over Murong Qi Qi in Xi Qi, Nalan Xin, now not even a trace of that pedantic appearance could be seen. Although his air of a scholar was still strong, but the killing intent inside the scholar aura was also very strong.</p>
 <p>“Kill!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang drank the medicine and put down the bowl. He put a candied fruit in his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Don’t let one off!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Zhao Lang who was living in the inn; at night, his left and right eyelids began to jump badly. He thought that it was because Wanyan Bao Zhu’s matter had gotten&nbsp;exposed. He sent out some people to go take a look, but he didn’t expect that the ones he had sent didn’t come back, making his heart become more uneasy.</p>
 <p>‘Dongdongdong!’</p>
 <p>Three knocks on the door. Zhao Lang’s heart tightened. He immediately asked: “Who is there?”</p>
 <p>“Lord, do you need special services?”</p>
 <p>A pretty voice came in. That voice seemed to be as&nbsp;sweet as wrapped in honey, making Zhao Lang’s whole body tingle. He immediately forgot all his troubles. He came to the door and glanced across it at the stature. Slim physique with a pair of watery eyes, which were blinking&nbsp;as though sending an arrow at him. Zhao Lang immediately surrendered. With a squeaky sound, the door opened.</p>
 <p>“Lord, your movement is very slow, yo!”</p>
 <p>The woman twisted her body and came in. As&nbsp;she was passing him, she sent him a tempting wink.</p>
 <p>That glance suddenly gave Zhao Lang an electric shock. Not waiting for Zhao Lang to understand, there was a dagger against his neck. He turned his head and saw that there was another person following behind that woman. From the stature, you could see that she’s also a woman. However, this woman had a veil on and her appearance couldn’t be seen.</p>
 <p>“What do you want to do?”</p>
 <p>The cold at his neck made Zhao Lang thoroughly sober up. From head to toe, he felt cold. If it wasn’t because there was a dagger at his neck, he really wanted to give himself two slaps on the face! How come he couldn’t change this lust problem? Why is it that every time he’ll get&nbsp;planted at this word ‘lust’! Obviously above the word lust is a dagger, so why could he still not hold himself in while seeing a beauty?!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>The Chinese word lust (?) have a dagger/knife (?) above it.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Lord, are you afraid?”</p>
 <p>The beauty took out a porcelain bottle and opened it. She put it under Zhao Lang’s nose to let him smell it.</p>
 <p>Not good! Zhao Lang was startled. It didn’t take long before his whole body weakened. His whole body felt soft and couldn’t use any energy.</p>
 <p>“Zeze, aren’t you the head of Wu Ji Gong? How come you can’t even handle a mere fragrant soft powder?”</p>
 <p>Retrieving the dagger, Su Mei retreated to a side. Murong Qi Qi slowly walked towards Zhao Lang.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Lang’s heart tightened. He also used poisons for many years. Such fragrance soft powder, even he couldn’t make it. Could it be that the other side was also a master at this? Then who could she be?</p>
 <p>This soft fragrance powder was able to act so fast. Only the people of Moyu can make such a drug. However, there were only a few women in Moyu. Now, two had appeared. Then who was the one talking? Zhao Lang suddenly made&nbsp;a bold assumption. Could the other party be Du Xian Er? Thinking about the name Du Xian Er, Zhao Lang couldn’t help but shiver. He immediately prayed that&nbsp;the woman in front of him&nbsp;did not have any relation with Du Xian Er.</p>
 <p>“Who I am is not important. What's important is, I want to know who sent you to deal with Feng Cang?!”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Zhao Lang was puzzled. If the other party was really someone from Moyu, then when did Moyu form a relationship with Feng Cang? Or was it that Moyu also wanted to deal with Feng Cang?</p>
 <p>“Talk!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Zhao Lang didn’t say anything, with one stroke Su Mei cut off Zhao Lang’s left ear. It was so painful that he wanted to shout, but he didn’t even have the energy to shout. Warm blood rolled down against his face, making his clothes red. Now, Zhao Lang is very sure that the other party was Du Xian Er. Only Du Xian Er would have such vicious tactics.</p>
 <p>“I’ll talk! I’ll talk! It’s Wanyan Hong! It’s Wanyan Hong who let me deal with Feng Cang! Wanyan Hong said that Feng Cang is his biggest threat. Only by&nbsp;getting rid of Feng Cang, would his place as the crown prince be secure!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi thought that she would need to use some more tactics before Zhao Lang confessed. She didn’t expect that with only an ear, he would&nbsp;blurt out Wanyan Hong. So, the one behind this was crown prince Wanyan Hong. It seemed that before, she guessed wrong. This Wanyan Hong was indeed a big problem.</p>
 <p>“Aside from Wanyan Hong, is there anyone else? What were you going to do?”</p>
 <p>“There’s no one else. My master is Wanyan Hong. Wanyan Hong let me find an opportunity to get rid of Feng Cang. If I couldn’t get rid of Feng Cang, then I had&nbsp;to kill Murong Qi Qi in order to leave a scar on Feng Cang’s heart. I was also forced, ah. Wanyan Hong said if I didn’t follow his request, he&nbsp;would eliminate Wu Ji Gong. Under me, there are more than a thousand people, ah. I can’t let them die!”</p>
 <p>Ordinarily, it was a very shameful thing, but coming from Zhao Lang, it had&nbsp;now become how much he loved and protected his subordinates; how in order to protect his men’s life, he had to follow Wanyan Hong’s commands.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Murong Qi Qi had a profound understanding of Wu Ji Gong and Zhao Lang. So, she didn’t believe a word of what he was saying. In her heart, she felt that’s very unfortunate for Wanyan Hong. This Zhao Lang was such a soft bone. After losing only one&nbsp;ear, he already betrayed Wanyan Hong. It seemed that this crown prince didn’t have a good eyesight for encountering such a treacherous person.</p>
 <p>“Master, someone is coming this way.”</p>
 <p>From outside, Su Yue’s voice came in. Murong Qi Qi already asked&nbsp;what she wanted to know. She nodded at Su Mei. The next moment, a silver light flashed. Zhao Lang’s head had been cut off while he was still alive. Su Mei quickly pulled the bed sheet, wrapped Zhao Lang’s head in it and followed Murong Qi Qi at jumping out of the window.</p>
 <p>When Nalan Xin arrived, he only saw a headless body kneeling on the ground. Blood stained the ground, making it look very terrifying.</p>
 <p>Who was it? Who acted before him? Nalan Xin frowned deeply. He carefully looked at the scene before leaving.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>That night, there was a big snow storm, falling like sand. In just one night, it let Yongzhou city be wrapped in a layer of silver. In the morning, Wanyan Bao Zhu woke up. After cleaning herself, she went outside. She didn’t expect that the moment she stepped out of the room, in front of the door, there would be a snowman that was as tall as a person.</p>
 <p>“Yong <em>er[3. Er: term of endearment]</em>, who made this snowman?”</p>
 <p>“Answering princess, this slave doesn’t know. This morning when this slave woke up, this snowman was already in the yard. Maybe someone else made it for fun.”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu stepped onto the snow and walked towards the snowman. She carefully&nbsp;looked at the snowman. This snowman was made to look extremely childish. On its head was a hat made from roof tiles. Its nose was a half-cut carrot. Those eyes, they seemed like the ones on a real person. Besides, they looked somewhat familiar.</p>
 <p>Looking at the black pupils, the more Wanyan Bao Zhu felt that they were familiar. Who do they&nbsp;resemble? After thinking for a long time, finally Wanyan Bao Zhu remembered. It resembled Zhao Lang. No wonder she felt it looked familiar! Who made the snowman to look so much like Zhao Lang. Especially those eyes. It felt like Zhao Lang was standing in front of her, looking at her.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu thought of Zhao Lang and also thought of their beautiful future together. She couldn’t help but reach out to touch that pair of eyes. Unexpectedly, just when she touched the snowman’s head, that white ball fell and rolled onto the ground, revealing a ray of black hair.</p>
 <p>“Princess, what is that?”</p>
 <p>Yong <em>er</em> followed next to Wanyan Bao Zhu. She carefully kicked the snowman’s head, but didn’t expect to see a head roll out.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Yong <em>er</em> screamed and hid behind Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>“Princess, what is that? Why does it look like a human’s head?!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Yong <em>er</em> say that, Wanyan Bao Zhu’s heart tightened. She rushed forward and carefully looked at it.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu staggered and fell onto the ground, full of snow. How come? How come it's Zhao Lang? She just saw him yesterday. Yesterday, they were still lovey dovey. Why did Zhao Lang become like this today?</p>
