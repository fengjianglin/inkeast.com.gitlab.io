 <p>Chapter 6: Big cousin brother and little cousin sister are Family</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian’s acting, Murong’s Qi Qi’s mouth twitched. This person really was a master at acting. If Murong Qing Lian continued on like this, sooner or later, she would suffer defeat at Murong Xin Lian’s hands.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was watching a play as she clutched her chest. Suddenly, she felt a gaze on her. She raised her head and saw Li Yun Qing.</p>
 <p>This man was really beautiful!</p>
 <p>Very black hair was hanging lazily behind the ears. A simple bamboo hairpin was in his hair. Dressed in emerald colored clothes that showed this man’s tall stature even more. Looking at those eyes, they were as gentle as the spring breeze in May. Just with one glance, it could warm a person’s heart.</p>
 <p>It was just that gentleness was also a knife. From the gentle eyes of that man, Murong Qi Qi saw the coldness at the bottom of those eyes. Such a man may seem gentle and passionate, but was actually the most ruthless. She must definitely not provoke him.</p>
 <p>With just one glance, Murong Qi Qi set Li Yun Qing on the side of never contacting again. Towards such a man who was soft on the surface but cold in the heart, Murong Qi Qi would unconsciously exclude him.</p>
 <p>Feeling that Li Yun Qing was looking at her with probing eyes, Murong Qi Qi lowered her eyes, clutched her chest and coughed softly as if that kick really did her some harm.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s cough broke the play that was just playing. Only now did Murong Tai saw the pale-faced Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Towards this daughter Murong Qi Qi, Murong Tai didn’t have any deep feelings. To Murong Tai, in this life he didn’t have any special regret. When he was young, his career rose meteorically. Later, he married one of the four great families, Li family’s eldest daughter. His worth became double of what it was. Now, he was above ten thousand of people and under one person. His eldest daughter was an Imperial Nobel Consort. So, he was very satisfied.</p>
 <p>If Murong Tai had sand in his eyes, the only sand in his eyes was his third daughter Murong Qi Qi. Xi Qi favored martial arts. Be it men or women, young or old, the nobility or the civilians, every one practiced martial arts. Respect came with martial arts. The first emperor, Emperor Gaozu got the world with martial arts. Martial arts was the national soul of Xi Qi. In Xi Qi, no matter if you were rich or poor, if you knew martial arts, you would be respected and you would succeed more easily.</p>
 <p>Although Murong Tai was a literary person, he also knew some kungfu. The concubines he married also had some skills; every child born had some good talent in learning martial arts.</p>
 <p>Originally, life could continue to be perfect like this, but this abnormal Murong Qi Qi appeared. More directly said, Murong Qi Qi was a rubbish. Since the test she received when she was one year old from a monk who’d concluded that she couldn’t practice martial arts, Murong Tai lost all hope in this daughter. Although she is a woman, she still couldn’t practice martial arts. She was nothing but something to warm the bed. She was just an useless rubbish.</p>
 <p>That was why, ever since then, Murong Tai discarded Murong Qi Qi in a remote house and was indifferent towards her. Even knowing that she wouldn’t steal and certainly knowing that there was an ulterior motive, even if she was a legitimate daughter, but what did it matter?</p>
 <p>In Murong Tai’s eyes, even raising a dog, the dog would've the role of watching the house. And for the one who didn’t have any value to the prime minister, Murong Qi Qi was even inferior to a dog…</p>
 <p>Now, Murong Qi Qi who had been sent to Jing Xin An for five years by Murong Tai, had been back for three days. From the moment she came back till now, Murong Tai had not seen this third daughter. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Murong Tai couldn’t help but carefully observe Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Pale skin.&nbsp; Slender eyebrows. The eyes were not big. The bridge of the nose was not high. The lips were not thin nor thick and the color of the lips was somewhat light. She could only be considered a delicate and normal woman.</p>
 <p>Murong Tai was a handsome man himself and his wife Li Qiu Shui was one of the beauties. His first daughter, the now Imperial Noble Consort Murong Xue Lian, before she had entered the palace, she’d already been given the name of ‘number one beauty of the capital’.&nbsp; Now his second daughter Murong Xin Lian was being called the number one beauty of the capital. His youngest daughter Murong Qing Lian, although she was young, she was already quite pretty. Even his only son was also handsome. Only Murong Qi Qi seemed to not have inherited their strong points. In this family full of beauties, she could only be considered an ordinary and mediocre grass.</p>
 <p>Originally, Murong Tai thought that Murong Qi Qi would change after these five years. After seeing Murong Qi Qi’s looks, the displeasure in his heart welled up again.</p>
 <p>To him, this rubbish daughter was like a mole of a beauty on the tip of her nose, spoiling the landscape. She was also like a fish bone in the throat; couldn’t go down but also couldn’t be spit out, really annoying.</p>
 <p>“Why are you here?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai didn’t have any place to vent his anger. Just at the right moment, he saw Murong Qi Qi to vent his anger.</p>
 <p>“You just came back, the rumors are already flying outside. Really a good thing that you did!”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai didn’t ask for the right or wrong of the matter and just scolded, making Murong Qi Qi feel a lot of ‘grievances’.&nbsp; With Su Yue’s help, Murong Qi Qi cautiously stood at one side. Her head was lowered till her chest and she didn’t say a word. She looked like an innocent little lamb.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, this is the place where little cousin lives. Of course, she should be here.”</p>
 <p>Just as Murong Qi Qi wanted to continue to pretend to be mute, from one side she heard a voice speaking&nbsp;up for her. Listening to it, it was actually Li Yun Qing.</p>
 <p>This person would actually speak up for her? This made Murong Qi Qi very surprised. Although she needed to call Li Yun Qing big cousin brother, but their relationship was just normal. They didn’t get together a lot.</p>
 <p>Seeing Li Yun Qing open his mouth, Murong Tai could only smile: “Oh, yes, here is third little girl's Cui Zhu <em>yuan.”</em>[1. Yuan: a wing/ part of a residence]</p>
 <p>Although Li Yun Qing was Li Qiu Shui’s big brother's&nbsp; son and was a younger generation, Li Yun Qing was the eldest son of Li Kiu, current patriarch of the Li family. In the younger generation, he was considered a talent and also Li family’s future patriarch. Since he had opened his mouth, Murong Tai had to give him face.</p>
 <p>“Hadn’t come here for a long time. I actually didn’t know that little cousin sister lived at such a place.”</p>
 <p>Li Yun Qing looked once around Cui Zhu <em>yuan. </em>This shabby old place, just with one look, you would know that Murong Qi was not treated well at the prime minister's.</p>
 <p>Usually, Li Yun Qing wouldn’t have spoke to help, but just now he was surprised to see a hint of ‘watching a play’ from Murong Qi Qi’s eyes. This little cousin sister seemed to have changed. So he naturally wouldn’t mind to help.</p>
 <p>“As far as I know, little cousin&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">sister</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">just came back! Just coming back and outside, there’s already so many rumors. I think someone is jealous that little cousin sister is about to become Jing </span><em style="font-size: 1.5rem;">wangfei</em><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span><a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>, that’s why they made up those rumors. Uncle, these rumors should have been let out by people of the mansion. I think you should investigate well to see who dared to bully my, Li Yun Qing’s little cousin sister!”</span></span></p>
 <p>Li Yun Qing’s words had three layers of meanings:</p>
 <p>First: Murong Qi Qi had just come back. She didn’t even have a chance to go out. Those rumors were naturally prepared by other people.</p>
 <p>Second: the people who had spread these rumors must be jealous that Murong Qi Qi’s fiancé was Jing <em>wang</em>[3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank]. This was obviously a slander.</p>
 <p>Third: no matter how bad Murong Qi Qi was, her mother is the first wife and Li family’s eldest daughter. Behind her, there was still Li family.</p>
 <p>Murong Tai naturally understood the meaning of Li Yun Qing’s words. He didn’t think that Murong Qi Qi would enter Li Yun Qing’s eyes and to also let him protect her like this.</p>
