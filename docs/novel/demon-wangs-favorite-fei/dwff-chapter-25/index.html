 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter 25: Thousand Snakes Dances</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Sure enough, you are as shameless as what the outside say! Murong Qi Qi, as your big siter, today I’ll teach you what sense of shame is!”</p>
 <p>While her mouth is saying that, the whip in Murong Xin Lian’s hand flew mercilessly towards Murong Qi Qi’s face. Seeing the whip getting closer to Murong Qi Qi’s placid face, Murong Xin Lian’s smile became more and more vicious. Mom, today, daughter will kill this rubbish to avenge you!</p>
 <p>‘Pa……’</p>
 <p>While Murong Xin Lian is dreaming, her face felt pain. A trail of blood under her left eye reached down to the corner of her mouth.</p>
 <p>What?! The whip actually went around a circle and hit her own face! What’s going on? Murong Xin Lian reached for the burning pain on her face with an astonished expression.</p>
 <p>“Aiya!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei covered her mouth and shouted in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Second miss, didn’t think you have masochistic tendencies and likes to whip yourself. Could it be that you like S&amp;M (sadomasochism)? Then your future husband will be really happy, ah!”</p>
 <p>‘S&amp;M’? In Murong Qi Qi’s head, an image immediately appeared of Murong Xin Lian tying up Longze Jing Tian like a rice dumpling. A foot on his back and a whip waving in her hand. Her mouth is shouting ‘call me queen’……</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>Listening to Su Mei being so sarcastic, Murong Xin knows for certain that they have tampered with this whip. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have fallen on her own body.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian once again waved the whip towards Murong Qi Qi. The soft whip is like a snake dancing in the air and heading towards Murong Qi Qi. When the whip is an inch away from Murong Qi Qi, suddenly it’s like it encountered a transparent wall and once again bounced back.</p>
 <p>This time, Murong Xin Lian used more force. The result is also more miserable than before. How much effort she used, all went to her own body.&nbsp; ‘Pa’, once again sounded. On Murong Xin Lian’s right face appeared a whip scar completely symmetrical to the left cheek. Looking at it, it’s like an upside down ‘eight’ (?).</p>
 <p>“Zeze ze, second big sister, didn’t you always really care about your looks? What stimulus did you receive to so ‘not want face’?” (<em>a pun for calling MXL shameless)</em></p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s ‘not want face’ finally incensed Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>“Rubbish, you’re the one who doesn’t want face! The matter of you and Lian <em>gongzi [1. Gongzi: young master]&nbsp;</em>has long spread throughout the capital. I’d like to see how you’ll face people in the future! Why don’t you just die? If you’re afraid to die, I don’t mind giving you a ride!”</p>
 <p>“A…….”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi held her hand out while laughing. Su Yue immediately rubbed her fingers, which were contaminated with juice, clean with a wet tissue. Then she (SY) carefully wiped a white cream evenly on her (MQQ) hand.</p>
 <p>Su Yue’s action made Murong Xin Lian couldn’t help but compare her to her own maids. With just a comparison, she hated Murong Qi Qi even more. She didn’t expect that the people under this rubbish would treat her so well. What can she do or what does she have to let people serve her like this?</p>
 <p>“Second&nbsp;big sister, by comparing, it seems that the person who tried to frame her biological brother and sister doesn’t want face more (<em>is even more shameless)</em>! Or should we put up a stall in the capital to let the people of the capital judge who doesn’t want face more?”</p>
 <p>“You……”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s face became livid.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, everything happened because Murong Qi Qi tampered with them. She (MQQ) has long known her (MXL) plan. So <em>she grafted flowers onto a tree</em>and changed the person into Zheng Min.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Graft flowers onto a tree: substitute one thing for another.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Just thinking about the horrifying way Zheng Min died and the series of consequences that it brought along, Murong Xin Lian wanted to tear Murong Qi Qi into pieces and throw her to feed the dogs. Her mother is gone. The image she maintained is gone. Her good destiny is gone. All of this is because of this damn Murong Qi Qi in front of her!</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, I’ll kill you!”</p>
 <p>The furious Murong Xin Lian couldn’t hold it anymore. She waved the whip towards Murong Qi Qi. Now she isn’t as ‘subtle as before’. She used the inner energy of her body. Her whole body is shrouded in a golden light. This is the symbol of a level three martial artist.</p>
 <p>“Only level three?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi yawned. Su Mei and Su Yue even more didn’t put this into their eyes. Just a small level three and she dared to show arrogance in front of miss? Murong Xin Lian’s head must’ve been struck by lightning!</p>
 <p>In this world, martial arts are split into nine levels. The different colors of the inner energy are to distinguish the levels. Level one to level seven correspond to the colors red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and purple. Level eight is white. The supreme level nine is black.</p>
 <p>Normally, people will cherish their inner energy and won’t easily show it. Even last time, Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian only fought with their hands and feet. Since the after-effects of using the inner energy is a weak body and they need to rest for a long time before recovering. So, unless it’s a duel or to protect his/her own life, otherwise nobody will use it easily under normal circumstances because that’s simply wasting it.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian apparently knew the truth, but she received deep stimulation and exposed the yellow inner energy to kill Murong Qi Qi. Now in her head, there’s only one thought. That’s to kill Murong Qi Qi to avenge Zheng Min.</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian in golden light revealed a bloodthirsty smile. Although she is less than Murong Qing Lian, but she’s still a level three martial artist. Killing a rubbish, is that not an easy thing to do? Murong Xin Lian is completely immersed in her own thoughts and didn’t see the mockery in Su Mei and Su Yue’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Thousand snake dance!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s body is shrouded by a dancing whip. This is her ability to kill. Murong Xin Lian is sure, just this one attack will be able to remove Murong Qi Qi’s ‘dog head’. She is confident in this killer move like how she is confident in her looks.</p>
 <p>“Child’s play……”</p>
 <p>Seeing that poop has entered Murong Xin Lian’s head, Su Mei has already take a long jump. Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to open her mouth, she directly stands in front of Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Miss, this slave hasn’t used my muscles and bones for a long time. Can you do<em>nubi </em>a favor and reward this opportunity to this slave?!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the bright eyes on Su Mei’s oval face are full of playful desire, Murong Qi Qi poked her forehead while smiling: “Alright! Remember, don’t hurt my flower jade-like second big sister……”</p>
 <p>“Yes miss, this slave will surely take care of her,” Su Mei said while smiling.</p>
 <p>“Go die!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi ‘push’ Su Mei forward as the ‘scapegoat’, Murong Xin Lian smiled viciously.</p>
 <p>“You want to die? This miss will help you accomplish it!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian has long thought well of it. If one comes, she’ll kill a pair. If two comes, she’ll kill two pairs. Today, she is determined to take Murong Qi Qi’s head. It’s the best if these two maids are also solved!</p>
 <p>In the air, a snake is dancing. Murong Xin Lian incarnated golden arrows that headed straight to Su Mei’s face. The silver whip immediately turned into a sharp weapon as if it wants to devour this little maid.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei sneered. On that small oval face, the almond eyes sparkled. She stood straight. She doesn’t move even with the wind, as if she doesn’t fear the arrogant Murong Xin Lian.</p>
