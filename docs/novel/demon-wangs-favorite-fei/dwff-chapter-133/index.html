 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 133 I love you (1)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>In the middle of the night, Murong Qi Qi’s crisp as silver bell- like laughter was particularly refreshing in the silent Lion Ridge.</p>
 <p>The beauty’s laughter was capable of causing the downfall of a city or state. Looking at the bright and dazzling woman in front of them, the people in black couldn’t help but envy their master’s good fortune form the bottom of their hearts. Originally, they were worried that because of this matter, Feng Cang would suffer at mistress’s hands. They didn’t expect that this laughter from mistress, would let the earth become pale in comparison.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing…,” Feng Cang’s handsome face was somewhat hot. Murong Qi Qi’s attitude was too beyond his imaginations. Just as Feng Cang still wasn’t sure if Murong Qi Qi truly wasn’t angry, the other party came with cat’s steps and jumped into Feng Cang’s arms.</p>
 <p>“You care about me, I am very happy!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi lay in Feng Cang’s arms. She raised her head and looked in his eyes, “Really! You care so much about me, I’m particularly moved!”</p>
 <p>Now, those people who prayed for Feng Cang were completely assured.</p>
 <p>“Oh!” Someone clapped. More people cheered for Feng Cang and were happy because he found such a reasonable person.</p>
 <p>The laughter was strong in these people in black who were utterly defeated by Murong Qi Qi. Naturally, they wished for their master to be happy. To be able to find such an intimate and such a powerful mistress was something everyone looked for a very long time forward to.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, you don’t blame me?”</p>
 <p>“Fool!” In order to reassure this person, in front of everyone, Murong Qi Qi tiptoed, her hands went around Feng Cang’s neck and sent him a warm kiss.</p>
 <p>“Mistress is formidable!”</p>
 <p>Such a hot scene let those men scream.</p>
 <p>“Hehe…” This kiss let Feng Cang’s heart eased down completely. She's his. He felt it! “Qing Qing, I love you!” Feng Cang lowered his head and kissed Murong Qi Qi’s lips.</p>
 <p>“Oh…”</p>
 <p>It was rare to see such a wonderful picture. Everyone polished their eyes and stared at that pair of lovers; one in red, one in white. They kissed like the world was shaking as if in this world, there were only the two of them…</p>
 <p>Kissing to the end, Feng Cang lowered his body and picked Murong Qi Qi up. He left as fast as the wind.</p>
 <p>“Miss…,” Su Yue was just about to follow, when she was stopped by Nalan Xin. “<em>Wangye </em>[1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank] and <em>wangfei</em>[2. Wangfei: main consort/wife of the prince of first rank] have something to do. We shouldn’t bother them! The most important thing now is to check how Wu Ji Gong’s people hooked on the people from the court. The matter of Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai still needs to be resolved. For an estimate short time, master wouldn’t have time to care about this…”</p>
 <p>Nalan Xin saying this, Su Yue’s face turned red. Looking at the situation, miss and <em>guye</em>[3. Guye: son-in-law, used by the servants of the female family] must’ve gone to a world with only the two of them. Su Mei also had a red face. Instead it was Fang Tong who laughed. “It seemed that we should prepare sooner. Firstly, resolve these trivial matters. Then, we must prepare for the arrival of young master!”</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough…”</p>
 <p>Nalan Xin felt that he was subtle enough. He didn’t expect that Fang Tong, this elder, would be so direct. The couple just went to be affectionate and this elder directly thought about the next generation.</p>
 <p>The thought that he kidnapped Fang Tong to here today, Nalan Xin quickly came forward to apologize, “Elder Fang, this younger one lacked manners today. Asking elder to let this younger one atone for my crime.”</p>
 <p>“Haha!” Fang Tong laughed and waved his hand. Before, he also misunderstood Feng Cang. Only after he encountered Su Mei and Su Yue, did he understand the matter. Seeing Feng Cang cared so much for Murong Qi Qi, of course, Fang Tong was happy.</p>
 <p>“There would always be talented people coming out of this world. Brat, you’re not bad! Your martial arts are great, ah! Today we’re <em>surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple</em>, our own people didn’t recognize our own people. Now the contradictions are untied. It’s nothing!” While talking, Fang Tong’s big hand patted on Nalan Xin’s shoulder. It could be regarded as his (FT) affirmation towards him (NX)</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Surging waters flooded the Dragon King Temple: a dispute between close people who fail to recognize each other</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Fang Tong saying this made Nalan Xin felt that Moyu’s people were very interesting. People of the <em>jianghu </em>[4. Jianghu: world of martial arts] didn’t bother about trifles.</p>
 <p>Although Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi weren’t here, but Nalan Xin and Fang Tong’s point of view was the same on the matter of dealing with Wu Ji Gong.</p>
 <p>“Elder Fang, you see, this was our fault. Why don’t you let us deal with Wu Ji Gong’s matter? It could be considered as an apology to <em>wangfei</em> and also an explanation for Moyu.”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong nodded at Nalan Xin’s opinion, “Originally, this matter should be decided by miss. Now, since young master Nalan said it like this, then do according to your wishes! Elder, me, had long seen Wu Ji Gong as a thorn in the eyes. In my opinion, it’s the best to wipe them out at once! Lest to let them come disturb and let miss and <em>guye </em>worry!”</p>
 <p>What Fang Tong said was what Nalan Xin thought about. Although, he didn’t know why Wu Ji Gong would make trouble for Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>,[5. Gongzi: young master] but they even pulled the army in. Then it would have something to do with the court.</p>
 <p>Wu Ji Gong had always been the running dogs of the crown prince. Maybe this matter had something to do with the crown prince. Anyway, regardless of the consequences, destroy them first.</p>
 <p>He had long not liked Wanyan Hong! Free or not free, he (WH) would bother <em>wangye</em>. This time, he even burned <em>wangfei’s </em>Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai. It’s said, what can’t be tolerated shouldn’t be tolerated! Offending <em>wangye </em>is a small matter. Causing him (NX) to leave a bad impression at <em>wangfei’s </em>was something that even heaven’s law wouldn’t tolerate!</p>
 <p>At this end, Nalan Xin was planning how to end Wu Ji Gong. At the other side of Lion Ridge, Feng Cang&nbsp; grabbed Murong Qi Qi’s chin and deeply looked at the little woman in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, I was bitterly being kept in the dark by you…”A long sigh evaporated all the vinegar of Feng Cang from these past few days, leaving only a thick love and a slight blame.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t do it on purpose. Besides, you also kept a secret from me…”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Feng Cang to speak, Murong Qi Qi seized Feng Cang’s hand. She turned and sat in a riding position on Feng Cang’s body, “Cang…” Learning from Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi also grabbed Feng Cang’s chin. Her fingertips gently touched Feng Cang’s thin beard stubble. Her eyes were smiling, but they had a temptation in them.</p>
 <p>“Cang has something you hid from me…You kept talking about my wrongdoings. Why did you have questions and didn’t come ask me directly? I kept it from you, then why weren’t you forthcoming with me?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s questions made Feng Cang laugh helplessly. Just now, he was thinking that Murong Qi Qi wouldn’t hold someone accountable for today’s matter. In front of everyone, she took the initiative to kiss him and gave him enough face. Feng Cang thought that today’s matter vanished with that affectionate kiss.</p>
 <p>He didn’t expect that Murong Qi Qi’s move was here. She was waiting to settle the scores at an opportune moment and to send punitive forces against him in private. This little woman knew very well that men wanted face….</p>
 <p>“Cang, who are you? Seeing your position, I think you’re not so simple as being only Nan Lin <em>wang</em>!”</p>
 <p>While Murong Qi Qi was speaking, her fingertips made circles on Feng Cang’s chin. It was as if her hands had magic. Where they touched, they bought Feng Cang a numb feeling. From his chin, that feeling extended and finally conveyed to his whole body.</p>
 <p>Could it be that this woman didn’t know what she was doing?! Feng Cang swallowed. Her hand lit him like fire, making his heart and his body began to stir.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang grasped Murong Qi Qi’s restless hand. His eyes were exceptionally brightly lit under the candle, “Qing Qing, talking about it, our fate wasn’t shallow. &nbsp;I’m the leader of Fo Sheng Men...Long Ao Tian!”</p>
 <p>The story began five years ago, when Feng Cang’s poison acted and met Mozun. She heard that godfather promised her to Feng Cang. Murong Qi Qi laughed and put her arms on Feng Cang’s waist. “So, our fate was destined! Father and mother wanted to promise me to you. Godfather also took a fancy on you. Now, even I, the involved party was also made so infatuated with you. A predestined marriage concluded by three fates.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words made Feng Cang happy. A predestined marriage concluded by three fates? This was well said! Their fate was actually already firmly tied together from a long time ago. It seemed that this small lazy cate was destined to be his!</p>
 <p>“Say, how would you compensate me for today’s matter?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi crossed her arms over her chest and pretended to look angrily at Feng Cang, “We fought internally, let people think we’re a joke and also let those bastard from Wu Ji Gong find a loophole; destroying my efforts. You say, how should you compensate me?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi kept repeating ‘compensation’ made Feng Cang think about Wu Ji Gong that participated in this matter. Usually, he turned a blind eye. This time, Wu Ji Gong actually wanted to touch his woman? This matter absolutely couldn’t be forgiven!</p>
 <p>“Servants!” Feng Cang’s voice echoed. A person in black appeared in front of them, “Master!” The person in black knelt on one knee. His whole body revealed his respect towards Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“Destroy Wu Ji Gong.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” The person in black was about to leave, but was stopped by Murong Qi Qi, “Take my people. Take Su Yue. Tell her that Wu Ji Gong destroyed my things. Even if skinning their skin, they need to compensate my loss.”</p>
 <p>The person in black didn’t move. He just looked at Feng Cang. Feng Cang is his master. This matter needed master’s nod.</p>
 <p>“Go! Let Nalan Xin take care of this matter and convey <em>wangfei’s w</em>ords! Tell Nalan Xin to take care of this beautifully as to make up for his earlier mistake!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>When Nalan Xin heard the meaning Feng Cang let the person in black convey, he was completely speechless. What kind of black-bellied master is this, ah?! He (FC) did the wrong thing himself and now he let him (NX) who only run the errands go ‘make up for his earlier mistake’! Wanting to make <em>wangfei </em>happy, no need to single him out as the point of attack, ah!</p>
 <p>Nalan Xin felt like weeping, but had no tears. This was Feng Cang’s command. He could only successfully complete it.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Where would Feng Cang have the time to care about Nalan Xin’s thoughts now. He repeatedly said ‘Qing Qing’ to coax Murong Qi Qi into happiness.</p>
 <p>It was said that women needed to be coaxed. Feng Cang admitted that he was indeed wrong on this matter. If he had listened to Nalan Xin sooner and talked frankly with Murong Qi Qi, this misunderstanding wouldn’t have continued for so long. He also wouldn’t lose his reason and eat vinegar for so long.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, look, you already beat and kicked. Now, my chest is still hurting! If you don’t believe me, then touch!” Feng Cang grabbed Murong Qi Qi’s small hand and put it on his heart, “Today I finally got to know that Qing Qing’s usual gentleness and pleasantness were all a pretense. It turned out that when Qing Qing flipped out, Qing Qing would be so violent…”</p>
 <p>Only after Feng Cang said this, did Murong Qi Qi remember. Before, she flew into a rage out of humiliation. Not only did she give him a slap but also fiercely kicked Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I didn’t know it was you! Are you alright?! Does it hurt? Let me take a look!” Murong Qi Qi didn’t think much and directly pried the clothes on Feng Cang’s chest open. Sure enough, on his white like jade skin was a red footprint.</p>
 <p>Seeing this shoeprint, Murong Qi Qi blushed. She had forgotten how powerful her flying kick was. Especially at that time, Feng Cang already let his guard down. This kick certainly hurt him.</p>
 <p>The red footprint on Feng Cang’s milk white skin was especially offending to the eyes as if it was complaining about Murong Qi Qi’s barbarian ways. After seeing her achievement, the original right and self-confident Murong Qi Qi became sickly.</p>
 <p>“Who told you to have nothing to do and lowered your voice. I couldn’t recognize your voice. I saw you in white clothes and in disarray like a cow, I got angry. Besides, you kept touching, I thought I encountered a pervert…”</p>
 <p>The more she talked, the smaller Murong Qi Qi’s voice became. She searched on her body, wanting to find a cream for Feng Cang to lessen the swelling. After searching for half&nbsp; day, did Murong Qi Qi remember that she changed just now. She didn’t bring those creams. Looking at the redness on Feng Cang’s chest, Murong Qi Qi’s face became redder.</p>
 <p>“Should we go back! My creams are at <em>wangfu</em>. I assure you, as long as you apply my creams, it wouldn’t even take a half day before the redness and swelling would be eliminated. After a day, it wouldn’t hurt anymore!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi wanted to get up, but had been locked in Feng Cang’s arms, “Don’t move!” Feng Cang’s face was slightly red. When this little woman examined his ‘injury’, Feng Cang had an unprecedented impulse of wanting to jump on Murong Qi Qi and punish her on spot.</p>
 <p>Could this woman not know that she, a sheep, to him, this wolf, was a delicacy?! She pried his clothes open. Did she not understand that to a man that was undoubtedly a very great temptation?</p>
 <p>“Cang? What’s the matter?” Seeing Feng Cang being so red, Murong Qi Qi reached out her hand and waved in front of his eyes, “What’s the matter? Does it hurt very much? I’m sorry! I really didn’t know it was you…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s eyes were full of guilt, but Feng Cang was ‘unwilling to forgive’.&nbsp; “Qing Qing really has a ruthless heart! Obviously, you want to murder your husband! You definitely have someone else in your heart. So, you want to take my life and elope with another…”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t, I didn’t!” Hearing Feng Cang say this, Murong Qi Qi immediately shook her head. “I really didn’t do it on purpose! I didn’t recognize you! I don’t like someone else aside from you touching me. That was why, that kick was so fierce!”</p>
 <p>Hearing that ‘I don’t like someone else touching me’, Feng Cang’s beautiful eyes filled with laughter. So, it was like that!&nbsp; She took herself as his private ownership. That was why she would be like that. She was protecting him, ah!</p>
 <p>However, although, he was touched, Feng Cang didn’t plan on ‘letting’ Murong Qi Qi ‘off the hook’.&nbsp; Finally, he caught the opportunity to eat the lamb. How would he give up on the delicacy presented to his mouth?!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Feng Cang frowned and clutched his heart. He pretended to be in much pain and began to moan, “Just now, we didn’t talk about it and I didn’t feel it. Now, here really hurt! Qing Qing, my chest hurts very much. You say, am I dying?”</p>
 <p>“No!” Feng Cang saying this, Murong Qi Qi became anxious. She immediately put her hand on Feng Cang’s wrist to check his pulse. After not finding anything strange, Murong Qi Qi was relieved. She was just about to speak, when Feng Cang’s voice with a hidden bitterness came over, “But, my chest hurt so much. What to do? Why don’t you blow on it for me. It won’t hurt anymore if you blow on it…”</p>
 <p>“Blow…” Murong Qi Qi froze there. Where did this principle come from? After being wounded, ‘blow’ on it and it would be fine?</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi had doubts, Feng Cang pretended to grimace in pain, “Qing Qing, it really hurts!”</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, I’ll blow on it for you!” Murong Qi Qi’s small face came to Feng Cang’s chest. Her small mouth opened slightly and blew out a warm heat. That warm air lingered for a long time on Feng Cang’s chest. It didn’t dissipate yet, when the next warm air hit again.</p>
 <p>An electric shock spread from Feng Cang’s chest.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi had her head lowered and blew on Feng Cang’s chest. Seeing Murong Qi Qi’s serious expression, Feng Cang suddenly had a sense of guilt. He felt like he was a big bad wolf deceiving a small lamb. However, this small lamb was so fresh and delicious, making him couldn’t wait to get a taste. What should he do?</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing…” Feng Cang didn’t realize that his original magnetic voice had become a bit hoarse. His throat was dry and his voice was somewhat trembling.</p>
 <p>“Mm?” Murong Qi Qi raised her head. A pair of moist eyes was very thorough and with some anxiousness. This kick kicked Feng Cang’s chest, but hurt Murong Qi Qi’s heart. Feng Cang’s body was originally not so well; this kick was too powerful!</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, if you kiss it, perhaps it won’t hurt anymore.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Feng Cang wished he could give himself two slaps. Shameless, ah! Too shameless! Shouldn’t abduct a small sheep like this! Wasn’t this committing a crime?! Since when did he become like a rogue? Really somewhat unscrupulous!</p>
 <p>The Murong Qi Qi who felt for Feng Cang didn’t notice the strangeness in Feng Cang. Instead, she truly put her lips on the red print.</p>
 <p>“Goo…” Feng Cang closed his eyes. This time, he knew he was wrong! He didn’t know that to him, Murong Qi Qi’s kiss was a fatal torture!</p>
 <p>Did this woman not doubt his ulterior motives? Her soft lips were on his chest and slowly moved around the injury. Without a doubt, this was a test to him; a torture! Just now, it was only a numb feeling. Now, Feng Cang’s body couldn’t help but tremble slightly. Damn it! If he had known sooner, he wouldn’t trick the small lamb. Now, the one who was feeling the most painful became him….</p>
 <p>“Cang, what’s the matter?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi soon discovered Feng Cang’s strangeness. “Why is it like this?” Murong Qi Qi put her hand on Feng Cang’s forehead.&nbsp; “This won’t do. We need to return to the <em>wangfu</em>![6. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first rank] I certainly wounded you!”</p>
 <p>There was a saying, concern would cause chaos. Murong Qi Qi had high medical skills. Originally, with one look, she could see the trickery inside this. However, now her heart was full of guilt and ignored Feng Cang’s gaze full of sexual desire.</p>
 <p>“Servants!” Murong Qi Qi stood up, but had been grasped by Feng Cang. He pressed her under his body.</p>
