 <p>New year special. Happy new year :) May this year be better than last year.</p>
 <p>Chapter 74 The enemy (2)</p>
 <p>When Feng Cang mentioned Shangguan Wu Ji, Murong Qi Qi immediately softly made a ‘pooh’ sound. Although Shangguan Wu Ji’s task was to safely escort her to Bei Zhou to marry, but because the marriage had been blocked by the empress dowager, his mission had not been completed&nbsp;yet, so he could only wait at the house of the embassy.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Wu Ji repeatedly came to Nan Lin <em>wangfu</em>[1. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first rank] to see Murong Qi Qi, but every time, he was&nbsp;stopped by housekeeper Feng Qi. He always used the excuse ‘my family’s <em>wangye</em>[2. Wang/ Wangye: the prince of first rank] is nurturing feelings with <em>wangfei</em>[3. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank]’, literally making that handsome face of Shangguan Wu Ji so red that it could drop blood.</p>
 <p>Of course, such cheesy words were also instructed by Feng Cang. His purpose was to let Shangguan Wu Ji give up. Murong Qi Qi was his, how could he let other people covet her?!</p>
 <p>However, it looked like that this young general was somewhat stubborn. He still came every day to <em>wangfu</em> to ‘pay his respect to princess’. Even when he got the cold shoulder and also heard a lot of stories about how good the relationship between Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi is, but he still insisted on seeing Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang was not afraid of stubbornness!</p>
 <p>Now, he saw Shangguan Wu Ji’s earnestness as a war between them. He was a young god of war. Now that the world was at peace, he had nothing to do, but defending was also his expertise. Guard Murong Qi Qi inside this capital; swat all the other people who want to covet her was the most important thing right now.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye </em>saying it like that is not right! I’m a particularly unusual person. I like mature men! ‘Old men’ are chewy with toughness and also can exercise one’s teeth! Getting three birds with one stone. How can the young I not like ‘old men’?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi saying it so seriously amused Feng Cang. He laughed out loud. He took Murong Qi Qi into his arms. His chin gently dawdled on her forehead. This little woman, ever since she had opened her heart, her personality became livelier.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, I also like to eat such fresh and tender grass like you. It’s a good taste for the mouth. There’s enough moisture. Besides, my teeth is not good. There’s no need to chew tender grass, only need to swallow it……”</p>
 <p>“So, <em>wangye </em>and I are a perfect match?”</p>
 <p>Although Murong Qi Qi’s cheeks were red, but the words coming from her mouth were a lot bolder.</p>
 <p>“Of course! Could it be that you’ve forgotten that you came to this world with only the mission to become my <em>wangfei?</em>”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang saying that made Murong Qi Qi’s face go completely red. Originally, she wanted to compete with Feng Cang to see whose face was ‘thicker’. She didn’t expect that after the numerous confrontations of the past few days, ultimately, she would be defeated by Feng Cang. She really was not able to say words that were more cheesy than that…….</p>
 <p>These two flirted like there was no one around them, making Ru Yi and Su Yue who were also in the room get red faces. While serving their masters, their ears feverishly listened to their flirtation.</p>
 <p>Such scenes happened for five days already. Although they didn’t know what happened that day at the banquet, but everyone could feel that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi’s relationship had reached a new level. The two often had some intimate action or said some love words which were able to sweeten people to death, making they, the servants, feel very embarrassed.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of Su Yue and the others' embarrassment, but this pair have become addicted to sweetness. Everywhere in <em>wangfu,&nbsp;</em>Feng Cang’s laughter could be heard. This was the first time it ever happened in these past ten years, which made the servants of the residence, when they had nothing to do, gather outside of Tingsong Building to watch. They wanted to know what ability this new <em>wangfei</em> had to make <em>wangye</em> so happy.</p>
 <p>For a time, the outside of Tingsong Building became the liveliest place of Nan Lin <em>wangfu</em>. Everyone wanted to see this new <em>wangfei</em>’s elegant bearing.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Feng Cang, this <em>wangye’s </em>possessiveness was too strong. He never allowed Murong Qi Qi to leave his side for even half a step. Even when going out, he would put a veil on her. So, this princess from Xi Qi became a mystery. And talk about this mysterious princess was spread to the outsiders by the people of <em>wangfu</em>. She also became the hottest topic of recent discussion in the capital.</p>
 <p>Since the welcoming banquet, the empress dowager didn’t continue to make things difficult for Murong Qi Qi. However, didn’t know who spread the word about the bet; now all the streets of the capital were rumoring about this matter. There were even gambling dens which opened bets; betting if Bei Zhou can or cannot win, betting on if Murong Qi Qi can successfully become the new <em>wangfei</em>.</p>
 <p>From the moment Bei Zhou was founded till now, Bei Zhou hadn’t win for four consecutive tournaments. Not to mention the last time; Bei Zhou came last among the four countries. Could this time, because of a princess who came to form a marriage alliance, be a turning point? Can that even happen?</p>
 <p>In many people’s hearts, the answer to this question was negative. No matter how mysterious Murong Qi Qi was, it didn’t change the fact that she was a ‘rubbish’. Regardless of how outstanding Feng Cang, this Nan Lin <em>wang </em>was, it also couldn’t change the fact that his eight wives had all died.</p>
 <p>Similarly, no matter how strong Bei Zhou was, it also couldn’t change the fact that this country didn’t have any top experts. Although this was a contest between young people, but from the ability of the young people, the new strength of a country could be seen. This was a fact everyone understood. Almost everyone put their bet on the side of that Murong Qi Qi would lose, on the side that Bei Zhou would lose.</p>
 <p>Although the citizens loved their country, and they all wished for Bei Zhou to get the first place, but the truth was put in front of them. Besides, this matter was related to the silver in their purse. So, in the end they chose their most truthful thought.</p>
 <p>However, there were always exceptions. When Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>[4. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer a famous man]&nbsp;bet five million silver teals that Bei Zhou would certainly win, all of Bei Zhou was in an uproar.</p>
 <p>Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>? What kind of character was he? In this vast land, as long as there’s women, there would be people who knew about Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>. If the times were more open and women could have fantasies, Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>would&nbsp;definitely be the first fantasy of women.</p>
 <p>Never was there a man who understood the needs and desire for beauty of a woman and could express it through jewelry and clothing. The women of this world, no matter if they were noble or humble, no matter if they were beautiful or ugly, as long as they were a woman, they would have a heart which loved beauty. And Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>fulfilled their wish.</p>
 <p>For women, even if they couldn’t afford those expensive jewelry and clothing, but as long as they could take a glance, even if the next moment they die, they would be willing.</p>
 <p>Now Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>was actually betting that Murong Qi Qi would win, making everyone's eyes couldn’t help but gather at Nan Lin <em>wangfu</em>.</p>
 <p>No one had ever seen Guanghua <em>gongzi, </em>that’s why people rumored him to be so marvelous. There were some who say he's a prince of a country. Others say that he was a young master of a great family. There were also some who say he's the descendant of a mysterious clan. In short, a variety of bizarre identities had been put on him.</p>
 <p>And such a mysterious Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>&nbsp;had placed a bet of five million on Murong Qi Qi. There seemed to be an ulterior motive behind it.</p>
 <p>While everyone was thinking about how Nan Lin <em>wang</em> Feng Cang would guess Murong Qi Qi and Guanghua <em>gongzi's&nbsp;</em>relationship, how Nan Lin <em>wangfu </em>would now be in a mess, another mysterious person placed a ten million bet on Bei Zhou winning the tournament.</p>
 <p>This time, Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>was defeated. The other party didn’t leave any trace of information, which resulted in a variety of speculation. There were even people who suspected that this person was the emperor of Bei Zhou Wanyan Lie. The emperor saw that his own citizens were betting that Bei Zhou would lose, his heart was uncomfortable and he also lost face. So, he bet ten million to buy back a face.</p>
 <p>However, all speculations were fleeting. The rumors intensified, but the truth was known to no one. The famous person from the rumors, Murong Qi Qi, with the help of Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>and the mysterious person, in one shot became the person Bei Zhou paid most attention to. These happenings didn’t affect Murong Qi Qi’s daily life, but it let some other women hate till their face became distorted.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Bastard! Bastard!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu kicked the stool. Angry, she smashed all the porcelain onto the ground. Originally, she wanted to see Murong Qi Qi become a joke, she didn’t expect that two men would appear, disturbing her mood of watching a play.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>“Princess, don’t be angry!”</p>
 <p>Yong <em>er</em>[5. Er: term of endearment] quickly caught the porcelain vase from Wanyan Bao Zhu’s hand and let people put it to one side. She helped Wanyan Bao Zhu sit down.</p>
 <p>“Princess, don’t anger your body because of a slut. You are too noble, ah! If your body gets sick because of anger, it’s you who will feel pain and the enemy will feel happiness. Besides, it’s almost time for the tournament. Didn’t you also want to show yourself at the tournament?! You can’t get sick, ah!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong</em>[6. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family]&nbsp;is not satisfied!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu bit her lips. Two tears rolled from her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Go, go call Chou <em>er </em>over. Didn’t she say that she has a way to deal with Murong Qi Qi? Call her over.”</p>
 <p>Yong <em>er </em>brought Chou <em>er </em>over. She was a woman who wore&nbsp;a veil that only revealed her eyes. Even though only her eyes could be seen, but that pair of eyes was so beautiful that it could touch people.</p>
 <p>“This slave&nbsp;Chou <em>er</em> greets princess!”</p>
 <p>“You can get up!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu gestured with her hand to let other people retreat. She only let Yong <em>er</em> and Chou<em> er </em>stay.</p>
 <p>“That day when&nbsp;<em>bengong </em>saved you, you said you were Xi Qi’s citizen, is that right?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. This slave is Xi Qi’s citizen.”</p>
 <p>“You’re Xi Qi’s citizen. Then tell <em>bengong </em>the origin of your relationship with Murong Qi Qi.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>When Murong Qi Qi was mentioned, in Chou <em>er</em>’s eyes were hatred and also ice-cold intention to murder. Even Yong <em>er</em> at one side felt afraid. Chou <em>er</em> spent an hour talking about her and Murong Qi Qi’s relationship. Hearing Chou <em>er’s </em>words, Wanyan Bao Zhu looked at her thoughtfully. She believed some parts, but didn’t believe the whole story.</p>
 <p>“Chou <em>er</em>, since you say that Murong Qi Qi is jealous of your beauty and ruined your face, then drop your veil. Let <em>bengong</em> take a look at your face.”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s words made Chou <em>er</em> shiver a bit. She took a deep breath and slowly untied the veil on her face.</p>
 <p>Just one look, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t help but breathe deeply. What kind of hideous face was that, ah?! It’s covered with small, large, round and flat scars. It’s like someone cooked beans and laid it out on Chou <em>er’s </em>face.</p>
 <p>And because the injury on her left face was too deep, the wound was infected. Because there wasn’t any timely treatment, it had began to rot and on it grew new skin. Red scars against the white skin and those withered yellow scars ruined a pretty face completely.</p>
 <p>“How did she give you those scars?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu covered her mouth and her brow frowned. She gestured for Chou <em>er</em> to put the veil back on.</p>
 <p>“Spraying with hot oil.”</p>
 <p>Just four simple words was able to let people see the cruel situation at that time.</p>
 <p>So, Murong Qi Qi did all of these! Wanyan Bao Zhu was shocked. She didn’t expect that the woman who looked so weak would have such vicious means. Just because the man she liked looked once at this Chou <em>er</em>; just because Chou <em>er</em> was more beautiful than her, she did such a cruel thing! How could such vicious woman stay at Cang <em>gege’s</em>[7. Gege: big brother]&nbsp;side!</p>
 <p>Just thinking about her Ning <em>er</em>&nbsp;dying because of Murong Qi Qi made Wanyan Bao Zhu become furious.</p>
 <p>“Chou<em> er,</em> come with <em>bengong</em>! <em>Bengong </em>will take you to Nan Lin <em>wangfu</em>&nbsp;and let you confront Murong Qi Qi in person. <em>Bengong</em>&nbsp;will let you have justice and also let Nan Lin <em>wang </em>see how ugly Murong Qi Qi is, let him see her true face!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu slammed the table, stood up and immediately wanted to go, but Chou <em>er</em> clung onto her legs and begged, “Princess, this slave knows that you are doing it for this slave. This slave is very grateful towards you, but if you go now like this, not only will you bring calamity to this slave, but also bring calamity to yourself, ah! Now Murong Qi Qi has Nan Lin <em>wang’s </em>love. Even if you say it, Nan Lin <em>wang </em>may not let it enter his ears, let alone such a humble and small person like this slave!”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er’s </em>words made sense, making Wanyan Bao Zhu stop in her tracks. Just in a moment, she thought of another way.</p>
 <p>“Since that doesn’t work, then <em>bengong </em>will go with you to the censor! We’ll go find emperor father! He will certainly get justice for you!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s words let Chou <em>er</em> laughed once bitterly. She continued to kowtow: “Princess is kind, believes in this slave's words and is willing to get justice for this slave. However, Murong Qi Qi is Xi Qi’s princess who came to form a marriage alliance. Her status is noble. Even if she kills one or two slaves, it’s just normal. Although emperor is wise, but Nan Lin <em>wang </em>is emperor’s nephew and loves him dearly. So naturally, he (WL) will love everything about and around him (FC). How will he, because of a slave from Xi Qi, go investigate Murong Qi Qi’s wrongdoing?!”</p>
 <p>“This is just a trifle matter. It won’t be able to take Murong Qi Qi down in one shot. Instead, it’ll implicate princess and harm the relation between you and Nan Lin <em>wang. </em>Such a thing naturally cannot happen. Asking princess to reconsider!”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er</em> was crying, full of grief. Her words also pointed out the crucial factors, making Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t help but stop in her tracks once again and think about what she had said.</p>
 <p>Indeed, the whole capital knew about the love Feng Cang had for Murong Qi Qi. At this time, it’s unlikely that Feng Cang would abandon Murong Qi Qi because of a slave. If she can’t take Murong Qi Qi down in one stroke, and get bitten instead by her (MQQ), then wouldn’t her image in Cang <em>gege</em>’s heart be completely destroyed?!</p>
 <p>It’s just that not being able to do anything, her heart felt like something was blocking it.</p>
 <p>Obviously, she knew that woman (MQQ) had a poisonous heart, incomparably vicious, but she wasn’t able to say anything and also couldn't do anything. She would have to see her in Feng Cang's arms and later become Feng Cang’s bride. How could Wanyan Bao Zhu accept this?</p>
 <p>“Can’t do this, can’t do that. Then you say, what should <em>bengong </em>do?!”</p>
 <p>“Princess!”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er</em> once again bowed in front of Wanyan Bao Zhu. Her mottled forehead knocked hard on the ground.</p>
 <p>“If princess really cares about this slave, asking princess to let this slave serve at princess’s side! As the saying goes, not bearing the small matter will ruin the big matter. Murong Qi Qi acts very well. If you don’t have any evidence, you can’t do anything to her. Since it’s like this, we can only wait for the right time.”</p>
 <p>“Although this slave doesn’t have any ability, but the hatred towards Murong Qi Qi is the same as princess’s. This slave only asks to stay at princess’s side, <em>work like a horse and an ox</em>, serve princess and wait for the right opportunity! This slave's hatred towards Murong Qi Qi will let us unable to live under the same sky. One day,&nbsp;this slave will step on Murong Qi Qi’s head and let her regret for her past!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Work like a horse and an ox: work extremely hard. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Looking at Chou <em>er’s </em>expression, Wanyan Bao Zhu pondered for a while. Eventually, she nodded: “Alright! It so happens that <em>bengong’s </em>side needs a personal maid. You can take that place. However, didn’t you say before that you have a way to deal with Murong Qi Qi? How come now it became 'wait for the right time'?”</p>
 <p>To be able to stay, Chou <em>er</em> let out a breath of relief in her head. To Wanyan Bao Zhu’s question, Chou <em>er</em> quickly and cautiously answered.</p>
 <p>“Answering princess, soon it’ll be the tournament between the four countries. This slave heard that the empress dowager is very dissatisfied with Murong Qi Qi. Because of Nan Lin <em>wang’s </em>resolution, she was forced to make a bet with Murong Qi Qi. The bet is the first place of the tournament of the four countries. Therefore, this tournament of the four countries is our opportunity.”</p>
 <p>“As long as we obstruct in secret, don’t let Bei Zhou win, then Murong Qi Qi won’t be able to become Nan Lin <em>wangfei</em>. A princess to form a marriage alliance, but the marriage alliance is unsuccessful, it’s like a slap in her face, ah!”</p>
 <p>As she talked excitedly, inside Chou <em>er’s </em>eyes flashed a strange light, making Wanyan Bao Zhu startle for a moment. Her face was already ruined like this, but her eyes were still so beautiful. Although it was currently being blinded by hatred and contaminated turbid, but the original beauty of that pair of eyes didn’t lessen much. It seemed that in the past, this person was certainly a beauty! Now, Wanyan Bao Zhu believed Chou <em>er </em>a bit more.</p>
 <p>“And after that?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Chou <em>er</em> talking with so much excitement, Wanyan Bao Zhu’s mood also became better as if she was already able to see the tragic appearance of Murong Qi Qi as she was driven out of the palace. She couldn’t help but want to see what would happen next.</p>
 <p>“Originally, her title of princess was just bestowed. Now that her marriage is being cancelled by Bei Zhou’s imperial family, because of face, Xi Qi won’t accept her back. By then, she doesn’t have the back of Xi Qi and also doesn’t have the identity of princess, Murong Qi Qi is just a trivial woman. By then, wouldn’t princess be able to dispose of her any way you want?!”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er’s v</em>oice seemed to have magic in it, making Wanyan Bao Zhu be in a very good mood. Just now, her face was like dark clouds, now even a thousand of miles away, it’s a clear sky as if the day Murong Qi Qi would fall was just around the corner and the position of Nan Lin <em>wangfei </em>was now hers.</p>
 <p>“Chou <em>er</em>, what you said is very right! How come at <em>bengong’s </em>side, there’s no one as clever as you?! Say, when <em>bengong </em>catch Murong Qi Qi, how should <em>bengong </em>torment her? Cut her head or pull out her tongue? That’s right, <em>bengong </em>will first pull out her tongue, then ruin her face. When she is begging pitifully, then cut her throat!”</p>
 <p>The more Wanyan Bao Zhu talks, the more excited she got. She even took out a dagger and gestured at the sky.</p>
 <p>“Princess, to a woman, destroying her reputation will let living be more painful than death. There are so many beggars in Yanjing capital. Why don’t you find some who didn’t get to taste <em>meat </em>for quite a while and reward Murong Qi Qi to them? Let them get the taste of a princess who came to form a marriage alliance.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Meat doesn’t mean meat here. It means women. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Chou <em>er’s </em>recommendation made Wanyan Bao Zhu widen her eyes. Completely in disbelief, she asked: “It can also be done like that?”</p>
 <p>“Of course!”</p>
 <p>Chou <em>er</em> revealed a shiny smile, but inside her head appeared the scene in the dungeon. The way that man breathed, those straws contaminated with red blood, that candle-dim lit night; she wouldn’t forget such humiliation for life. She vowed, she must get revenge. She must let Murong Qi Qi feel that living was more painful than death!</p>
 <p>“However, princess what you need to do now is plan how to do the first step well. This time, Nan Lin <em>wang</em> is the leader of Bei Zhou. For the woman he loves, he will surely do his best to get the first place. How to do, how to destroy is what you need to pay attention to the most. Although Nan Lin <em>wang </em>is not a participant, but this slave has&nbsp;heard that the subordinates of Nan Lin <em>wang </em>are very capable……”</p>
 <p>“Ah, you can rest assured about this!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her head and revealed a mocking smile.</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong </em>doesn’t know how it’s in other countries, but Bei Zhou always sends four men and four women, eight players. It so happens that <em>bengong </em>is also a participant this year and <em>bengong </em>also knows the other three players. There isn’t anybody in Bei Zhou who doesn’t know that <em>bengong </em>likes Cang <em>gege</em>. If they want to block bengong’s fate, <em>bengong </em>won’t go easy on them! <em>Bengong </em>will come forward for this matter, they won’t not give me face. By that time, even if Cang <em>gege </em>has the heart, he will be powerless.”</p>
 <p>“But there are always exceptions…….”</p>
 <p>“Humph! If they can’t be used by <em>bengong, </em>then there’s no need to keep them!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>She means that if they can’t be used by her, then they must die. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>The last sentence, Wanyan Bao Zhu said it like <em>to chop the nail and slice the iron. </em>The viciousness on her face was no different from Chou <em>er</em>’s.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>To chop a nail and slice the iron: resolute and decisive, unhesitating</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
