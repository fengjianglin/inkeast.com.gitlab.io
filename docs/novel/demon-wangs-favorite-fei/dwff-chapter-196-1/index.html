 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 196 The black hearted wolf</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Black hearted means ruthless and lacking in conscience</em>.</li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>These words coming from elder Teng Yuan were merciless but also inevitable and right. His system of values was like this. To elder Teng Yuan, life was all about equivalent exchanges. You want to get rid of the <em>gu, </em>no problem, then, do it according to the rules of Qiang tribe.</p>
 <p>However, when Taji Guli heard these words, they were a cold rejoice in another people’s calamity. If the three tests were really so difficult and something happened to Feng Cag when he is going through the tests, then what should she do? No, she didn’t want anything to happen to Feng Cang!</p>
 <p>“How did you pass the three tests?”</p>
 <p>“Secret!” Elder Teng Yuan laughingly shook his head. He kept his mouth shut and didn’t want to reveal it. “I see that the opinions of you three aren’t the same. You’d better go talk about it and come with a unified result before coming to find me. Otherwise, if <em>one of your opinion is at the south, the other is at the north</em>, it would be very difficult on me.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>One of your opinions at the south, the other is at the north: to act in a way that defeats one’s purpose</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Elder Teng Yuan came to Duyi and opened his hand. “Where is the thing I want? Give it to me! Just now, I told you an important piece of information. Give me some of the Immortal cream! Otherwise, if I fall ill, I can’t help you get more information!”</p>
 <p>Duyi didn’t take out the Immortal cream directly. Instead, he looked at Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>“Give one box to elder!”</p>
 <p>With Longze Jing Tian’s ‘instruction’, Duyi took out a very small box and handed it to elder Teng Yuan. “Smoke it slowly (use little). It won’t be good if you smoke too much!”</p>
 <p>“Not good? Then, why do you still give it to me?” After hearing Duyi, elder Teng Yuan retorted. This made Duyi a bit in an awkward position. In the end, he could only laugh helplessly.</p>
 <p>After getting what he wanted, elder Teng Yuan took out a large bag. With his hands on his back, he slowly walked out. “Wait patiently! I will keep in touch with you anytime! Remember, don’t run off to anywhere! If you are discovered by our tribe’s people, by then, I don’t know you!”</p>
 <p>After elder Teng Yuan left, Taji Guli’s hook slammed on the stone wall. The iron hook collided with the wall which made a golden spark. “Longze, do we really have to believe this old bastard? He really won’t dupe us?”</p>
 <p>“Presumably not.” Longze Jing Tian looked at the forest on the outside. He frowned, “The people of the Qiang tribe are united. Only elder Teng Yuan is an exception. We can only act from here (him). Now, we only need to see if Duyi’s Immortal cream is effective!”</p>
 <p>Duyi wasn’t so sure about Longze Jing Tian’s words. He had just once heard from Misha by coincident that the thing made from poppy seeds would let people become addicted to it. As a result, it would let him (M) be able to control that person.</p>
 <p>Originally, Penglai Island had a lot of poppies. However, Misha said that they were poison and ordered to have a large area of poppies burned. Furthermore, he didn’t allow anyone on the island to grow poppies. When Duyi went to the mainland and discovered the poppy flowers, he did as Misha once mentioned and made a cream from the poppy seeds. After many failures, he finally made the present Immortal cream.</p>
 <p>The reason he gave it this name was because after taking this cream, one would get a fluttering feeling like a floating immortal. It could let people forget the ugliness of the world and immerse themselves in the ideal world. It was just like being in a fairyland.</p>
 <p>Duyi had tried some once. After he saw those hallucinatory things, he immediately stopped taking it. As Misha said, this thing can be addictive. So much that it would let people be immersed in the virtual world. Taking too much was completely the same as looking for your own death.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for the sake of controlling elder Teng Yuan, Duyi wouldn’t have taken out the Immortal cream.</p>
 <p>He knew clearly well about the power of this thing. He was also afraid that the prescription would be revealed and used by someone with ulterior motives to produce a large amount of it. By then, it would harm people greatly. As for the prescription, Duyi remembered it in his heart. He hadn’t even told his two partners. Only this time, Duyi said to himself. Only to achieve their purpose. When he gets what he wants, he would then stop.</p>
 <p>However, it seemed that the effect the Immortal cream had on elder Teng Yuan wasn’t as great as Duyi imagined. Over the past month, he had been continuously increasing the amount, but elder Teng Yuan didn’t show the addiction that Duyi thought that he would show. Could it be that because he was a master, he has more self-control and is resistant towards the Immortal cream?</p>
 <p>“It would take Feng Cang’s group some time before they arrive. I believe that during this period of time, elder Teng Yuan will certainly become inseparable from the Immortal cream. You can rest assured!” Although, he wasn’t so confident in his heart, but in order to give his partners confidence, Duyi still painted an optimistic future for them.</p>
 <p>After dealing with the matter of the Immortal cream, Longze Jing Tian looked at Taji Guli. “If Feng Cang insist on going through the three tests, what would you do? If by chance he died, then what would you do?”</p>
 <p>Taji Guli didn’t know the answers to what she would do if these two situations happen.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang would certainly mount the mountains of dagger, go through the sea of flames and enter the dragon pool to save his biological son. Even listening to these three tests sounds terrifying, let alone go through them. How should she stop Feng Cang? This question had been plagued Taji Guli. Could it be that she should go to Feng Cang and beg him not to go? In accordance with Feng Cang’s personality, he would certainly kill her and then continue to go through the three tests.</p>
 <p>“Longze, do you have any good ideas?” Taji Guli couldn’t think of a way to resolve it. She could only resort to asking Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>When the three of them formed a team, Duyi and Taji Guli agreed tacitly that Longze Jing Tian was their leader.</p>
 <p>On the matters related to Feng Cang, Taji Guli was the person who was baffled on spot. She couldn’t think of any good way. Moreover, Taji Guli knew that Longze Jing Tian hates Feng Cang and wanted to kill Feng Cang. The hate he has for Feng Cang is deep as the hate Taji Guli has for Feng Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>It was just, when they joined hands, they reached an agreement. They won’t hurt Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang. They will only separate this couple, and each will get one. Now, hearing Longze Jing Tian say that, Taji Guli knows that he definitely must’ve thought of a good idea.</p>
 <p>“I do have an idea, but it’s not easy to do it.”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian and Taji Guli’s thoughts were complete opposite of each other. He would be happy to see Feng Cang die during the three tests. Then, he can take over Feng Qi Qi and become a pair of perfect lovers with Feng Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>However, this was only Longze Jing Tian’s wishful thinking. When he joined forces with Taji Guli, he knew he was doomed that things won’t go his way. For example, when dealing with his matter, they had a dispute. They had to find a solution that was accepted by the both of them and result in what they both wanted.</p>
 <p>“What way?” The moment she heard that Longze Jing Tian could save Feng Cang, inside Taji Guli’s eyes shone a peculiar light. “Say it quickly! What kind of way?”</p>
 <p>“Since everything Feng Cang was doing is for his son Feng Xiao, wouldn’t it be fine if we just kill Feng Xiao while he (FC) is going through the three tests?”</p>
 <p>While Longze Jing Tian was talking, Duyi felt a chillness. Feng Xiao was just a baby that hasn’t been born for a long time! Putting their hands one a child who didn’t even have the strength to truss a chicken was crossing the line a bit for Duyi. “Don’t involve me in this matter! I won’t put my hands on a child!”</p>
 <p>Duyi shook his head and retreated to a side. His enemy was not a baby. To vent anger on a child, what kind of man is this?!</p>
 <p>The idea that was denied by Duyi had been approved by Taji Guli. That’s right! Didn’t Feng Cang come from the Bei Zhou of thousand miles away to Nan Feng just to cure the <em>gu</em> for Feng Xiao?! As long as Feng Xiao died, Feng Cang wouldn’t need to do those risky things! Every problem was because of Feng Xiao!</p>
 <p>Taji Guli wasn’t like Duyi. The one she loves is Feng Cang. Feng Xiao was Feng Cang’s child born from another woman. In other words, Feng Xiao was Taji Guli’s thorn in her eyes and flesh. She couldn’t wait to be finished with him! Originally, Taji Guli hated Feng Qi Qi more, but she had an agreement with Longze Jing Tian to not hurt Feng Qi Qi. So, the only way to solve the problem now was to get rid of Feng Xiao.</p>
 <p>“I say, can you not think of a more appropriate way? Don’t you feel shame for putting your hands on a child?” Although Duyi was one of the cheap trio, but after all, he lived on Penglai Island for a long time. He had been influenced by the island and wasn’t truly a person wicked beyond redemption. It was somewhat difficult for Duyi to understand Taji Guli and Longze Jing Tian’s decision.</p>
 <p>“Duyi, can you think of a better way? If you can help me figure out how to stop Feng Cang, then, I will not hurt that child.”</p>
 <p>Taji Guli already made up her mind that she would do anything in order to let Feng Cang live. Even if her hands were contaminated with blood, it would be fine as long as it’s for Feng Cang’s good.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, when people are too obsessed with something, their mind would become sick.</p>
 <p>You eagerly presented your heart to the other party and hoped to get the other party’s love, but how would you know that what the other party likes is this? Like how Taji Guli, under Longze Jing Tian’s instigation thought that as long as she killed Feng Xiao, she would be able to stop Feng Cang from ‘killing himself’. Why won’t she think about how Feng Cang would feel after she killed his beloved son and how would he treat her then?</p>
 <p>Duyi wanted to say these to Taji Guli, but after some thoughts, he decided to keep his mouth shut. From his point of view, as long as the matter was related to Feng Cang, Taji Guli would turn from a sensible woman to a madwoman. It would be useless no matter how much he said. She was someone who wouldn’t cry before seeing the coffin. Even when seeing the coffin, her heart (love) still wouldn’t die.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have a better way! I can only tell you, you won’t be so lucky every time to be able to escape at the right moment.”</p>
 <p>How could Taji Guli not understand the hidden meaning behind Duyi’s words?</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi also came with Feng Cang this time. Taji Guli knew clearly well how powerful Feng Cang is. As for Feng Qi Qi’s ability, Taji Guli remembered it well. Her left hand was broken at the hands of Feng Qi Qi. That kind of pain would let Taji Guli wake up from a nightmare even now.</p>
 <p>Feng Xiao had such parents as well as Wanyan Kang, Su Mei and Jin Mo, such high skilled people at his side; to kill Feng Xiao under their watch was something very difficult. Although, Longze Jing Tian’s proposal was a good idea, but the feasibility of it was indeed difficult.</p>
 <p>Taji Guli looked at her two companions. She wished to get help from them. Duyi shrugged his shoulders and expressed his attitude. Longze Jing Tian returned her with one sentence that stifled Taji Guli, “Feng Cang is what you want.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t want to help me. I will find someone myself!”</p>
