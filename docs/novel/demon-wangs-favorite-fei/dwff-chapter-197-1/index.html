 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 197 Giving Feng Xiao a little brother</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>From Taji Guli’s point of view, if one was human, they would have loopholes.</p>
 <p>Even with Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi there, there would always be gaps. Even tigers would doze off, let alone humans! Anyway, there was ample of time. Now, Feng Cang hasn’t arrived yet. It was useless even if she was impatient.</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian naturally knew what Taji Guli was thinking. To him, Taji Guli was a hot-blooded (reckless) woman . With a bit of instigation, she would change a single spark into a prairie fire. This was typical of a woman who has the beauty but not the brains. Aside from her tenacity, it seemed that she didn’t have any other good points. Even that tenacious and unyielding character had become a <em>bull’s horn</em>. An obstinate and stubborn woman was really not cute at all!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Bull’s horn: to waste time on an insoluble or insignificant problem</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Looking at Taji Guli, Longze Jing Tian thought of Feng Qi Qi. That crafty woman was a thousand, ten thousand times better than the woman in front of him. They’re both women, why was the difference so big? If it wasn’t because he didn’t have enough power now and needed to ‘form an alliance’ with Taji Guli, he wouldn't have chosen such a stupid partner.</p>
 <p>However, with such a person here, he could use her as a gun. Anyway, his goal was Feng Qi Qi. As long as he could get Feng Qi Qi, he was willing to do anything.</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi who was far away on the road sneezed two times at this time. She rubbed her itchy nose. “Who is thinking about me?”</p>
 <p>“Miss, didn’t you say in the past that sneezing once was that someone was thinking about you; sneezing twice was that someone was scolding you?” While Su Mei was sewing shoes in the form of tiger heads for Feng Xiao, she looked at Feng Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Right, ah! What I said was for ordinary people. In my case, sneezing once is that one person was thinking about me. Sneezing twice is that two people were thinking about me…and so on!”</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi’s words made Su Mei shook her head. She lowered her head and continue to do needlework.</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi was not good at things like needlework and embroidery. She hadn’t received such training and also didn’t learn these from young like the women of this era. Therefore, Feng Xiao’s clothes and shoes were designed by her and made by hand by Su Mei and Su Yue.</p>
 <p>On the way, Feng Qi Qi asked Ming Yue Cheng to find a carpenter to make a baby cradle. At this time, Feng Xiao was sleeping in the cradle. Feng Qi Qi sung a lullaby. Because Gu Yun Wan and Gu Yun Yao didn’t have anything to do, they helped Su Mei do some needlework like sewing eyes on the tiger head shoes.</p>
 <p>All the way, these women got along harmoniously. There was only one thing that made Feng Qi Qi very surprised. That was the attitude Ming Yue Cheng had towards Gu Yun Yao. It wasn’t like how it was rumored to be.</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng announced to the world that in this lifetime he would only have Gu Yun Yao as his only women. He won’t select consort in this life anymore. This incident made Feng Qi Qi admire him very much. In this feudal dynasty, it was not easy for a man who stood at the highest position to make such a promise to the woman he loves. Especially that Ming Yue Cheng was able to break all the pressure and stick to his decision. This was very remarkable and admirable.</p>
 <p>However, after this period of observation, Feng Qi Qi discovered that these two people were not like a man and a woman in love. No joy of a newly-wedded bride could be seen from Gu Yun Yao. Also, Ming Yue Cheng treated her with politeness. Or better said, it was more appropriate to describe it as coldness. No matter how you look at these two, they seemed strange.</p>
 <p>While Feng Qi Qi was observing Gu Yun Yao, Gu Yun Yao was also sizing her up.</p>
 <p>Gu Yun Yao was not a fool. The attitude Ming Yue Cheng had towards Feng Qi Qi these past few days was enough for her to guess who the person in Ming Yue Cheng’s heart was. Originally, Gu Yun Yao thought that Ming Yue Cheng liked Gu Yun Wan. Because of Gu Yun Wan’s identity as ‘empress dowager’, so he had no way but to use such a way to evade.</p>
 <p>However, after seeing Feng Qi Qi, Gu Yun Yao knew she made a mistake. The one Ming Yue Cheng truly loved is Feng Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Now, Gu Yun Yao knew who the “Qi Qi” Ming Yue Cheng talked about was. She also knew why this man did so many things. He was keeping his body pure as jade for her; for a dream that can be wished for but that won’t become reality. He insisted on his heart and maintained his. This man couldn’t help but let people feel sorry for him.</p>
 <p>However, it was one thing to feel sorry for Ming Yue Cheng, Gu Yun Yao didn’t have any improper thoughts. She was a calm and intelligent woman. She would never covet something that wouldn’t belong to her. Even if Ming Yue Cheng was the highly emperor of a country, Gu Yun Yao had never had any illusions about him. Moreover, after getting to know that the person in his heart was someone that she couldn’t be compared to, she would even more not do any of those unrealistic dreams.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>After being on the road for ten days, they were finally about to reach White Bird mountain.</p>
 <p>“There are still two days left!” When Gu De told this news to everyone, Su Mei was obviously relieved. She was used to riding on a horse. Now, being inside the carriage for all day really suffocated her. So, the moment they arrived at the inn, Su Mei immediately jumped off the carriage and stretched her muscles.</p>
 <p>Contrary to Su Mei, Feng Qi Qi carefully went off the carriage. With Feng Cang’s help, they took the cradle from the carriage. Even if it was a very common movement, she was able to make it look very ‘elegant’, making Gu Yun Yao a bit infatuated from looking at her. In her heart, she was more certain about why Ming Yue Cheng would be so attached to Feng Qi Qi. This woman was like a painting that could move, making people unable not to indulge in it.</p>
 <p>“What are you looking at?” When Gu Yun Yao’s mind was elsewhere, Ming Yue Cheng’s voice rang beside her. “Are you not going to get off the carriage?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, right now!” Gu Yun Yao jumped from the carriage. When she looked again, Feng Qi Qi had already gone far away.</p>
 <p>Really a beauty! Gu Yun Yao knew that she couldn’t learn the noble aura that Feng Qi Qi emitted with every movement. Even the way she swayed when she walked was so beautiful like a rose in the wind; touching yet not losing its pureness.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Seeing the dazed Gu Yun Yao, Ming Yue Cheng stopped in his tracks. “You seem a bit strange today.”</p>
 <p>“No, nothing.” Gu Yun Yao didn’t want to let Ming Yue Cheng know that she had discovered his secret. She quickly denied and followed behind Ming Yue Cheng to the inn.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Fu Er had long let everyone prepare everything. When everyone entered, everything was arranged properly. After having dinner together, everyone returned to their room. After Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang entered their room, Jin Mo followed them.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye [1. Wangye/wang: the prince of first rank]</em>, a letter from the house.”</p>
 <p>Jin Mo brought the news from Nalan Xin. The whole way from Bei Zhou to Nan Feng, every three days, Nalan Xin would write a letter about every movement in the capital, including the matters of Fo Sheng Men to Feng Cang. So, even if Feng Cang wasn’t in the capital, he could also know what was going on at that side.</p>
 <p>After reading the letter, Feng Cang nodded. Jin Mo retreated. Feng Qi Qi came to Feng Cang’s side. “Something happened at home?”</p>
 <p>“Everything is fine at home. It was just, Longze Jing Tian and Taji Guli haven’t been found yet.”&nbsp; When he said this, Feng Cang’s eyebrow shook slightly. Even Fo Sheng Men and Moyu hadn’t found them. Could it be that these two people grew wings and flew away?</p>
 <p>“Could it be that someone helped them in secret? So, we couldn’t find them? Or, some people don’t want us to find them?”</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi’s words let Feng Cang thought about the disappearance of Taji Guli at Feng Xiao’s one-month old banquet.</p>
 <p>That day, Wanyan Kang closed the gates at the fastest speed. Then, the Eagle troop did a thorough search. In the end, she was still able to escape. This shows that someone from Bei Zhou’s officials was a group with them.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, it seemed that we need to do a new investigation.” He didn’t know why, but Feng Cang had a hunch that something was about to happen. Since the interior of Bei Zhou wasn’t clean, then they need to find the domestic bad mouse first! Lest to let one mouse’s poop spoil a whole pot of soup.</p>
 <p>After Feng Cang wrote a reply and handed it to Jin Mo, next was the world of this young couple.</p>
 <p>Feng Qi Qi sat on the bed and breastfed Feng Xiao. The luster of the candlelight lit on her beautiful facial features, making her look more beautiful and touching. Feng Cang walked to her and sat next to Feng Qi Qi. He lowered his head and looked at how Feng Xiao used all his strength to suck milk. A happy smile appeared on the corner of his lips.</p>
 <p>This is his wife. This is his child. At this moment, just looking at Feng Qi Qi and Feng Xiao, Feng Cang’s exhaustion would be swept away.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look!” Feng Qi Qi turned slightly to let Feng Cang not look at her. Being looked by Feng Cang like this while breastfeeding made Feng Qi Qi a little embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, it had been more than two months…” Feng Cang put his head on Feng Qi Qi’s shoulder. His chin rubbed against her shoulder blade. “Jin Mo said that the prohibition could be lifted two months after birth. I…want you so much.”</p>
 <p>The intimate words of Feng Cang made Feng Qi Qi’s ears burn. It seemed that the two of them haven’t been intimate for a long time. Feng Cang had always adhered to the principle of protecting his wife. Even if it was hard for him to bear, he only used shower to relieve his heat. Counting it, he had been an ascetic monk for months.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, do you want me?” Feng Cang’s breath lingered on Feng Qi Qi’s ear letting her ears feel itchy and numb. “You say, should we give Feng Xiao a little brother or a little sister?”</p>
 <p>“All good…” Feng Qi Qi turned her head. Her lips just happened to rub on Feng Cang’s lips. The two looked at each other. Their eyes were full of love.</p>
 <p>“Good! If we have a son, we three will protect you. If we have a girl, we two will protect you and our daughter.”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang just wanted to seize the opportunity to kiss Feng Qi Qi, he didn’t expect that a ‘wa…’ sound would separate him and Feng Qi Qi. When he looked, Feng Xiao was looking at his parents with teary eyes with a look of ‘I’m still here. Don’t teach children bad things’. He completely interrupted Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi’s intimacy.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Next to Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi were Ming Yue Cheng and Gu Yun Yao. These two people would pretend to be husband and wife in front of others, but they were not excellent actors. They couldn’t act out the feeling of love. Everyone could see that this pair of emperor and consort was a bit too dull.</p>
 <p>“You sleep on the bed, I will sleep on the ground.”</p>
 <p>There was only one bed in the room. Ming Yue Cheng took a piece of wood and placed it on the ground. Then he also took a quilt to the ground.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Ming Yue Cheng was such a gentleman, Gu Yun Yao couldn’t hep but sigh in her heart. She knew how sincere the feelings between Feng Cang and Feng Qi Qi was. She also knew that Ming Yue Cheng was a good man. It was a pity that there was only one Feng Qi Qi. If she had a twin sister, Ming Yue Cheng wouldn’t need to go on being so alone anymore.</p>
