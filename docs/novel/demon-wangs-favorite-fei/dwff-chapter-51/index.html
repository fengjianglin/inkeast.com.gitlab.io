 <p><em>&gt;Sponsored chapter by Atchara Brown, Josephine Fong and a donator who wanted to stay anonymous&lt;</em></p>
 <p><em>This chapter was&nbsp;edited by ororomunroe90</em></p>
 <p>Chapter 51 Blood colored chrysanthemum</p>
 <p>“Ink mixed with blood. It really is a good paint!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s smile was sweet, but the hands weren’t the slightest bit slacking. The palace maid’s blood spread over the paper. The brush in Murong Qi Qi’s hand began to dance on the paper.</p>
 <p>In the background, there was just silence. No matter if it was the emperor Longze Yu or others, no one had ever seen&nbsp;such a way of painting like Murong Qi Qi’s; using fresh human blood as paint. Originally, it was an extremely monstrous picture, but because of Murong Qi Qi’s brush dance, it became beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Princess, this slave is wrong, this slave is wrong! This slave doesn’t dare anymore!”</p>
 <p>The palace maid felt that her life is slipping away, but Murong Qi Qi didn’t seem to have any intention of stopping the bleeding for her. She was feeling somewhat dizzy. Her thinking also became slow. If she continues like this, she will definitely bleed to death!</p>
 <p>“Say who is behind you, then <em>bengong</em>[1. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family] will let you off!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s voice was very low. So low that only the two of them could hear.</p>
 <p>Speak out? The palace maid shuddered. Making her confess that it’s the empress who let her deliberately break the porcelain box so that&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi would&nbsp;not have any&nbsp;paint to use? Then in the end, she would also die!</p>
 <p>In just a moment, the palace maid weighed the pros and the cons. She decided to protect Duanmu Qing.</p>
 <p>“Princess, this slave begs you. Please let thsi slave go!”</p>
 <p>The palace maid cried hysterically. She was gambling, gambling that Murong Qi Qi wouldn’t dare <em>to treat human life as grass</em>, gambling that Murong Qi Qi would care about the so called virtues and morality and will be forced to let her go under public pressure.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
   <ul>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <li><em>to treat human life as grass: to kill people as if you're&nbsp;cutting grass/a politician acting with total disregard for the life of his countrymen</em></li>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
   </ul>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>The palace maid’s hesitation made Murong Qi Qi’s last vestiges of compassion die. The palace maid completely estimated wrongly. Not everyone can fathom Murong Qi Qi's mind. The dagger once again appeared in Murong Qi Qi’s hand. The dagger went down. A trail of red once again surfaced.</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong </em>just needs some color. <em>Bengong </em>doesn’t want your life.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s voice was very soft and gently without a trace of evilness.</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong’s </em>future husband has an e<em>vil </em>doctor. I heard that as long as there’s still one breath inside the person, he'd be able to save that person. Don’t worry, the heavens want virtues. Besides,&nbsp;<em>bengong </em>will soon be marrying to Bei Zhou, that’s why <em>bengong </em>also needs to amass good fortune. So <em>bengong </em>will absolutely not kill you!”</p>
 <p>‘Still one breath’. Those words made the palace maid’s whole body turn cold. Does she (MQQ) mean that all her blood will be drained till there’s only one last breath left? Then, how can she still live?</p>
 <p>The palace maid, who previously had illusions about princess Zhao Yang’s character, completely lost hope. She could only struggle and shout over and over: “Empress <em>niangniang</em>[2. Niangniang: used to refer the females of the imperial family by someone of lower rank], save me!”</p>
 <p>This shout let people see the hidden intention. The way they looked at Duanmu Qing also became strange. By this time, although on the surface, Duanmu Qing looked dignified, but in her heart, she was hating this palace maid for not carrying out the mission well. Such a small thing and she can’t even do it properly.&nbsp;And the fact that she (palace maid) actually confessed that it was her (DQ) intention to kill made her hatred grow even more.</p>
 <p>“Since you've mentioned&nbsp;empress <em>niangniang, </em>then <em>bengong </em>cannot not give face to empress.”</p>
 <p>The drained blood was almost enough. Besides, she had already achieved her purpose. Murong Qi Qi finally let go. The palace maid, who had bled excessively, stumbled. She fell from the platform onto the ground. Blood spilled all over. Two eunuchs immediately came forward and dragged the palace maid away.</p>
 <p>Seeming to have sensed the empress’ intention to kill, the palace maid began to struggle.</p>
 <p>“Empress <em>niangniang, </em>have mercy, ah! <em>Niangniang, </em>please forgive this slave ! <em>Niangniang… …”</em></p>
 <p>“Still not blocking her mouth!”</p>
 <p>Even if Duanmu Qing could camouflage well, but at this moment, anger couldn’t help but rise. Seeing Murong Qi Qi’s faintly smiling eyes, Duanmu Qing’s heart thumped. Her hand unconsciously touched her belly.</p>
 <p>So it’s like that… …. Coldness flashed in Murong Qi Qi’s eyes. Using her to get pregnant. At this moment, she turned against this benefactor. In the imperial family, it seemed that there’s always such ungrateful people.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s cold eyes scanned Duanmu Qing’s belly, making Duanmu Qing’s whole body shiver. Why does she have a feeling of being targeted by a hunter?</p>
 <p>“<em>Niangniang… ….”</em></p>
 <p>The palace maid was still struggling. Her mouth has just been&nbsp;blocked and she was&nbsp;dragged down by force.</p>
 <p>She's just a small palace maid. Was there a need to kill? Murong Qi Qi looked at the bloodstains on the ground and sighed slightly. But there were so many of such innocent souls. She already gave the palace maid the right to choose. It’s just that she didn’t grasp the chance. After all, there are only a small number of smart people… ….</p>
 <p>Just as Duanmu Qing was becoming ill at&nbsp;ease, a ‘the incense has burned’ could&nbsp;be heard, making everyone’s attention go&nbsp;back&nbsp;to the competition. Ming Yue Xin and Longze Yu Er had already finished. Even Murong Qi Qi put down her brush.</p>
 <p>Just now, Ming Yue Xin and Longze Yu Er saw how Murong Qi Qi took human blood. Their hearts were also scared. They didn’t expect that of Murong Qi Qi, who had seemed so weak, but her actions were so scary.</p>
 <p>Recalling the scene of painting with blood, Longze Yu Er was suddenly somewhat afraid. She was afraid that if she lost, Murong Qi Qi would really want her pair of hands.</p>
 <p>But after a second thought, she's a country’s princess. Even if Murong Qi Qi didn’t <em>give face to the monk, she needs to give face to the Buddha</em>. Murong Qi Qi wouldn’t do anything to her. Moreover, she still has Murong Qi Qi’s ‘information to be used against her’. By that time, if Murong Qi Qi made things difficult for her, then don’t blame her (LYR)&nbsp;for betraying and announcing everything!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
   <ul>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <li><em>Not giving face to the monk, giving face to the Buddha: not giving face to Longze Yu Er but needs to give face to emperor</em></li>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
   </ul>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Three paintings were taken up by six palace maid to&nbsp;be&nbsp;displayed to the public. The two maids in charge of&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi’s painting saw the bloodstained dagger and shook with fright. They cautiously took the painting in&nbsp;fear that if something went&nbsp;wrong, they would end&nbsp;up&nbsp;like that palace maid.</p>
 <p>All three paintings painted a garden full of chrysanthemum, but the styles were&nbsp;very different.</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Xin’s painting was full of gold, very extravagant. Longze Yu Er used more colors. The painting was colorful, making it look more beautiful and youthful. And Murong Qi Qi’s painting attracted everyone’s attention.</p>
 <p>Firstly, it’s because of the style&nbsp;of painting; using blood as paint was too shocking. Secondly, it's because of Murong Qi Qi’s painting. Ink for the branches and leaves. Blood for the flowers, buds and butterflies. This was a chrysanthemum map! Blood colored chrysanthemum that was&nbsp;full of killing intention, making people who looked at it really frightened!</p>
 <p>“Rustling sound of the west wind flew over the garden full of plants. Pistil fragrant cold butterflies are difficult to come. If in that year I become the young emperor, announce that the peach flowers will blossom in the first season.”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng stepped forward on his&nbsp;moon clogs, holding a wine bottle and with a body covered in the smell of alcohol, walked shakily up the stairs towards the painting. He read out loud Murong Qi Qi’s poem that had been&nbsp;written on the right side of the painting.</p>
 <p>“Good poem! Good poem, ah!”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng’s voice was loud. The poem coming from his mouth sounded particularly charming. These officials present, which one is not an expert? When they heard this poem, they couldn’t not be impressed by the aloofness and arrogance of the poem. Is this really made by a rubbish? Why did&nbsp;such a little girl have such a state of mind?</p>
 <p>“You won!”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng looked at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Previously, they were too far separated from each other and he didn’t look carefully at her. Now, she's standing right in&nbsp;front of him. He carefully took this girl into his eyes. Although this girl's just ordinary, but she has a pair of eyes that are more bright than the sun, and is able to make the precious gem on earth lose against this pair. Why didn’t anybody notice it before?</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong </em>refuses to accept!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Ming Yue Cheng to speak again, Ming Yue Xin jumped in.</p>
 <p>“Ming Yue Cheng, are you still Nan Feng’s people? How can your <em>elbow turn the wrong way</em> and help outsiders?! Did she give you some benefits?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
   <ul>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <li><em>Elbow turns the wrong way: favor an outsider instead of someone on one’s own side</em></li>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
   </ul>
   <p></p>
