 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 207 (Part 1) Love is in sky of affection (6)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang was beaten up, but he didn’t get angry. Instead, he handed the letter he had just received to Su Mei. “Look! My cousin and cousin-in-law took my aunt and uncle with them to the Number one village under Heavens to enjoy their life and left me here. Little Mei <em>er</em>[1. Er: term of endearment], don’t you feel pity for me? Don’t you agree that they are bullying me?!”</p>
 <p>As soon as Su Mei heard that it was Feng Qi Qi's letter, she was extremely overjoyed. “Miss sent a letter? I don’t even know how miss is doing at the moment. How’s her morning sickness now? Did it get better?”</p>
 <p>Although she has become the country’s empress and was addressed as such by others when she went out, her way of addressing Feng Qi Qi didn’t change at all, because she still regarded her (FQQ) as her miss in her heart.</p>
 <p>After she finished reading the letter, Su Mei’s happy expression turned into a pout. It was apparent that she was not happy at the moment. Wanyan Kang knew that she also wanted to go to the Number one village under Heavens, but she was pregnant, and this was her first pregnancy, so she had to stay in the palace to give birth. Otherwise, just based on Su Mei and Feng Qi Qi’s good relationship, it was certain that she would have thrown him, this emperor aside and followed her miss to the Number one village under Heavens.</p>
 <p>“Little Mei <em>er</em>, don't be sad. When the baby’s born, I’ll take you to Yongzhou, alright?”</p>
 <p>“Humph! Still talking?! It’s all your fault! You, this bad guy!” As soon as Su Mei thought of this, she will get angry. She had never been away from Feng Qi Qi for such a long time. Even more now, when Feng Qi Qi had to take care of three children. She (SM) didn’t know if she (FQQ) will be able to endure it. It was by coincidence that Su Mei got pregnant and couldn’t stay at Feng Qi Qi’s side. All of these was brought by the ‘culprit’ Wanyan Kang.</p>
 <p>When she thought of this, Su Mei punched Wanyan Kang once.</p>
 <p>“Aiya, little Mei <em>er</em>, it hurts so much!” Wanyan Kang held his chest and lowered his body. He kept shouting. Although, he had used this trick many times, but it seemed to still be useful at this time.</p>
 <p>“How are you? Does it hurt very much?”</p>
 <p>Su Mei remembered that her punch was not light, she immediately wanted to help Wanyan Kang get up. “I’m sorry! I just missed miss!”</p>
 <p>“Little Mei <em>er</em>, your heart only has cousin-in-law. When had you put me and the child on the first place?” Wanyan Kang squatted on the floor. His voice was choking with sobs. Him being like this made Su Mei flustered. It seemed that Wanyan Kang had never been like this. No matter what she did, Wanyan Kang was always all smiles and had never complained. What happened to him today?</p>
 <p>“I…”</p>
 <p>“Little Mei <em>er</em>, you are my wife and the mother of my child. You are Bei Zhou’s empress. However, in your heart cousin-in-law had always stood at the first place. Do you know how sad that makes me?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang continued to clutch his chest while squatting. He didn’t look at Su Mei and his voice trembled.</p>
 <p>Him being like this made Su Mei had some doubts in her heart. Could it be that she really cared too much about Feng Qi Qi and so neglected Wanyan Kang? She originally thought that Wanyan Kang wouldn’t care about these. She didn’t expect him to really care.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I was only worried about miss. She’s also pregnant now and has a really bad morning sickness. I was worried about miss’s body…”</p>
 <p>“Then what about me? Had you ever worried about me? I’m not made of iron. I also need your concern…”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang continued to complain, making Su Mei at loss about what to do for a moment.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry! I didn’t know you will be so sad…How about, I care more about you in the future?”</p>
 <p>Su Mei’s answer made Wanyan Kang’s eyes smirk. It was just, he didn’t express it. Instead, his voice trembled more. “Little Mei <em>er</em>, are you telling the truth?”</p>
 <p>“Mm! Of course, I promise you!”</p>
 <p>After hearing Su Mei promise, Wanyan Kang finally let out a sigh of relief and raised a face full of smiles. “It seemed that little Mei <em>er</em> still cares about me!”</p>
 <p>Seeing through that Wanyan Kang was teasing her, Su Mei glared and was about to curse him when she saw the tender feelings in his eyes. She swallowed the words that were in her mouth. When Feng Qi Qi left, she told Su Mei about what had happened that day on the seven-level pagoda and also told Su Mei with meaningful and heartfelt words that she must be kind to Wanyan Kang. In fact, he didn’t look as sunny as he appeared on the surface.</p>
 <p>At this time, seeing Wanyan Kang like this, Su Mei reached out and gently helped him up.</p>
 <p>“Actually, the person I care about the most in my heart is you!” Su Mei nestled in Wanyan Kang’s arms like a small bird. Such gentleness made Wanyan Kang feel ‘flattered’. The thought about what Feng Qi Qi said about Su Mei’s past and that she used hot-tempered to cover her fragile heart, Wanyan Kang’s heart softened and held Su Mei in his arms. He put one hand on her five-month big belly that was beginning to stick out.</p>
 <p>“The person I care the most in my heart is also only little Mei <em>er</em>…”</p>
 <p>The two nestled against each other. The sun shone and pulled their shadows and made them very long.</p>
 <p>“After you give birth to the child, I will take you to the Number one village under Heavens to let you see cousin-in-law, alright?”</p>
 <p>“Not right…,” Su Mei shook her head. For the first time, she had the thought to accompany this man. “After giving birth, I still need to restore my health. Besides, miss said that the first three years, it’s easy for the baby to get sick. Going back and forth is not good for the child. Moreover, the country had just stabilized. You have many things to do and also can’t leave. The baby can't be without me and I, also can be without you…It’s better to wait till the child is a bit older to go together!”</p>
 <p>To Wanyan Kang, Su Mei’s words were moving as never before. Su Mei had never said such loving words. She always had the appearance of a small pepper. Now, these words came from Su Mei’s mouth made Wanyan Kang’s heart suddenly be fully filled with happiness.</p>
 <p>“Little Mei <em>er</em>, it’s so good to have you!” Wanyan Kang kissed Su Mei’s forehead. “I love you!”</p>
 <p>“Annoying, we’re already old husband and wife. You still say such cheesy things!” Wanyan Kang’s romantic words made Su Mei blush. Being married for five years with Wanyan Kang, she had never said such loving words to him. Wanyan Kang had also never said them. The two just seem like a quarrelsome but loving couple. The whole way, there wasn’t much sweet talk. What surrounded them seemed to be more ‘opposing each other with equal harshness’.</p>
 <p>Now, Wanyan Kang said the words that Su Mei had been waiting for a long time in her heart. Her heart jumped madly, and her cheeks were also red.</p>
 <p>“Little Mei <em>er</em>, you haven’t said if you love me or not.” Wanyan Kang’s face was slightly thicker than Su Mei’s. He kept staring at Su Mei’s pink neck. His mouth became a rogue. “Tell me, ah. Do you love me or not?!”</p>
 <p>Being tormented by Wanyan Kang, Su Mei had no choice and mumbled, “If I didn’t love you, why would I marry you?!”</p>
 <p>Although the voice was small, but it was heard by Wanyan Kang. However, he didn’t want to let Su Mei off like this. He continued to bother her. “What did you say? I didn’t hear. Can you talk a bit louder? My hearing is impaired!”</p>
 <p>Even though knowing that Wanyan Kang was doing it on purpose, Su Mei still laughed. Then, she grabbed Wanyan Kang’s ear and pulled him to her. “I said I love you!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei deliberately screamed loudly, making Wanyan Kang’s ear shook and made ‘weng’ sounds. But, he was happy in his heart. “I knew you loved me! &nbsp;Where would you find someone as handsome, highly intelligent, confident, easy-going, and monogamous as me?!”</p>
 <p>For the first time Su Mei didn’t argue with Wanyan Kang when he was blowing his own trumpet. Instead, she looked tenderly at his increasingly mature face and was very grateful of this marriage.</p>
 <p>At Yongzhou, Chasing the wind cliff, Number one village under Heavens.</p>
 <p>“Ou…” Feng Qi Qi didn’t remember anymore how many times she had vomited today. Although, it was the third time that she would become a mother, but the morning sickness of this time was worst than the two previous times.</p>
 <p>“Mother, drink some water!”</p>
 <p>“Mother, wipe your mouth!”</p>
 <p>Long Yin Qi and Long Yin Lin stood beside Feng Qi Qi and looked smilingly at Feng Qi Qi. When the little brats saw their mother being in so much pain, one gave her a teacup and the other handed her handkerchief. After seeing this, Wanyan Ming Yue and Feng Xie who were at a side nodded repeatedly.</p>
 <p>After Feng Xiao, Feng Qi Qi gave birth to this pair of twins…Long Yin Qi and Long Yin Lin. The two brats looked exactly the same. The only differences were the second eldest Long Yin Qi had a red like blood mole between his eyebrows and that third eldest Long Yin Lin’s eyes were purple. If it wasn’t because of such obvious differences, others wouldn’t be able to tell them apart.</p>
 <p>However, the favorite game of this twin brothers was ‘Guess who I am’. They were quick-witted and weird. They often hid their characteristics to let other people guess. Aside from Feng Qi Qi and Feng Cang, even Dongfang Lan, Wanyan Ming Yue and Feng Xie couldn’t differentiate who was who. Not to mention other people. They were often cheated.</p>
 <p>At this time, seeing that the two sons changed their usual mischievousness and showed her so much care, Feng Qi Qi reached out and touched the bun like cheeks of the two. “Mother is fine. This is mother’s normal reaction.”</p>
 <p>“Mother, is it so hard being pregnant? Then, when mother gave birth to us and big brother, mothers must’ve suffered a lot!” Long Yin Qi put his small hand on the belly of Feng Qi Qi that didn’t look pregnant yet. “Mother suffered so much. In the future, we must be filial to mother! And not let anyone bully mother!”</p>
 <p>“Right! I also will give the best food to mother and protect mother!” Long Yin Lin clenched his fist as if, if someone was bullying Feng Qi Qi, he would definitely wave out a fist.</p>
 <p>“Good boys!”</p>
 <p>The children being so understanding, even though Feng Qi Qi didn’t feel well, but her mood was very good.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Feng Qi Qi laughed, Long Yin Qi and Long Yin Lin clapped. “Mother laughed! Mother is the most beautiful when you laugh!”</p>
 <p>The moment Feng Cang walked in, he saw such a heart-warming scene. When Long Yin Lin turned, he saw Feng Cang. He immediately rushed over. “Daddy, you’ve returned! Where’s the good thing you brought me?”</p>
 <p>In just a moment, Long Yin Lin climbed into Feng Cang’s arms. Long Yin Qi also didn’t want to be outdone and also climbed into Feng Cang’s arms. His small hands also probed in his (FC) clothes. “Right, ah. Daddy, we took care of mother. Where’s the gift you promised us?”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Feng Cang to speak, Long Yin Qi already found a dagger in Feng Cang’s clothes. Long Yin Lin also found the little sword he wanted.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, daddy! Daddy is as best as mother!” After getting the gift, the two no longer stuck like that on Feng Cang. Instead, they climbed down, rushed to Feng Qi Qi and showed her the gifts in their hands. “Mother, look. Do I look awesome?” “Mother, am I very handsome?”</p>
 <p>The two little handsome boys displayed their treasures in front of Feng Qi Qi. This let the discomfort of Feng Qi Qi reduce a lot.</p>
 <p>“Our family’s babies are the best and the handsomest!”</p>
 <p>With Feng Qi Qi’s praise, the two brothers felt as sweet as if they had eaten honey. “This time we must defeat big brother when he returns!” Long Yin Qi held his own dagger and said to Long Yin Lin, “We must not let big brother get first place again!”</p>
