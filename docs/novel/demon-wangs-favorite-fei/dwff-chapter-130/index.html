 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang’s support made Murong Qi Qi give him a big smile. And their ‘interaction’ fell into Lin Ke Xin’s eyes, making her hate this younger son even more.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, he had a relation with Murong Qi Qi. Now, the emperor had given the right of marriage to Murong Qi Qi. If by chance, she chose Wanyan Kang, then what should she do?! Lin Ke Xin didn’t notice, but her eyes, as she looked at Wanyan Kang, had some hate in them now.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s phrase ‘without love, how could there be hate’ completely destroyed the last hope in Longze Jing Tian’s heart. Her heart had never moved for him; never… As if his soul had been pulled from his body, Longze Jing Tian had gone soft. He was escorted back to his seat by Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji.</p>
 <p>“Haha…,” Wanyan Lie stroked his beard and nodded slightly. Murong Qi Qi’s 'braveness' made Wanyan Lie like this niece even more! If in the past, Ming Yue could be like her, even if he had to offer his life in sacrifice, he would have been willing to do so!</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian acting like this, made Wanyan Bao Zhu the saddest person.</p>
 <p>After being refused by Longze Jing Tian so publicly, she should have felt ashamed. However, Wanyan Bao Zhu didn’t hate Longze Jing Tian. She loved this man and couldn’t afford to hate him. Now, the only person Wanyan Bao Zhu resented was Murong Qi Qi. All was because of Murong Qi Qi. That's why Longze Jing Tian had been humiliated. That's why she had been rejected by Longze Jing Tian!</p>
 <p>Although in her heart, she wished that she could eat Murong Qi Qi, but now Wanyan Bao Zhu had learned how to behave. She didn’t reveal any emotions on her face. There was no sadness nor frustration seen on her face because of being rejected by Longze Jing Tian. Instead, she maintained the gentleness an imperial princess should have.</p>
 <p>“Don’t know what little cousin sister Qi Qi has prepared to give imperial grandmother!” Wanyan Bao Zhu’s words hooked the hearts of the people who'd wanted to look at a joke, and made them switch their focus back to the main matter.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Wanyan Bao Zhu’s expression remained calm, Murong Qi Qi sneered. Didn’t see her for three days, she (WBZ) let her (MQQ) gain a new perspective on her.&nbsp; Murong Xin Lian had become a lot more mature after becoming Wanyan Bao Zhu and didn't act without a brain like before.</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi already gave <em>aijia</em>[1. Aijia: I, used by an empress dowager] her gift!” Dongfang Lan smiled while showing everyone the jewelries on her body, “Qi Qi is really a filial child. She specifically let Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>[2. Gongzi: young master] design this ‘Red Phoenix Facing the Sun’ for <em>aijia</em>. <em>Aijia </em>likes it very much!”</p>
 <p>Just now, everyone’s eyes were on Murong Qi Qi. They hadn't paid any attention to Dongfang Lan’s jewelries. Now that the empress dowager had mentioned it and they'd also heard ‘Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>’; all eyes were now focused on Dongfang Lan’s body.</p>
 <p>Guanghua <em>gongzi’s </em>Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang were world famous places. The jewelries were rare there. Plus the fact that Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>’s character was strange, he would only design one of a kind jewelry. He would never design the same thing twice. So, all the jewelries Tong Bao Zhai sold were unique in this world.</p>
 <p>Now, Murong Qi Qi had actually invited Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>to design a ‘Red Phoenix Facing the Sun’ for Dongfang Lan alone, how much face was that? How much money did that need, ah?!</p>
 <p>The women’s eyes stared like hungry wolves at the hairpins in Dongfang Lan’s hair, the earrings in her ears and the bracelets on her wrists. Their eyes were full of envy, jealousy and hate. Without at least eight to ten thousand golden teals, you wouldn’t be able to get this set!</p>
 <p>Although they were already old, but they still had the heart which loved beauty.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan could read the envy from the eyes of those women. Her mood also got a lot better. It’s still granddaughter who was filial and knew what women liked. Even if she was an old woman, she still couldn’t put down those jewelries.</p>
 <p>“Before, when little cousin sister Qi Qi had married, Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>seemed to have bet greatly on little cousin sister. This time, little cousin sister invited Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>to design jewelries specifically for imperial grandmother; it seemed that you’re very familiar with each other, ah!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu didn’t believe Murong Qi Qi. Who was she? She actually could invite Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>. She must be bragging! This jewelry was certainly bought by Feng Cang to let Murong Qi Qi get face!</p>
 <p>“Guanghua <em>gongzi</em> is a good friend of mine.” While saying this, Murong Qi Qi obviously felt Feng Cang's hand that was holding hers, tighten a bit. It was just, she didn’t think much of it. She also didn’t know that Feng Cang had eaten a lot of vinegar these past few days because of her and Guanghua <em>gongzi’s </em>gossips.</p>
 <p>“Since little cousin sister and Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>are good friends, why don’t you invite him to come give referrals to us?”</p>
 <p>“He doesn’t have time.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? He doesn’t have time or is it that little cousin sister simply doesn’t know Guanghua <em>gongzi</em> and cannot invite him?”</p>
 <p>A pig’s head is still a pig’s head…Looking at Wanyan Bao Zhu’s proud face, Murong Qi Qi sighed. Originally, she thought that after experiencing death once, this woman would get smarter. Just now, she had been praising Wanyan Bao Zhu. She didn’t expect that she (WBZ) couldn’t stand being praised so much.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t answer Wanyan Bao Zhu. Having a conversation with a pig was completely detrimental to her IQ.</p>
 <p>Originally, Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to let Murong Qi Qi unable to extricate herself gracefully. She didn’t expect that Murong Qi Qi would simply ignore her. Now, it became her who stood there awkwardly.</p>
 <p>“Imperial grandmother, today is your birthday. Bao Zhu will present a song for you to liven things up!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was clever once. She used talent to resolve this embarrassment. After Dongfang Lan nodded, someone immediately brought out a zither. Wanyan Bao Zhu sat in front of the zither and played the song &lt;Long May You Live&gt;.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s zither sound was very beautiful. People couldn’t help but close their eyes and immerse themselves in the music. When Wanyan Lie looked at his daughter, there was a trace of strangeness in his eyes.</p>
 <p>When did Wanyan Bao Zhu’s zither skills become so superb? Wanyan Lie knew his own daughter’s personality. Since she was young, Wanyan Bao Zhu was not someone who's well-behaved. Even when practicing zither, she would only practice half-heartedly. However, now the zither skills she was showing would need at least seven to eight years of practice.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi accidentally saw the look in Wanyan Lie’s eyes. It seemed that this emperor had begun to suspect his princess. How should she borrow someone else’s hand to expose Wanyan Bao Zhu’s true face? It would be the best if she could kill two birds with one sword. Otherwise, it would be a wasted opportunity.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was thinking of how to let Wanyan Bao Zhu reveal her original form and Feng Cang’s mood had turned very bad.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s words let Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>, this thorn, appear in Feng Cang’s heart once again. Especially after knowing that Murong Qi Qi had specially invited Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>to design that set of jewelries. Thinking about the fact that they had contacted each other in private, Feng Cang was very unhappy.</p>
 <p>He'd already guarded so strictly, so how did that Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>get in contact with Murong Qi Qi? Could it be that they had their own way of contacting? Or was it that for a certain time, Murong Qi Qi went out in secret to meet him?</p>
 <p>The thought of Murong Qi Qi showing her beauty to another man, made Feng Cang’s heart feel uncomfortable. His eyes also couldn’t help but look in the direction outside the palace as if to penetrate through the thick walls to see Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang and whether or not Nalan Xin had successfully finished the matter.</p>
 <p>Now, his intention of killing Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>intensified. Anyway, regardless of the consequences, he would fight with Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>first the moment he appears and then they could talk! Now was not the time to be a gentleman. He's almost losing his woman, what did he need face for?! At worst, he could let the eagle troop annihilate Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>! He didn’t believe that Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>could fly away during the tactics between fleshes!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s slender fingers circled once on the zither’s strings and ended the whole song satisfactorily. Had to say, although this woman’s personality was bad, but she'd still worked hard on her zither skills.</p>
 <p>“Good, good!” Although Wanyan Lie was suspicious of Wanyan Bao Zhu, but he hadn’t figured this out yet. So, he still maintained the attitude of a good father and rewarded Wanyan Bao Zhu with a pair of jade carved lions. They were the size of a palm and transparent white. With one look, you would know that they were extremely valuable treasures.</p>
 <p>“This subject daughter thanks emperor father!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie’s reward let Wanyan Bao Zhu’s vigilance fall down. She had forgotten that her display of zither skills would bring her a killing calamity.</p>
 <p>Seeing the smile on Wanyan Bao Zhu’s face, Murong Qi Qi felt sad for this pig like woman. Didn’t you see that the emperor was deliberately holding you highly to let you relax and unmask your true nature?!</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu wasn’t aware of it and Murong Qi Qi wouldn’t tell her. This woman was like a tenaciously strong person. Since Wanyan Lie had become suspicious of her, why doesn’t she (MQQ) borrow someone else’s sword to kill?! Wanyan Bao Zhu had provoked her again and again. She (WBZ) truly saw her (MQQ) as someone soft who she (WBZ) could easily pinch!</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi’s mind to turn to the end, Wanyan Bao Zhu once again pointed the gunpoint at her, “Imperial grandmother, granddaughter heard that little cousin sister Qi Qi’s zither skills were superb. Don’t know if she’s willing to play the zither for grandmother.”</p>
 <p>My ass! Murong Qi Qi pulled her middle finger to Wanyan Bao Zhu under the table. This woman truly wants a mile after giving her an inch. Why was she (WBZ) always setting her eyes on her (MQQ)?! Could it be that they had an immense feud? Murong Qi Qi had forgotten that Wanyan Bao Zhu’s mother Zheng Min had died indirectly at her hands.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Qi Qi also knows how to play the zither?” The moment he heard this, Wanyan Lie was very happy. “Your mother was a talent. Since you’re Ming Yue’s daughter, you shouldn’t be bad!”</p>
 <p>After Wanyan Lie said this, even if Murong Qi Qi wasn’t willing, she couldn’t brush Wanyan Lie’s face. Murong Qi Qi was just about to get up when she heard noises from outside the hall.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter?” Wanyan Lie frowned. Jing De quickly trotted away. After a short while, he trotted back. “Answering emperor, it was some palace maids who were talking that Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang are on fire…”</p>
 <p>“What?!” Murong Qi Qi stood up with a look of surprise. How come? How come Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang were on fire? How could this be?! With Fang Kui and Fang Tong there, how could something happen?!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s attitude once again made it difficult to bear for Feng Cang. Is she now worried about Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>? What is the relationship between them?</p>
 <p>“It’s only a shop that caught fire. What is the big fuss about?!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu saw Murong Qi Qi’s expression, but her heart was thinking about another thing. What was she pretending about? Pretending that she had a good relation with Guanghua <em>gongzi</em> and pretending to care about him; was it to improve her own worth? Really shameless. Needs to rely on men for everything!</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie was also very surprised that something had happened to Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai. Although Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>was someone from the <em>jianghu</em>,[3. Jianghu: world of martial arts] but he had a great reputation. The women of the harem also liked the jewelries from his shop very much. Now, hearing that the two places were on fire, it was very surprising.</p>
 <p>The most anxious ones on the scene were the uncountable concubines and consorts and also those ladies from dignified families. The moment they heard that something had happened to those two places, the women got anxious. There was so many beautiful jewelry there, ah! There were also a lot of gorgeous dresses there, ah! Who did it? That person must definitely be jealous of Guanghua and that's why that person did such a despicable thing!</p>
 <p>The talks of the women in the end spread to Wanyan Lie’s ears.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was anxious like ants in a wok!</p>
 <p>The people in Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang were killers of Moyu. Something happening to these two places at the same time, could it be an enemy had come for revenge? Fang Kui and Fang Tong’s abilities weren’t bad. They actually let people set fire to the shop; the other party must be very powerful!</p>
 <p>Now, Murong Qi Qi wished that she could fly out of the palace immediately and go look at how the people of Moyu are! Living together for five years, Murong Qi Qi had long taken Moyu as her own home. Now, there were difficulties at her home and she didn’t know what happened to her brothers; how could she continue sit here indifferently?!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s anxiousness made Feng Cang’s heart turn cold. Sure enough, she’s still very concerned about Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>. So, the moment she had heard the news, she would be nervous like this. For a time, a breath seemed to choke in Feng Cang's chest. It couldn’t go up and pressed very powerfully.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, I want to go take a look at Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai!” Murong Qi Qi couldn’t wait a moment longer. Those were her brothers. If they were truly killed by the enemy, what should they do?! No! She must go there as fast as possible and see what had happened!</p>
 <p>Everyone thought that the emperor definitely wouldn’t agree to Murong Qi Qi leaving the empress dowager’s birthday banquet. Even if you’re good friends with Guanghua <em>gongzi</em>, you didn’t need to be worried like this!</p>
 <p>However, that was only the men’s thoughts. The women’s hearts had already flown out of the palace. Now, they stood at Murong Qi Qi’s side. They hoped that Murong Qi Qi could go and inquire what had happened. They hoped that those treasures and beautiful dresses were not all burned!</p>
 <p>“Alright! Go!” When everyone thought that Wanyan Lie wouldn’t agree, they didn’t expect that he would suddenly nod. What let people be more surprised was that not only did Wanyan Lie agree to let Murong Qi Qi go, he also personally explained to Dongfang Lan, “Empress mother, look, this Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>helped Qi Qi design a set of jewelry for you. Now a friend is in difficulties, why don’t you let Qi Qi go take a look?!”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan was not someone unreasonable. Granddaughter was already so anxious. Of course, she was not happy to see that. Besides, Guanghua <em>gongzi’s </em>reputation wasn’t bad and seeing that anxious expression on Murong Qi Qi, maybe they were not ordinary friends. A girl knowing some excellent guys was also good!</p>
 <p>“Go! Pay attention to your safety! Let your brother follow lest you meet with danger!”</p>
 <p>The two left hurriedly. The lively banquet also quietened because these two had left. The women were too worried about Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang and didn’t have the mood to appreciate the song and dance anymore.</p>
 <p>However, the banquet still had to continue. Besides, this was the empress dowager’s banquet. So, in no time, there were music, songs and dancing. The scene turned lively again.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>When Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang arrived at Jue Se Fang, the fire had already been controlled. Originally, it was a refined small three-story building. Now, it had become a black ruin.</p>
 <p>“Is there someone? Is there still people here?” Murong Qi Qi wanted to rush inside to see the situation, but she was stopped by Feng Cang. “There might still be danger inside. Stay here, I’ll go take a look!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang entered inside. Everywhere was burned. Looking at the neat way, it looked like Nalan Xin had done a good job. Feng Cang was overjoyed. Now, it’s good! Nalan Xin had certainly caught the people. By then, he could use those people to force Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>to appear and see if he could still hook onto Murong Qi Qi!</p>
 <p>“How is it?” Murong Qi Qi immediately went to Feng Cang after he came out. “Are there still some people alive?”</p>
 <p>“There was no one inside. Maybe they had been saved or kidnapped…”</p>
 <p>While talking, Feng Cang examined Murong Qi Qi. He wanted to see her expression. Sure enough, just thinking of the possibility of being ‘kidnapped’ as mentioned by Feng Cang, made Murong Qi Qi’s expression turn ugly.</p>
 <p>Who was it? To actually dare to break the ground over the overhead of god; to actually dare to touch her people! Really impatient to die!</p>
 <p>When Murong Qi Qi personally went inside to inspect, her mood was bad to the extreme. It was like Feng Cang said; there were no corpses, no one had died. Like this, the people of Moyu may had long found out before the enemy had come and retreated or they had all been captured.</p>
 <p>It was just, who had such ability? Murong Qi Qi believed that the people under her weren’t ordinary. Even if it was a real enemy; even using real swords and guns, Moyu’s people wouldn’t be afraid! Besides, in this broad daylight, the other party wouldn’t have also taken action openly. If the other party used underhanded ways, then who would be more underhanded than Moyu’s people?!</p>
 <p>On the way here, she had thought calmly for a long time. She couldn’t figure out who this person was.</p>
 <p>Wu Ji Gong? A group of small bandits. Even if they had Wanyan Hong’s support behind them, they still couldn’t become something. Other sects? That was also impossible. Moyu had always been coming and going alone and wouldn’t warm up or make enemies with people. Moyu didn't have enemies.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi even thought about the court. However, her identity was so secret. Wanyan Lie simply couldn’t know it. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t ruin Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai without a reason. Who was it?</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s expression was dark. The vinegar in Feng Cang’s heart turned into a sea. If it wasn’t because he needed to keep Murong Qi Qi company, he would have long gone to Nalan Xin and would've tortured those people to let them say who that damn Guanghua gongzi was!</p>
 <p>Just burning his shops was too easy on him! This Guanghua <em>gongzi</em> appeared like a god and vanished like a devil. His entire Fo Sheng Men was mobilized and he still couldn’t inquire any news about him. Now, he could only put his hope on the people Nalan Xin caught!</p>
 <p>He hoped that these people had enough value and could let Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>bite on the hook. Now, Feng Cang’s intention of wanting to kill Guanghua<em> gongzi </em>was even more intense!</p>
 <p>He absolutely wouldn’t allow another person to be in Murong Qi Qi’s heart. Even a hair of the other party couldn’t enter! He wouldn’t allow it!</p>
 <p>Just as Murong Qi Qi was thinking about who the one behind the scene was, Su Yue appeared in front of them. She handed a note to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Tonight at <em>haishi</em> (9-11pm), see you at Lion Ridge.”</p>
