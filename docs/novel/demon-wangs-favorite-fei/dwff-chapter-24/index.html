 <p>Chapter 24:&nbsp;Trouble Knocks on the Door</p>
 <p>To some extent, it could be considered that Longze Yu’s behavior was like paying the debt of gratitude with the body. Hearing that Longze Yu would stay at Qing Luan Palace today, Duanmu Qing’s heart immediately jumped from happiness. The times she receives grace wasn’t much, so she needed to grab this chance! That’s right! She must take the ‘having children’ pill. Use all her effort to create a child!</p>
 <p>Just one afternoon, the story of Murong household's third miss being discarded by Longze Jing Tian circulated throughout the capital. She hadn’t even married, yet she received the ‘break off engagement letter’ and Jing <em>wangye</em>[1. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] even used blood to write it. Murong Qi Qi once again became the ‘person of the year’.</p>
 <p>“Miss, as of now, about you being discarded, there’s already ten different versions……”</p>
 <p>Inside Cui Zhu <em>yuan</em>[2. Yuan: part of a residence], Su Mei’s mouth hadn’t stopped moving for one moment.</p>
 <p>“The one that most people accept is that you and your lover Lian <em>gongzi</em>’s[3. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer to a famous unmarried man] child is already two years old. You two were secretly meeting for a date at Duanmu household. The result was that Jing <em>wang </em>caught you two in bed. He was so angry that he vomited blood which sprayed on the wall. At last, he was so furious that he wrote the break engagement letter with his tears stained with blood.”</p>
 <p>“Pu……”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Murong Qi Qi was eating watermelon. A mouthful of watermelon seeds sprayed on Su Mei’s face. Bits and pieces like black moles.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough, Su Mei, sorry, ah!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi wiped Su Mei’s face while laughing.</p>
 <p>“I really didn’t expect such a big response. Now my name could be considered to be able to move the capital……”</p>
 <p>When the news reached Lan Xiang <em>yuan</em>, Liu Yan Zhi and Murong Qing Lian were very happy.</p>
 <p>“Qing <em>er</em>[4.Er: term of endearment], now the second one is ruined, the third one was also ruined. The most precious miss of our prime minister's mansion is you! You have to work hard and catch a rich husband!”</p>
 <p>“Mom……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian stomped. Her cheeks had turned red.</p>
 <p>“Daughter is still young!”</p>
 <p>“What young, ah? You’re fifteen. You can already get married!”</p>
 <p>Liu Yan Zhi hugged her precious daughter. She carefully looked at her. The more she looked, the more she felt that the treasure of her family was the most beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Everybody loves young and talented people, but my daughter must marry the dragon among people. What is Longze Jing Tian? The problem of whether he can or cannot become the crown prince is still a question. Mom will tell you, you need to have an open mind. Don’t only focus on Xi Qi country. At the tournament of the four countries, there will be many princes and nobility. As long as you can participate at the tournament of the four countries, you will find the right one. Qing <em>er</em>, do you understand?!”</p>
 <p>“Mm!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian understood Liu Yan Zhi’s meaning. Among the four countries, Xi Qi country is the smallest. She would not be like Murong Xue Lian whose horizons were narrow and who would be happy as a Imperial noble consort of Xi Qi country.</p>
 <p>At Lan Xiang <em>yuan</em>, the mother and daughter were celebrating for Murong Qing Lian’s beautiful future. At Ou Xiang <em>yuan</em>, Murong Xin Lian aggressively rushed to Cui Zhu <em>yuan </em>with Fei Cui. While ‘resting’ for the past few days, Murong Xin Lian thought carefully about what happened at that night by the pavilion. Plus the fact of what happened to Fei Cui and ‘that battle’ between her and Murong Qing Lian had a strange taste in it. After much thinking, Murong Xin Lian put the cause of all problems on Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>It was definitely that rubbish who did something! Although after Murong Qi Qi came back, she had a submissive appearance, but all the things related to her deviated from their original track. Something must’ve happened in those five years. This rubbish actually became smarter.</p>
 <p>Originally Murong Xin Lian had long wanted to come and cause trouble for Murong Qi Qi, but because of Murong Qi Qi’s status as ‘Jing <em>wangfei</em>[5. Wangfei: the main consort/wife of the prince of first rank]’, she didn’t want to cause trouble for herself in that sensitive stage.</p>
 <p>But now, Murong Qi Qi hadn’t even married, yet she became an abandoned wife. Even if Murong Xin Lian murdered Murong Qi Qi, Murong Tai wouldn’t have any objection. After all, one really beautiful daughter was more valuable than one rubbish who had been discarded!</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, get your ass out!”</p>
 <p>The moment Murong Xin Lian entered Cui Zhu <em>yuan, </em>she let Fei Cui seal the door. She had already inquired, Murong Tai was not in the mansion at this moment. In the afternoon, he had been summoned by the emperor to enter the palace. Presumably, the palace must already know about Murong Qi Qi’s scandal.</p>
 <p>Now Murong Tai must hate Murong Qi Qi to the bones. He was such a person who loves face. Having such a daughter who couldn’t do anything, he must’ve long wanted to crush her to death. In other words, no matter how she treated Murong Qi Qi today, Murong Tai would not oppose it.</p>
 <p>“Where did this vicious dog came from?!”</p>
 <p>A lazy voice reached Murong Xin Lian’s ears. She looked for half a day but didn’t see a person. In the end, Murong Xin Lian looked up and finally saw Murong Qi Qi who was lying on the roof, sunbathing.</p>
 <p>Her hair lay on her chest. Murong Qi Qi had one hand against the pillow. The other hand is holding a fan made from feathers. Su Mei beside her was spoon feeding her a peach smoothie. Su Yue at her side was holding an umbrella to block the sun for Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3265" src="https://rosyfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/yushan.jpg?w=529" alt="yushan"></p>
 <p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi, she had an entirely leisurely look. Where was the half a point of sadness?</p>
 <p>“Yo, second big sister, it’s you who came, ah! Little sister's eyes are really so bad and saw wrong! It’s my sin, my sin!” <em>(she is referring to seeing MXL as a dog)</em></p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was saying ‘sin’, but her face didn’t show even a little guilt. Even the normal cowardice couldn’t be seen, making Murong Xin Lian burst in surprise. Could it be that this was her true face? Were those humble and meek attitudes from before just acting?</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, the matter of my mother, does it have something to do with you?”</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Murong Xin Lian was sure that Zheng Min has been pushed in the pit by Murong Qi Qi. Her mother’s horrible death surfaced again in Murong Xin Lian’s eyes. She clenched her whip. Her eyes glared full of hate at Muong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t seem to have heard Murong Xin Lian’s questioning. Instead, she picked up the cup and gulped the peach smoothie.</p>
 <p>“Su Mei, your workmanship is getting better and better! Next time, make smoothie of grapes. I only want it to be sweet!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, miss!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei endured her laughter and took over the feather fan from Murong Qi Qi and gently fanned for her miss.</p>
 <p>“Bitch!”</p>
 <p>Being ignored by Murong Qi Qi, Murong Xin Lian was really furious. Her feet left the ground and jumped onto the roof.</p>
 <p>“Do you think you’re still Jing <em>wangfei</em>? You have already been discarded and is now a famous abandoned wife of the capital!”</p>
 <p>“And what…..”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi raised her head and narrowed her eyes. It was just that her eyes were clear and she didn’t seem to be sad because of this matter.</p>
 <p>Why wasn’t she ashamed and resentful? Encountering such a matter, being rumoured by people like this, should she not burst into tears, should she not seek death and give up on life? Why was she still so content, so calm? This was puzzling Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>However, when she thought about ‘seeking death and giving up on life’, an idea suddenly emerged in Murong Xin Lian’s mind. That’s right, ah! She could just kill Murong Qi Qi and then tell the outside world that Murong Qi Qi couldn’t take the title of an abandoned wife and committed suicide by hanging. Surely no one would doubt that.</p>
 <p>The viciousness in Murong Xin Lian’s eyes betrayed her inner thoughts. Murong Q Qi smiled and pretended not to know.</p>
 <p>The things that Murong Xin Lian did recently, Su Yue has long reported to her. Just a level three martial arts, a mediocre snake woman. Murong Qi Qi was not one bit worried that she (MXL) could do something to her.</p>
 <p>Based on martial arts, even a little finger from her, Murong Xin Lian would not be able to deal with. Based on venomous, who else in this world would suit that word more than her, Du Xian Er…….</p>
