 <p>Chapter 10: Appointment</p>
 <p>Because of Fei Cui’s words, everyone’s eyes were now directed at her face. Seeing that everyone was believing her now, Fei Cui deliberately raised her head to show everyone the fingerprints on her face.</p>
 <p>On her pale skin, the red fingerprints could be clearly seen. It was just that the two thumbs on the fingerprints were pointing down. With one look, you could tell that she had done it herself.&nbsp; At this point, the servants began to believe Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“It seems that what third miss had said is the truth! Didn’t think that Fei cui is actually such a person! Third miss is already miserable enough, Fei Cui still framed her like this!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, ah! Could it be that second miss is teaching Fei Cui like this in private? She really wants to be Jing <em>wangfei</em>[1. Wangfei: the main wife/consort of the prince of first rank]? The big sister wants to steal the little sister's husband, really shameless, ah!”</p>
 <p>“Even in the presence of third miss, she was saying things like that, really too daring!”</p>
 <p>How could Fei Cui know that when Su Mei slapped her, she already used a trick? And at this moment, seeing everyone talk bad about her, Fei Cui could only look at Murong Xin Lian for help.</p>
 <p>“Miss, it’s really her who beat me!”</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui, kneel!”</p>
 <p>Everyone’s words also went into Murong Xin Lian’s ears. She didn’t think that Fei Cui was so stupid and nearly ruined her plan.</p>
 <p>No matter what, just now everyone had heard Fei Cui say 'rubbish'. At this time, if she didn’t punish Fei Cui, everyone would think that it was her who was behind all of this and made Fei Cui act so arrogant. For her reputation, she could now only throw away the soldier (pawn) and defend the carriage.</p>
 <p>“Second miss…….”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui didn’t know what had happened. Why was there such terrible coldness in Murong Xin Lian’s eyes?</p>
 <p>“Second miss, I’m innocent!”</p>
 <p>“Kneel down! Apologize to third miss!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s clenched fists were hidden in her sleeves. The nails had pierced her delicate arms. This Fei Cui was really unable to accomplish anything but able to spoil everything.</p>
 <p>No matter what had happened today, the image that she’d used so much effort to maintain was now damaged. It seemed that if she wanted to block everyone’s mouth, she must heavily punish Fei Cui.</p>
 <p>“Third miss, Fei Cui was wrong…….”</p>
 <p>Knowing that Murong Xin Lian was angry, Fei Cui stiffly knelt in front of Murong Qi Qi. Although she was dissatisfied, but she had to admit that now she’s in Murong Qi Qi’s hands.</p>
 <p>“Asking third miss to forgive this slave!”</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui, knowing that she was wrong, still did that. Punish her with twenty wooden slaps and deprive her of half-year salary. Third little sister, what do you think?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>In ancient china, while being punished, the guilty one will need to lie down and receive beatings with a thick wooden stick.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to speak, Murong Xin Lian directly said Fei Cui’s punishment.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi looked at this pair of master and servant acting, but she didn’t point it out. Instead she pleaded: “Second big sister, isn’t such a punishment too heavy? On Fei Cui’s body, there are still wounds. Her head is still bleeding. She needs to see a doctor. Moreover, after all, she has followed you for so long. Even if she didn’t make any contributions but she still worked hard……I think, punish with ten wooden slaps. The remaining ten wooden slaps, remembering it is enough. As for the salary, one month is enough. Second big sister , what do you think?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s ‘plea’ was to everyone’s surprise. They originally thought that third miss would not be lenient and would punish Fei Cui heavily. How would they know that she would open her mouth to plea for Fei Cui?</p>
 <p>At this time, the image of third miss immediately rose in everyone’s heart. Twenty wooden slaps on a weak girl, even if she was strong enough to accept it, but she would need to lie down for quite a while. And although half a year salary was not much, but to servants it’s a big part of their income.</p>
 <p>“Third miss really has a good heart!”</p>
 <p>“Right ah. Fei Cui framed third miss. Third miss didn’t hold grudges. She really has a good heart!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s good brought out Murong Xin Lian’s ‘viciousness’. The maid who’d followed her so long, with just one word would be beaten. A comparison between the two misses, who is good and who is bad, the servants of the mansion now made a new assessment.</p>
 <p>“Good, do it according to what little sister has said! When she is back, big sister will surely teach her well!”</p>
 <p>Now Murong Xin Lian hated Murong Qi Qi to death. The truth was what she said. Now the one who opened her mouth to plead was also her. Murong Xin Lian struggled for so long, in the end, just because of some sentences from Murong Qi Qi, everyone had changed their views and even felt that she, this second miss was harsh.</p>
 <p>Endure! Endure! Murong Xin Lian restrained the hate in her heart. She revealed a smile: “Little sister, you must come to admiring the moon at the pavilion tonight, ah! See it as big sister's apology to you. You must give face, ah!”</p>
 <p>“Good! Thanks big sister, little sister will certainly be on time!”</p>
 <p>A farce ended with Fei Cui suffering ten wooden slaps.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>At Ou Xiang <em>yuan</em>[2. Yuan: part of a residence], Fei Cui was lying in bed. She’d just suffered ten wooden slaps. Even moving a bit would be very painful.</p>
 <p>“Miss, this slave, really didn’t say those words. It’s third miss who has framed this slave!”</p>
 <p>“I believe you...”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian personally rubbed medicine for Fei Cui.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t see her for five years, third little sister had actually improved. Fei Cui, rest assured. This hate of today, I will surely get it back for you! Just wait and see! Tonight, I’ll let her regret everything she has done today!”</p>
 <p>Being Murong Xin Lian’s confidante, Fei Cui also knew what she and Zheng Min were planning. Hearing Murong Xin Lian saying that, Fei Cui revealed an ugly smile.</p>
 <p>“Miss, what you said is right.&nbsp; Endure for the time being. After tonight, making it so that she can’t even cry!”</p>
 <p>“Ah...”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui’s words obviously made Murong Xin Lian happy.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi, you wait! After tonight, your reputation will be ruined! The status of Jing <em>wangfei</em> that you were relying on would be a thing of the past. Only I, Murong Xin Lian, am the best candidate to be Jing <em>wangfei</em>. You don’t deserve it!</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Night.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi went to the pavilion. The pavilion was located at the west side of the prime minister's mansion. She didn’t even arrive when she heard a burst of laughter coming from the pavilion. From the noise, Murong Qing Lian’s voice was the loudest: “Big sister Duanmu, is what you said true? Is that demon <em>wang</em>[3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] really so dreadful?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, it’s true. He is cursed and caused the death of his eight wives! I heard that those women had died miserably. They suddenly died on the wedding night and the blood of their bodies had been drained! Everyone said that it’s demon <em>wang</em> who had sucked the blood of the bride. He needs to marry a bride every year to take the fresh blood to maintain his life……”</p>
 <p>“Ah, really frightening, ah!”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, the young maidens in the pavilion exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“Don’t talk about this anymore. Too scary!”</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian saw Murong Qi Qi. She immediately greeted her warmly: “Third little sister, you’ve arrived. Why don’t you come here?! Come, everyone is waiting for you!”</p>
 <p>“Greetings to second big sister!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi let Murong Xin Lian hold her hands and went into the pavilion.</p>
 <p>Aside from Li Yun Qing whom she had already met, the young masters and misses of the four great families were all here. Bai family’s brother and sister, Bai Mu Fei and Bai Yi Yue, Duanmu family’s brother and sister, Duanmu Hong Chen and Duanmu Yi Yi and Shangguan family’s Shangguan Wu Ji. Even Murong household's only son Murong Jun was here.</p>
 <p>It seemed that Murong Xin Lian had a wide range of friends!</p>
 <p>During the five years that Murong Qi Qi had been absent, Murong Xin Lian used much effort to befriend the children of the four great families. Who in the capital didn’t know that Murong household's second miss was an outstanding beauty?</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian was entertaining everyone as though she was Murong household's legitimate miss.</p>
 <p>“Why did you call this ugly duckling here?”</p>
 <p>Murong Jun strongly disapproved of this little sister. The moment he opened his mouth, ‘ugly duckling’ came out.</p>
