 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter 26:&nbsp;Borrowing Somebody Else’s Sword to Kill</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Su Mei’s expression made Murong Xin Lian pause for a bit. She is just a humble little girl, but the cold aura coming from her actually made Murong Xin Lian feel terrified. It’s just that she can’t lose. She can’t back off. She can’t be looked down by Murong Qi Qi this rubbish. She can’t even more not avenge Zheng Min!</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi hid leisurely behind Su Mei, Murong Xin Lian looked down on her even more. When something happens push a servant out to block everything, she Murong Qi Qi is not some good bird!</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian has completely forgotten that the reason all this happened is because the evil in her heart. In the end it caused today’s consequences. She put the blame of all what happened to her on Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“All of you go to hell……,” Murong Xin Lian screamed. The beautiful facial features contorted because of hatred.</p>
 <p>‘Ka……’</p>
 <p>Just as Murong Xin Lian is fantasizing about how the whip will hook around Su Mei’s slender neck and strangle the life out of her, a sound can be heard. The whip has been clamped by Su Mei’s index and middle finger. The whip can’t be moved anymore.</p>
 <p>Impossible! Murong Xin Lian’s expression stiffened. She can’t believe what is happening in front of her. The other party only used two fingers and easily resolved her level three inner energy.</p>
 <p>No, this is impossible! Murong Xin Lian pulled the whip wildly. She wanted to pull it from Su Mei’s fingers. But despite that she used all her energy, the whip still didn’t move.</p>
 <p>Who is this maid? She is obviously just a cheap maid. Why does she know martial arts? And her martial arts are far above hers!</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian looked at the leisurely Murong Qi Qi with a look full of unbelievableness. No wonder she can be so arrogant. At her side, there’s actually a maid with such capability! In the end in what kind of luck did she walk on!</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian thought that Su Mei is just an ordinary maid. She can just bribe her. She immediately changed to a soft expression and threw out the temptation.</p>
 <p>“Miss really have good capabilities, ah! You are so capable; why do you need to stay by her side?! <em>A fine bird chooses a tree to nest in, </em>as long as you leave that rubbish and come to serve me, I assure you, the moment you come, I’ll let you be the head maid and I’ll pay you five <em>liang</em> a month! Moreover, if I marry, you can follow me as a <em>dowry maid</em>! What do you think?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li>Liang: chinese currency&nbsp; (chinese coins). Teals: chinese currency only available in gold and silver</li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>&nbsp;A fine bird chooses a tree to nest in: a talented person chooses a patron of integrity.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>&nbsp;A dowry maid is someone who follow their owner when they marry. They have the chance to become the concubine of their master’s husband. It’s consider a honor because then they can get rid of their status as maid.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Using gain as lure? Murong Qi Qi lazily changed position. With only five <em>liang</em>, she wants to get the allegiance of Su Mei, Moyu’s killer of the fourth rank? Poop must’ve really entered Murong Xin Lian’s head.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Su Mei didn’t speak, Murong Xin Lian thought she is moved, so she continued to ‘guide patiently and systematically’.</p>
 <p>“You see; this rubbish’s reputation is so bad. If you follow her, you won’t have good days in the future. People walk to the higher path, water flows to the downward path. You are still so young. How can you waste your youth on this rubbish? Follow me, I’ll surely give you a whole new life! If you don’t mind, you can call me big sister. In the future we can be sister, what do you think?”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian is calculating with a smile. Having such an expert to follow her, her waist won’t be sour and her legs won’t hurt. Walking will also have more vigor. If she encounters Murong Qing Lian, she doesn’t need to be humble anymore! What is Murong Qi Qi? What this rubbish can give, she can also give. Moreover the conditions are more generous than Murong Qi Qi’s! She doesn’t believe that throwing such a ‘generous’ treatment, Su Mei will not be tempted.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s ‘believing in herself infallible’ once again reached a high level. Su Mei saw her beautiful face, her (SM) mouth revealed a mocking smile.</p>
 <p>“Five <em>liang</em>? Dowry maid? Sisters? Murong Xin Lian, why don’t you look at the mirror! Who do you think you are?! I’ll tell you, even a strand of your hair can’t be compared to our miss! Even if you give me ten thousand golden <em>taels</em>, I won’t be following you. Because, you don’t deserve……”</p>
 <p>“You, you……”</p>
 <p>Being rejected by Su Mei and the words are so ugly to hear, it’s like she has been slapped in the face in public. Moreover, it’s in front of this rubbish Murong Qi Qi. Murong Xin Lian’s face immediately turned black.</p>
 <p>“Bitch, don’t be unable to tell the good from the bad!”</p>
 <p>“The one who can’t tell good from bad is you!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei contemplated coldly. She grabbed the whip and threw Murong Xin Lian in the air.</p>
 <p>‘Pa, pa, pa……’</p>
 <p>The whip broke into parts long like a thumb.</p>
 <p>“Go!”</p>
 <p>With Su Mei’s light command, the broken parts of the whip flew into the air like rain and hit hard on Murong Xin Lian’s body.</p>
 <p>“A……”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian felt pain. She lost balance. She fell from the air and smashed straight onto the ground.</p>
 <p>“Miss, miss how are you?”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui heard sounds, she immediately rushed to Murong Xin Lian’s side and helped her up.</p>
 <p>“Miss, are you injured?”</p>
 <p>“Go away!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian has never been so embarrassed. The other party is just a cheap maid. She actually dares to humiliate her like this!</p>
 <p>Looking a Fei Cui in front of her and thinking about the maid beside Murong Qi Qi, comparing them, Fei Cui is just a useless thing. Thinking till here, Murong Xin Lian got a towering rage. She slapped Fei Cui’s face.</p>
 <p>“Go away!”</p>
 <p>“Miss……”</p>
 <p>Receiving a slap in the face without reason, Fei Cui felt very wronged. She didn’t do anything, why did miss slap her?</p>
 <p>“Second big sisteryou yourself are useless. Why take it out on the people by your side?! After all, Fei Cui is someone who came from my side. You slapping her, is it not like slapping my face?! Yo, look, this small face is so aggrieved.&nbsp; Really pitiful!”</p>
 <p>Don’t know when, Murong Qi Qi also has come to ground. Seeing the scene of Fei Cui being slapped, Murong Qi Qi chuckled loudly.</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui, why don’t you come back at my side?! I’ll let you be the head maid. Your salary will rise to five <em>liang </em>a month. When I get married, you will be my dowry maid. When you go over with me, you can be a concubine, won’t it be really good?! People walk to a higher path, water flow to the downward path. If you come back, I can let bygones be bygones.”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui knows that Murong Qi Qi is trying to drive a wedge. She immediately looked at Murong Xin Lan. She hoped that Murong Xin Lian will understand that she never has such a thought. But the furious Murong Xin Lian, although knowing that Murong Qi Qi is just giving her back the words she said, but the anger in her heart still can’t be quelled. She need to vent.</p>
 <p>‘Pa pa!’</p>
 <p>Again two slaps. Fei Cui’s cheek immediately turned red. Seeing that blood appeared on her mouth, presumably some teeth must’ve been broken. No wonder, Murong Xin Lian is still in the stage where she is using her inner energy. The force of the slap is ten times from that of usual.</p>
 <p>“Zeze ze! Second big sister has a really hard heart, ah! Fei Cui, you must feel wronged! If it wasn’t because you told me second big sister’s plan, the one who is causing hysteria today will be me. Don’t worry, I know how to pay the debt of gratitude. Fei Cui, as long as you nod, even if I have an acrimonious falling out, I will get you back!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi looked with sympathy at Fei Cui. That expression looked like she is really feeling heartache for Fei Cui.</p>
 <p>“Third miss, what, what are you talking about……”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui shook her head and looked with a look of disbelief. What telling her second miss’s plan? She didn’t say anything, ah! Murong Qi Qi obviously wants to borrow somebody’s else’s sword to kill!</p>
 <p>After Fei Cui understood this, her face paled.</p>
 <p>“Second miss, this slave didn’t betray you. You must believe this slave!”</p>
