 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 150 (Part 1) The horror scene at the imperial garden</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>One side was the throne that Wanyan Yi wanted. The other side was the woman he cared about.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Yi already knew how to choose between the two. He needed to get Murong Qi Qi and then through Murong Qi Qi become the crown prince. However, why did his heart felt sour after seeing Xia Yun Xi’s behavior?! He wasn’t willing to see the woman he loves become another’s woman with his own eyes. Why couldn't he get the country and the beauty at the same time?!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Yi’s heart suddenly moved. That’s right, ah! He must have both the country and the beauty! What between the fish and the bear’s paw, you can have only one. He didn’t believe it. He wanted both!</p>
 <p>On the scene, the songs and dances were soaring. The dancers twisted and turned their waists. Coupled with wonderful music, they attracted everyone’s eyes. No one noticed people left their seats and no one noticed what they went to do after leaving their seats.</p>
 <p>“Cang, the good play is about to begin.” Murong Qi Qi sipped wine. It was still such wine that had a good taste.</p>
 <p>“What did Qing Qing do to them? Why was it like these two people lost their souls just now? They actually took the wine in our hands and drank it?” The thought of just now, Wanyan Yi and Xia Yun Xi took the wine in their hands and drank the wine with the drug, Feng Cang felt that Murong Qi Qi was very mystical.</p>
 <p>She only just looked at the other party’s eyes once and was able to exchange the drugged wine with the other party. What was this trick called? Could it also be a trick from Moyu?</p>
 <p>“Mysteries of the heaven must not be revealed!” Murong Qi Qi smiled slightly and continued to sip wine, “These two people calculated us like that, why don’t I help their aim?!”</p>
 <p>“Haha…,” Murong Qi Qi didn’t say, Feng Cang also didn’t continue to ask. He didn’t know what will happen later. Feng Cang intended on enjoying it with Murong Qi Qi!</p>
 <p>While Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang were talking, Ming Yue Cheng stepped on his clogs and came over. He didn’t bother about trifles and sat next to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Should I call you Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>now or call you princess Zheng Guo?”</p>
 <p>Staring at this dream-like face, Ming Yue Cheng’s eyes were slightly drunk. In his hand, he held a wine cup. He asked this, Murong Qi Qi chuckled and poured wine for Ming Yue Cheng, “No matter if it’s Guanghua <em>gongzi </em>or princess Zhen Guo, aren’t they still me?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha!” Murong Qi Qi’s answer made Ming Yue Cheng laugh heartily. After laughing, he gulped the wine down at once, “Feng Qi Qi, I like you! Do you still remember the things I said on the day you left Xi Liang?”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng’s words let Murong Qi Qi remember the time when she left, this person chased after her and handed her a wine jar. It was just, the youth was in love, but the girl didn’t have the heart.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your love…I already have someone I love. Presumably, I would let you go back alone!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words let Ming Yue Cheng’s beautiful eyes turn dark. Sure enough…</p>
 <p>“Is it that I came late?” Ming Yue Cheng looked under the table at Feng Cang’s hand that held Murong Qi Qi tightly. His voice had a bitter taste, “If I dealt sooner with the matters of Nan Feng, would I not have missed this love?”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng’s words fell on Feng Cang’s ears. Although, he was jealous, but it also let Feng Cang got to know this man. Sure enough, it was as Murong Qi Qi said. He’s a straightforward and upright person. Daring to speak like this with Murong Qi Qi in front of him (FC), he (MYC) must be a magnanimous gentleman.</p>
 <p>“Ming Yue Cheng, we’re still friends!” Murong Qi Qi once again filled Ming Yue Cheng’s cup with wine, “This has nothing to do with sooner or later. It was only, at the right time, I met the right person. You didn’t do anything wrong…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words were full of the taste of Buddha’s meditation. Ming Yue Cheng stared at her for a long time. He wanted to see a glimmer of hope from this woman’s eyes. So, he could have a reason to persist. However, that piece of clear lake was clean through the bottom. It didn’t have the thing Ming Yue Cheng wanted.</p>
 <p>“I understand.” Ming Yue Cheng sighed. The gaze he looked at Murong Qi Qi with was full of fondness and reluctance to part with (her). Perhaps, Murong Qi Qi was right. He didn’t come late. It was just that they didn’t have the fate to continue.</p>
 <p>However, he wasn’t resigned to let go. But, after seeing Feng Cang’s and Murong Qi Qi’s intertwined finger, he also understood. The two used action to show their attitude. <em>A melon broken off the vine by force won’t taste sweet</em>. A forced relationship is not love. He understood this principle.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>A melon broken off the vine by force won’t taste sweet: if it’s not meant to be, it’s no use trying to force it to happen</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Feng Qi Qi, if one day, he betrays you, my Nan Feng’s door will always be open for you. Besides, my position of empress would always be yours!”</p>
 <p>After throwing these words, Ming Yue Cheng once again drank the wine in the cup at once. He looked at Feng Cang, “Remember, if you betray her, even if it’s against her wishes, I will take her away and take good care of her!”</p>
 <p>“I won’t let you have such a chance.”</p>
 <p>“Ha, then it’s the best!” Ming Yue Cheng stood up and looked once more at Murong Qi Qi. He revealed a bright smile, “Qi Qi, you must be happy, yo!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Ming Yue Cheng turned. He left the sight of the two people without turning back.</p>
 <p>This person made Feng Cang feel surprised. He also understood a bit about the matters of Ming Yue Cheng. This man is not someone without a particular talent. Now, he was able to become the new emperor of Nan Feng, he also suffered greatly and experienced a lot of hardships. He gave up on Murong Qi Qi so ‘easily’ made Feng Cang in disbelief. He thought that Ming Yue Cheng would fight at least a bit more.</p>
 <p>“He’s a good man!” After being silent for a while, Feng Cang gave Ming Yue Cheng a clear evaluation.</p>
 <p>“Mm! Otherwise, I wouldn’t have helped him!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t have any feelings towards Ming Yue Cheng. She only felt that this man endured humiliation as part of an important mission. He was worthy of admiration. As for developing feelings with him, she never thought about such a thing. Now, she already has Feng Cang. Her eyes, her heart, couldn’t tolerate anyone else.</p>
 <p>“He is being like this made me feel a pressure I never felt before. It seemed that I must be good to you. Qing Qing gave up on Nan Feng’s position of empress and choose to be with me…”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s beautiful eyes were full of smiles. The gaze he looked at Murong Qi Q also became more affectionate, “This man said to let go, but in fact he’s waiting for me to slack off and gave him the opportunity that he can exploit. This advancing by retreating would be great when used in the military, but it would not be any use on me. Because, I will never give him such an opportunity! Let his position of empress stay empty forever!”</p>
 <p>“You, ah. Are you so sure that I’m dead set on you?”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s you who is sure of me…”</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>The two were affectionate, didn’t pay attention to the scene and also didn’t know when the dancers had left. When they recovered their posture, in the center stood two people. To be exact, it was one person standing. The other sat in a wheelchair.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi knew one of them. It was Jia Lan who she saw on the tournament of the four countries. As for the other one, he introduced himself, “I’m the 19<sup>th</sup> generation descendant of Penglai Island and the eldest disciple Misha. He’s my junior brother Jia Lan.”</p>
 <p>It turned out that these two people were from Penglai Island! When the people heard that they were related to Penglai Island, they couldn’t help but look at the two men.</p>
 <p>Jia Lan was still dressed elegantly in blue and Misha was only dressed in brown colored rough clothes. However, these brown clothes on his body didn’t diminish his aura. Instead it gave him an aura of an immortal scattered outside of the world.</p>
 <p>Different from the masculinity of Jia Lan, Misha looked like a young cute boy. Fair, smooth and tender skin, handsome and slender eyebrows, deep and smiling eyes, pink and soft lips: he was a hundred percent living cute young boy.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie was a bit surprised that Penglai Island’s people came to Bei Zhou, “Don’t know why the two of you came to our country?”</p>
 <p>“I came to find a person!” Misha’s voice was also very youthful. Coupled with that cute face of his, he was very lovable. There was a feeling suitable for young and old.</p>
 <p>“Oh, who is the person young master Misha is looking for?”</p>
 <p>“Murong Qing Lian!”</p>
 <p>Hearing this name, Wanyan Lie froze for a moment. This name sounded very familiar, but he didn’t remember where he had heard it. Jing De saw that Wanyan Lie had long forgotten about Murong Qing Lian, he immediately whispered a few words in his ear. Only now did Wanyan Lie remember that Murong Qing Lian was the woman from the East palace and had been punished by him. He also didn’t know, a hundred times every day for so long, if she was still alive.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qing Lian committed a crime and had been imprisoned by <em>zhen </em>in the prison.”</p>
 <p>The moment he heard that Murong Qing Lian was kept in a prison, Misha’s mood obviously got emotional. Both hands held the handle of the wheelchair. If it wasn’t because there was a problem with his legs, he would’ve certainly got up from excitement, “Your majesty, what crime did Murong Qing Lian commit? She once showed me grace. So, can I ask your majesty to have mercy and sell a favor to me?”</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>To Wanyan Lie, Murong Qing Lian was a little ant who didn’t have any weight. Now, Penglai Island’s eldest disciple said that there was some relation between them, made Wanyan Lie couldn’t help but calculate in his heart. Should he let Murong Qing Lian go and give Misha face?</p>
 <p>“Your majesty, I came all the way just to thank this savior. If she did anything wrong, I’m willing to bear it for her. Asking your majesty to please be generous and let her go. Misha would be very grateful.”</p>
 <p>Misha clapped his hands. Immediately, two people carried two wooden boxes over. Opened it, inside it was full of egg-sized pearls. The two boxes together were a total of twenty pearls.</p>
 <p>“Don’t know if these two boxes of pearls could exchange her life?!”</p>
 <p>The eagerness in Misha’s voice couldn’t help but let people guess about his relationship with Murong Qing Lian. Plus, his sincere tone coupled with that naïve and innocent face, made people stiff heart couldn’t help but go soft.</p>
 <p>“Your majesty, if she’s someone irrelevant, why don’t you let her go?!” Since the moment the boxes were opened, Lin Ke Xin was attracted to these beautiful pearls.</p>
 <p>Such beautiful pearls. Every one of them were full. Besides, they were the size of eggs. How rare were they, ah?! From the first glance, Lin Ke Xin liked the pearls Misha brought. Such pearls, no matter if it was for making jewelry or for grinding it into pearl powder, it was the best. One pearl was already worth a lot of money, not to mention twenty!</p>
 <p>Aside from the pearls, the moment Lin Ke Xin saw Misha, she felt that this child was cute. A man, no matter how cute he was when he was young, but after growing up, he would lose his naivety and ignorance. Only this young man had a baby face. Looking at him, he seemed like a big child, making people couldn’t help but want to love him.</p>
 <p>Lin Ke Xin spoked up for Misha, Wanyan Lie knew that she certainly fancied these pearls. However, these were indeed good pearls. Twenty pearls could exchange Murong Qing Lian’s rotten life. Besides, he could get a favor from Misha. Maybe, there would be a time when he could use it.</p>
 <p>After calculating a bit, Wanyan Lie nodded and ordered Jing De, “Let people go get Murong Qing Lian out!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Jing De also didn’t know if Murong Qing Lian was dead or alive at this moment. If it wasn’t because the appearance of Misha, they would’ve forgotten that such a person had existed. Now, Wanyan Lie nodded and accepted, it could be considered that Murong Qing Lian escaped death and also didn’t need to suffer torture anymore. It was just, he didn’t know if she still had a breath at this moment. He hoped that she was lucky and was able to survive.</p>
 <p>From the beginning to end, Murong Qi Qi didn’t say anything. She didn’t know Misha, but she vaguely felt that this person had something to do with the test at the pagoda. The only thing that let Murong Qi Qi be surprised was that Misha said, once Murong Qing Lian had the grace of saving him.</p>
 <p>According to what Murong Qi Qi knew, from young till now, Murong Qing Lian had been living in Xi Liang and had never left. Misha is Penglai Island’s disciple. Penglai Island had some distance with the mainland. It was inconvenient for his legs to walk. When did he came to Xi Liang and how did he meet Murong Qing Lian?</p>
 <p>Sensing that someone was looking with puzzled eyes at him, Misha turned his face and saw Murong Qi Qi. When he saw that face of Murong Qi Qi, Misha’s eyes were dull. He nodded and smiled slightly at her. In his eyes were no stunning expression. This actually let Murong Qi Qi felt unexpected!</p>
 <p>At least, from the moment she used her real face, there was no one who wouldn’t be surprised when seeing her. Seeing her but wasn’t attracted to her, Misha was the first.</p>
 <p>While waiting for Murong Qing Lian, Wanyan Lie let people put the tables and invited Misha and Jia Lan to take a seat. These two people didn’t care about politeness and was like <em>when you enter a village, follow the local customs</em>. Very quickly, they merged in the banquet. The banquet that was disturbed by them became lively once again.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>When you enter a village, follow the local customs: do as the natives do</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>After a long time, two people brought Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian once again, Murong Qi Qi almost didn’t recognize her. Messy hair and dirty face. She was dressed in blood soaked clothes. Besides, the blood seemed to have dried up for a long time and became dark red.</p>
 <p>“Your majesty, the person is brought!” Jing De went to behind Wanyan Lie and whispered.</p>
 <p>“Young master Misha, you can take a look. Is she the person you’re looking for?”</p>
 <p>Misha seemed a bit excited. He wanted to turn the wheel and push himself to Murong Qing Lian. However, because of excitement, his hand touched for a few times, but didn’t touch the wheel. In the end, it was Jia Lan who pushed him to Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“Jia Lan, is it her?” Misha’s voice trembled slightly.</p>
 <p>Misha had never seen Murong Qing Lian, so he couldn’t distinguish her. After Jia Lan heard Misha, he squatted, lowered his head and looked at Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“Don’t beat me! Don’t beat me!” Not waiting for Jia Lan to be near her, Murong Qing Lian’s hands supported herself and backed two steps. The loose hair, because it wasn’t cleaned for a long time, they became locked to each other and exuded a stench. In the hair were also some straws that only the prison could have.</p>
 <p>The original beautiful eyes of Murong Qing Lian were no longer full of confidence. Instead, they were filled with fear and dread. She seemed particularly afraid to see people. So, when she saw Misha and Jia Lan, her whole body trembled and she wanted to escape the two people.</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian used her hand to push the ground and backed. Misha discovered that her legs had been destroyed with beating. The original slender legs, lay now clumsily on the ground. The fabric of the pants was very thin and revealed all the purple whip marks. There were some places that were very swollen, infected and revealed yellow and red pus.</p>
 <p>She seemed that she didn’t feel any pain or maybe she was already numb from pain. In Murong Qing Lian’s point of view, these pains were nothing. The only thing that let her be afraid was the so many people as well as the two men in front of her.</p>
 <p>“She’s Murong Qing Lian.” Jia Lan didn’t expect that he didn’t see her just in a few months, the originally proud girl became like this. What happened on Murong Qing Lian’s body? Why did she become like this?</p>
 <p>Such a Murong Qing Lian made Misha’s heart ache. He slowly came to Murong Qing Lian and reached out his right hand. The pair of beautiful eyes showed countless of remorse and repentance.</p>
 <p>“Lian, don’t be afraid! Big brother has come!”</p>
