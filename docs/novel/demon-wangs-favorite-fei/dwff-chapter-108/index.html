 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 108 Annoying in the extreme father and son (2)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhou had immersed herself in self-blame and Wanyan Hong’s mouth repeatedly bit Wanyan Bao Zhu’s ear, making her scream from pain.</p>
 <p>“If you continue to not concentrate, this crown prince would punish you!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong smiled evilly. The coldness in his eyes turned stronger.</p>
 <p>“Obediently obey this crown prince, little sister. This crown prince would help you achieve your wish! Otherwise, this crown prince wouldn’t mind letting you, this beauty,&nbsp;<em>diminish your fragrance and let the jade perish</em>.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>The fragrance diminished and the jade perished: death of a pretty woman; a beauty passed away</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong already said it like this, Wanyan Bao Zhu could no longer escape.</p>
 <p>Die or meet Wanyan Hong’s needs. She didn’t want to die. She was timid, afraid and still had hatred that she hadn't yet avenged. So, she couldn’t die! The thought of revenge made Wanyan Bao Zhu hate Murong Qi Qi even more. All was because of that woman. That woman brought calamity to her! All her humiliation was thanks to Murong Qi Qi. She must avenge this hatred!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu was no longer so reserved. Her body snuggled on Wanyan Hong’s body.</p>
 <p>“Imperial big brother, what are you saying? I’m so afraid, oh! Don’t scare people like this!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu seemed to have changed into another person. Her seductive expression, coupled with that whiny voice and also those eyes full of temptation, made Wanyan Hong very impulsive.</p>
 <p>“Coquettish bitches truly are great!”</p>
 <p>“Hateful!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu took the initiative to undress Wanyan Hong. She bit his collarbone and gently sucked. Her mouth also made satisfied sounds, making Wanyan Hong’s desire immediately rise.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong never tasted such a passionate and hot woman like Wanyan Bao Zhu. It was as if her lips had magic and lit a series of flames on his body. Besides, when he saw that face of Wanyan Bao Zhu, Wanyan Hong became even more impulsive. He wished he could have her now, but he didn’t expect that he would be stopped by Wanyan Bao Zhu just when he was about to reach his goal.</p>
 <p>“Imperial big brother, if I listen to you obediently, would imperial big brother really protect me? However, outside, there are a few people I truly don’t like, what to do now?”</p>
 <p>“This crown prince would help you!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong panted. This fox, she wanted to press him to death. At this moment, she was still pulling out some unimportant things as if she deliberately wanted to make things difficult for him! Hateful!</p>
 <p>When she heard Wanyan Hong’s promise, Wanyan Bao Zhu smiled seductively. However, she didn’t expect that she'd angered Wanyan Hong. He recklessly turned her over.</p>
 <p>“Ah…”</p>
 <p>When she felt the pain, Wanyan Bao Zhu’s nails dug in her palms. This man is really a pervert! He actually greeted her chrysanthemum!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Chrysanthemum is slang for anus</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was completely speechless! Now, she had a clear understanding of Wanyan Hong’s taste!</p>
 <p>If next time, someone asks what the crown prince of the East palace likes, she would answer chrysanthemum without a doubt. However, now she wasn’t in the mood to joke. The pain coming from there made her couldn’t help but want to escape. However, Wanyan Hong’s hands clutched her tightly, making her unable to move.</p>
 <p>“Pain!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s tears fell down and Wanyan Hong humphed with satisfaction. The two’s shadows overlaid each other. The actions of the figure standing behind was very big. A drop of blood fell on the ground. It was dark and red like a virgin’s blood.</p>
 <p>This torture continued till the middle of the night. Wanyan Bao Zhu didn’t know how many times she had been bullied. When Wanyan Hong truly left her, her legs went soft and fell on the ground. Pain spread from there making her couldn’t help but exhale from discomfort. Why was it her who was always injured? Why?</p>
 <p>In contrast to Wanyan Bao Zhu, Wanyan Hong was satisfied like never before. He had never experienced such happiness. Whether it was men or women, none of them gave him such a wonderful feeling.</p>
 <p>Remembering the soaring on the cloud and sailing on mist feeling which made him feel as if he was flying, Wanyan Hong’s big palm slapped Wanyan Bao Zhu’s butt.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, tsk, it seems that it was the first time for you! Not bad! This crown prince likes it!”</p>
 <p>After hearing Wanyan Hong, Wanyan Bao Zhu wished to hit herself on the wall. He actually stared without any scruple at there. She felt very shameful. Wanyan Bao Zhu struggled to stand up. She used her dress to cover herself. Wanyan Hong didn’t object. Instead, he looked smilingly at how she dressed herself as if he was appreciating a piece of art.</p>
 <p>When Wanyan Bao Zhu was dressed neatly, Wanyan Hong threw a porcelain bottle at her.</p>
 <p>“When you go back, apply it. It was the first time, so presumably it teared. When you go back, apply some medicine to avoid the pain. Don’t worry, next time, this crown prince wouldn’t be so rude and would definitely be very gentle. This thing, you will like it if you do it more. In the future, you won’t feel pain like today!”</p>
 <p>There’s still in the future?! Wanyan Bao Zhu truly wanted to die. Originally, she thought there was only one time. She didn’t expect that this pervert still want to do it in the future. Didn’t this mean that she could never escape him?</p>
 <p>As if seeing the grayness in Wanyan Bao Zhu’s eyes, Wanyan Hong went to her. His big hand grabbed her waist. The pain made Wanyan Bao Zhu wake up. Then her eyes met Wanyan Hong’s gloomy eyes.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think of escaping! Even if you grew wings, this crown prince will break them!”</p>
 <p>“Your high…imperial big brother, I never thought of escaping.”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu already had a profound understanding of Wanyan Hong’s personality. Towards such a pervert, she could only go along with him first and wait till she could find an opportunity to escape. Now, she doesn’t have any power to contend him. She could only go along with him.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Wanyan Bao Zhu had a clear view of how things are, Wanyan Hong’s mood turned slightly better.</p>
 <p>“From now on, you should be available any time this crown prince calls. As long as this crown prince calls you, no matter where you are or what you’re doing, you must come immediately! Do you understand?!”</p>
 <p>“I understand, I understand.”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu carefully nodded. The pain on her waist stimulated her. Why did this man like to pinch someone’s waist? Could it be that he didn’t know it would hurt?</p>
 <p>“Alright, now tell this crown prince, who do you hate? This crown prince will help you get rid of him/her!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong loosened his hand and tightly hugged Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>“Say, who provoked this crown prince’s most beloved little sister?”</p>
 <p>“It’s…”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu originally wanted to say Murong Qi Qi; however, now she thought about it, the only thing that could save her was the marriage to Longze Jing Tian. However, even a fool knew what kind of attitude Murong Qing Lian had towards Longze Jing Tian. Let’s first begin with Murong Qing Lian! After clearing all obstacles and marrying Longze Jing Tian, she would finally get away from Wanyan Hong, this pervert!</p>
 <p>“Xi Qi’s Murong Qing Lian!”</p>
 <p>“Murong Qing Lian? Ah, this crown prince knows. How do you want to do it? Directly kill her or…”</p>
 <p>Of course, Wanyan Bao Zhu was willing to let Murong Qing Lian die. However, her dying wouldn’t solve many problems. If she could let Wanyan Hong transfer his target to Murong Qing Lian, how great would that be? In that case, she wouldn’t have to bear the pain of the body anymore! And she also can be together with Longze Jing Tian!</p>
 <p>After determining her thoughts, Wanyan Bao Zhu snuggled in Wanyan Hong’s arms.</p>
 <p>“Imperial big brother, Murong Qing Lian is a little pretty beauty. Beauties come from Murong family. Now, Murong Qing Lian is also very famous in Xi Liang (<em>capital of Xi Qi</em>). Why don’t imperial big brother take her into your palace and enjoy her?”</p>
 <p>How could Wanyan Bao Zhu know that Wanyan Hong had long heard from Zhao Lang that her identity was Murong <em>fu</em>’s second miss Murong Xin Lian. Now, seeing her push her little sister out, Wanyan Hong had of course guessed what she was really thinking.</p>
 <p>It was just, <em>the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</em> Wanyan Bao Zhu only wanted to let Wanyan Hong get Murong Qing Lian, so he would change his target and let herself get free. How could she know that Wanyan Hong wanted to kill two birds with one stone; to let this pair of sisters stay with him!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind: pursue a narrow gain while neglecting a greater danger</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“No problem. No matter what you want to do, this crown prince will go along. Who let you be this crown prince's most beloved little sister?!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was happy with Wanyan Hong’s words. She thought that she was one step closer to her plan. Just as she was secretly feeling proud, a cold spread through her body. She didn’t know when the clothes on her body had been undressed by Wanyan Hong.</p>
 <p>“Imperial big brother…”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Wanyan Bao Zhu to understand, once again the pain came. The wound from before, once again met a fierce force. She wanted to beg for mercy, but her head was pressed fiercely on the table by Wanyan Hong. Tears made the black hair, which hung loosely on the table, wet. This demon, this pervert! Wanyan Bao Zhu could only curse Wanyan Hong in her heart! However, all this hate and curses couldn’t change her current situation. She passed this night very sorrowfully…</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s and Murong Qi Qi’s wedding was set on the twenty-eight day of the first month. After Feng Cang came back, this news was spread out. After one night, everyone in the capital knew that demon <em>wang</em>[1. Wang/wangye: prince of first rank] was getting married again. Immediately, Yan Capital soared. Everyone was talking about Feng Cang’s ninth bride.</p>
 <p>“Miss, just now, the bets were flying everywhere outside. Everyone was betting that you wouldn’t live past the wedding night.”</p>
 <p>Su Yue peeled the walnut and put it in front of Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“The gambling dens once again began to set bets!”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Murong Qi Qi yawned lazily. “Did you get the money that I won before? How much is it?”</p>
 <p>The moment they heard Murong Qi Qi mention the money, Su Mei and Su Yue laughed. Those fools bet that Bei Zhou would lose! Ah, why didn’t they look at what kind of person their miss is?!</p>
 <p>“The bet multiplied six times! Thirty million! Miss, you didn’t see Wu Qing. When he was counting the money, he couldn’t close his mouth from laughing. He even said that next time, when encountering such a great thing, he also wants to follow along and bet!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>In c74,</em>&nbsp;<em>Guanghua gongzi betted five million silver teals that Bei Zhou would win</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Su Mei described Wu Qing’s expression. The three girls laughed happily.</p>
 <p>“Did you found the person who bet ten million? Who is he/she?”</p>
 <p>“It’s someone from Fo Sheng Men.”</p>
 <p>Su Mei was surprised for a moment and told the result of Wu Qing’s investigation to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Fo Sheng Men?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s beautiful brow frowned. Eventually, it turned back to normal.</p>
 <p>“It seems that Long Ao Tian has brains. This time, he has earned sixty million!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, ah, miss! Now, everyone at the gambling dens are betting that you won’t live past the wedding night, but Long Ao Tian’s people once again bet ten million, betting that you will survive the wedding night!”</p>
 <p>Now, Murong Qi Qi became interested. She sat up and repeatedly thought about the issues of Long Ao Tian.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that he knows my identity?”</p>
 <p>“How could that be?! Aside from our people, no one would know miss’s identity. Our own people won’t tell anyone. Long Ao Tian’s news couldn’t be so fast and abundant!”</p>
 <p>Now, Murong Qi Qi felt it was strange. Since, her identity wasn’t exposed, then why would the leader of Fo Sheng Men repeatedly bet on her? Could it be that he predicted or did he bet according to his mood? Really strange!</p>
 <p>She didn’t understand the reason so Murong Qi Qi simply changed into clothes to travel. She left Tingsong building, left <em>wangfu</em>[2. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first-rank] and went shopping.</p>
 <p>She didn’t know what Feng Cang had been doing these past two days. He was so secretive. He didn’t say and she was too lazy to ask. She just happened to have some free time to go shopping. Murong Qi Qi took Su Mei and Su Yue for a walk in Yan Capital.</p>
 <p>“Miss, the ‘Spell of Fragrance’ Tong Bao Zhai recently launched is selling very well! Recently, Fang Kui counted so much money, his hands lost strength. He also said, if miss has time to let miss design the new jewelries. Many imperial relatives and wives of officials have already placed orders!”</p>
 <p>While walking, Su Yue reported everything about Tong Bao Zhai and Jue Se Fang to Murong Qi Qi. Murong Qi Qi was happy to hear that the businesses were going well. Now, the thing they lacked to build the number one place of business was money. Every day, they needed to spend a lot of money because Moyu had so many people. If she didn’t have income, then the businesses wouldn't be able to run.</p>
 <p>“Alright! When I have time, I’ll design a set. Recently, I've had some ideas.”</p>
 <p>While talking, Murong Qi Qi’s group arrived at the street in Yan Capital where the gambling dens were located. They'd just arrived when they heard the shouting, the sound of dices, the laughter, and the crying of people who wished to die.</p>
 <p>“Come, come, come! Bet! Bet if Nan Lin <em>wangfei</em>[3. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank] could live till the twenty ninth! Take a bet, take a bet! It’s definitely cost-effective! Can the ninth bride pass the wedding night safely? Would the curse once again descend? Customers, it’s better to take action than to be moved. Did you already bet today?”</p>
 <p>“Really too much!!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei wanted to go teach the servant of the gambling den a lesson, but was stopped by Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Su Yue, go ask how many people have betted that I’ll win?!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi stood on the street. With narrowed eyes, she looked at the famous gambling street of the capital. This territory is excellent. It would be best if she could get it.</p>
 <p>Not long after, Su Yue returned.</p>
 <p>“Miss, aside from Long Ao Tian, no one else betted that you'd win.”</p>
 <p>“Let them bet! The bigger the odds, the more money we can make. Tell Wu Qing, take hundred thousand golden teals. Tell him to bet on the last day just before they close. I want the people of this street to lose even their pants!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi saying this, made Su Yue and Su Mei exchange a smile. Miss was angry. Angering miss would lead to an ugly fate. Hundred thousand golden teals, according to the current odds, would make them bankrupt. The three were just about to leave, and didn’t expect to meet three familiar people… Yu Shi Shi, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>“Yo, so coincidentally!” The moment Yu Shi Shi saw Murong Qi Qi, she smiled. The gentleness showed on her face was so fake, making people feel disgusted.</p>
 <p>“Princess is also taking a stroll, ah?!”</p>
 <p>“That’s great, ah. Take a stroll to see what new things have happened recently.”</p>
 <p>If Murong Qi Qi say she’s second at playing innocent, then no one would be first. Before, Yu Shi Shi was put in house arrest for a month. The time had passed. Now that she was out, naturally she should pretend to accompany Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, there are many new things. However, recently everyone was talking about Nan Lin <em>wang’s </em>wedding.”</p>
 <p>Yu Shi Shi pretended to look sympathetically at Murong Qi Qi. Her eyes seemed to be full of worries for this princess who came to marry so far away.</p>
 <p>“Ai, don’t know if princess has heard. Everyone is saying that you won’t live past the wedding night!”</p>
 <p>“I’ve heard.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi generously said her inner thoughts. Yu Shi Shi was very surprised. She exchanged a glance with Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yue Die. The two walked to Murong Qi Qi with a ‘so pitiful’ expression. They looked full of sympathy at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Princess, there are some words I don’t know if I should or shouldn’t say.”</p>
 <p>“Let out…,” seeing that Yu Shi Shi wanted to pretend again, Murong Qi Qi felt a little evil.</p>
 <p>“Let out what?” Yu Shi Shi was surprised for a moment.</p>
 <p>“If you have something to say, say it quickly. If you need to fart, then let it out quickly!” Murong Qi Qi dug in her ears. “Crown princess, talk quickly, I still need to go to Jue Se Fang to buy things!”</p>
 <p>That Murong Qi Qi didn’t give her face like this, made Yu Shi Shi’s expression turn a bit ugly. However, she had also heard about Murong Qi Qi's actions at the tournament of the four countries. Now, it’s the momentum of the other party. Yu Shi Shi wouldn't go head to head with her.</p>
 <p>Yu Shi Shi looked at the somewhat shy Mu Yu Die and cleared her throat, “Princess, Nan Lin <em>wang’s </em> <em>eight character</em> is strong. If princess’s body is weak, wouldn’t you be like the previous few <em>wangfeis</em>? I've heard, if two women enter the family at the same time when meeting with someone with a strong life, then the evil spirits would be resolved. Why don’t princess consider letting <em>wangye</em> take a concubine. By then, there are two concurrent, happy events in the family, make something perfect even more perfect. So great!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Eight characters: </em><em>representing the year, month, day, and hour of one's birth</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Lull! Murong Qi Qi almost swore at Yu Shi Shi. What kind of thing, ah?! She (MQQ) hadn’t married yet, but she (YSS) was already thinking to get second wives for Feng Cang. This woman really deserved a good spanking!</p>
 <p>Although Murong Qi Qi was thinking like that in her heart, but on the surface, she remained calm.</p>
 <p>“You say this, presumably you already have someone in mind. It’s just don’t know who is the wonderful person crown princess is talking about.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like that, Yu Shi Shi lightly scoffed in her heart. Didn’t she (MQQ) show a very loving appearance with Feng Cang before? However, she (YSS) didn’t reach her goal yet, so Yu Shi Shi wouldn’t show her feelings on her face. She smilingly pushed Mu Yu Die in front of Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Princess, what do you think of miss Mu? The prime minister let people calculate. Miss Mu and <em>wangye’s </em>eight characters truly are a match. If she can make an alliance with <em>wangye</em>, she would certainly give prosperity to the husband and also princess!”</p>
 <p>Prosper your mother! If it wasn’t because Su Yue was holding her back, Su Mei would’ve long sent Yu Shi Shi flying with a kick. Really, a group of bitches! Miss hadn’t married yet, but they had already sharpened their mind to drill around <em>wangfu</em>. What kind of things do these people think they are?!</p>
 <p>“Miss Mu also thinks so?” Murong Qi Qi looked at Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>Although before at Yongzhou, Mu Yu Die was frightened and was somewhat silly. However, she slowly recovered her mind. It was just, she sealed away that horrible memory and she turned back to how she was before.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi asked her, Mu Yu Die shyly nodded.</p>
 <p>She wasn’t afraid about this matter. Grandfather said he would support all her decisions. If they go with the emperor’s decree, even if Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi object, it wouldn’t have an effect. Now, Mu Yu Die was set on marrying Feng Cang. She had waited till she's twenty for this man; she’s almost becoming the joke of Yan Capital. If she couldn’t marry Feng Cang, then she could only die!</p>
 <p>Seeing the blush on Mu Yu Die’s face which had a thick spring taste, Murong Qi Qi suddenly remembered something. Her mouth revealed a sweet smile.</p>
 <p>“That would be great, ah! If miss Mu enters the family and can get rid of the killing aura on <em>wangye</em>, it would be the best. I would also get one more sister and would also have a place to drop by!”</p>
 <p>“Princess, you agreed?” Hearing the tone of Murong Qi Qi, Mu Yu Die was very excited.</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die knew the place Murong Qi Qi had in Feng Cang’s heart. There’s a saying: a melon possessed by force is not sweet. If Murong Qi Qi didn’t agree; even if she enters the <em>wangfu</em>, Feng Cang also won’t see her as something. Now Murong Qi Qi had loosened; did this mean that there’s hope for her happiness?</p>
