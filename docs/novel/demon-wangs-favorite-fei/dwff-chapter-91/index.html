 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 91 Shaking the heart moving the soul (1)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qing Lian’s palm to fell on Su Mei’s face, a big hand grabbed Murong Qing Lian’s wrist tightly. Su Mei looked up. It turned out to be Wanyan Kang.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, tsk. Xi Qi’s people are very bold; daring to teach this highness’s person on Bei Zhou’s territory. Very great, ah!”</p>
 <p>On Wanyan Kang’s mouth hung a naughty smile, but his gaze swept sharply over Murong Qing Lian’s face.</p>
 <p>“Don’t know who gave you the right to beat this person!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang’s appearance was outside Su Mei’s expectations, but it was inside Murong Qi Qi’s expectations. Seeing Wanyan Kang being ‘a knight saving the beauty’, Murong Qi Qi remained silent and continued to bandage Bai Yi Yue.</p>
 <p>“Is she not my third big sister’s maid? As long as she came from my Murong household, I can beat her!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian gritted her teeth. Her right hand wanted to be free from Wanyan Kang’s ‘shackles’. However, unexpectedly, the other party’s strength was great. It almost crushed her bones.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian like this, Wanyan Kang sneered. He threw her hand away, making Murong Qing Lian fall onto the ground.</p>
 <p>“Cousin-in-law, why does Murong household&nbsp;have such a woman without brains? Is she really your sister who came from the same mother?”</p>
 <p>“She’s born by a concubine. Originally, concubine Liu was a maid at my mother’s side in charge of the rough work…...,” Murong Qi Qi answered Wanyan Kang very cooperatively.</p>
 <p>“So, it’s like that!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang made an expression as if he had suddenly realized something.</p>
 <p>“Born by a concubine? No wonder she doesn’t have any manners! Seeing cousin-in-law’s every gesture, that's what a model of ladies should be like. This highness thought that every miss of Murong household<em>&nbsp;</em>was like that. Ah, in the end, she came from a concubine. The person is already ugly, I didn’t expect the brain also to be filled with poop. The true master hasn’t spoken yet, but a little silly girl by a servant pretended to be the lady. Really don’t know what kind of teaching that is!”</p>
 <p>Only now did Murong Qi Qi truly gain an insight on Wanyan Kang’s ‘viciousness’. Although, she had a poisonous tongue, but she needed to take many things into consideration and also needed to maintain her image. So, she couldn’t be unrestrained like him. This Wanyan Kang is really funny! How come there’s such a weird prince in Bei Zhou’s imperial family!</p>
 <p>“You, you!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian was so angry that her teeth grinded&nbsp;against each other and made ‘keke’ sounds.</p>
 <p>Because of her outstanding ability, she got Murong Tai’s favors at Murong household. The servants also <em>saw the wind and set the helm.</em> They saw that she got the prime minister’s love, so&nbsp;they all respected her. Never did they treat her differently because she’s from the illegitimate line. Instead, it was Murong Qi Qi, the legitimate miss, who was bullied at the residence. Over time, Murong Qing Lian gradually forgot her origin.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Saw the wind and set the helm: to act pragmatically </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Now, Wanyan Kang repeatedly saying&nbsp;‘born by a concubine’, ‘illegitimate’, ‘a little silly girl by a servant’, made her feel embarrassed like never before. Her face also changed from red to pale, from pale to black. In front of this prince from another country, her pride was&nbsp;trampled on by his foot. Especially, that ‘ugly’, made Murong Qing Lian so angry that tears rolled in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Two number one beauties of the capital came from Murong family. Now, she had been nicknamed ‘little beauty’. How come, she became ‘ugly’ from Wanyan Kang’s point of view?!</p>
 <p>Hearing Wanyan Kang say that Murong Qing Lian was&nbsp;an ‘ugly’ thing, Murong Qi Qi couldn’t help but think back to the first time she had met him. At that time, he had also called her ‘ugly thing’ and pushed her away. This prince truly relied on his identity of being a member of the imperial family to do whatever he pleases, ah! However, such a personality is not bad!</p>
 <p>Seeing the smile on Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian truly got angry. Wanyan Kang was the fifth prince of Bei Zhou, she couldn’t afford to offend him. However, Murong Qi Qi, who she had been bullying for so many years; now, being laughed at&nbsp;by this rubbish, Murong Qing Lian had&nbsp;no way of accepting it.</p>
 <p>“Third big sister, there’s an outsider who is bullying your little sister like this, don’t you need to help? After all, I was born by the same father. He’s talking like this about Murong family’s daughters, could he not also be talking about third big sister, you?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian pointed the gun at her, Murong Qi Qi only smiled. She stuffed the New Lotus in Bai Yi Yue’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Yi Yue, take this medicine. It’s inevitable that in the tournament, there will be bumps and scratches. It’s not good for a girl to leave scars! If you used all, let people come get more!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yi Yue was very touched by Murong Qi Qi’s treatment.</p>
 <p>Now, their relationship was obviously that of competitors. Murong Qi Qi didn’t care about that&nbsp;and also gave her such a valuable medicine. Immediately, Bai Yi Yue bowed at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Thanking princess! Like princess said, knives have no eyes. Princess also needs to be careful! When princess and Nan Lin <em>wang[1. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank]</em>&nbsp;marries, we, Bai household<em>,</em> will certainly send a big gift to repay princess's kindness of today!”</p>
 <p>“Yi Yue, you saying it like that, is like you don’t take me as friend! Good friends don’t need to be like that! When I was being bullied, Yi Yue didn’t look down on me because I’m a rubbish. You didn’t look at me with different eyes. This is already very rare. Between you and me, there’s no need to be so courteous!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi simply ignored her and also treated Bai Yi Yue, who isn’t even her real sister, so well, Murong Qing Lian got furious.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, how come your <em>elbow turns the wrong way</em>?! I’m your real little sister!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Elbow turns the wrong way: favor an outsider instead of someone on one’s own side. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Impudent!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi turned and snapped.</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong[2.Bengong: this palace/ I, used by females of the imperial family]</em> took into consideration that you’re <em>bengong’s </em>illegitimate sister. That’s why I didn’t pursue the matter of you being disrespectful. Today, you've slandered me like this. If it wasn’t because your surname is still Murong, <em>bengong </em>would’ve long not been so polite towards you!”</p>
 <p>“Murong Qing Lian, listen well. From the point of view of relationship, <em>bengong </em>is your legitimate elder sister. There’s order between seniority, there’s difference between legitimate and illegitimate! You’re just an illegitimate daughter born by a concubine. Talking to me like this is already disrespectful. From the point of view of the law, <em>bengong</em> is princess Zhao Yang personally bestowed by the emperor. In front of <em>bengong, </em>you didn’t use the honorific terms, also pointed your fingers at <em>bengong</em> and scolded <em>bengong</em>; all of these actions are very disrespectful!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong </em>took into consideration that you’re young and didn’t bother about it. If you continue to take advantage of that and me giving you face; then if you don’t want face, <em>bengong </em>doesn’t have such a little sister like you! As for those words fifth highness said just now, <em>bengong</em> felt that the lesson was well taught. You should listen well and remember them very well. Don’t go outside the country and let Murong family lose face. Here’s Bei Zhou. There’s no one who will protect you.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s voice revealed a killing intent. The eyes looking at Murong Qing Lian were also cold. Looking at Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian suddenly shuddered. When did she begin to have such an aura? Since when did this rubbish dare to use such a tone to speak?</p>
 <p>Looking at Wanyan Kang and Su Mei’s eyes once again, Murong Qing Lian immediately understood. No wonder this pair of master and servant dared to be so bold. The master seduced Nan Lin <em>wang</em>; the servant tempted the prince’s heart. Behind them, there are people. No wonder they were so full of confidence.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, you have capability. Are you not only relying on Feng Cang’s love? You’re nothing but a lowly thing who seduces men. Even the maid at your side is very coquettish. She even hooked on a prince……”</p>
 <p>‘Pa!’</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qing Lian to finish, a slap fell on her face very hard. The slap was so hard, it made Murong Qing Lian’s head buzz and made her eyes see only&nbsp;stars.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian opened her mouth. A tooth tainted with red blood was spat out. She raised her head. The one who slapped her was actually Longze Jing Tian. At this time, Longze Jing Tian was clenching his fists and glaring at her fiercely. That gaze looked like it wanted to kill her, making Murong Qing Lian freeze on spot.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry! It’s our contestant who was disrespectful. Asking fifth prince and princess Zhao Yang not to get angry!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian bowed at Wanyan Kang and Murong Qi Qi. Him&nbsp;taking action and slapping Murong Qing Lian was because he couldn’t stand Murong Qing Lian slandering Murong Qi Qi like this; secondly, he was also saving Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>Just now, he saw very clearly. If Murong Qing Lian had said one more word, the sword in Wanyan Kang’s hand would've definitely cut off her head. Although Murong Qing Lian indeed went overboard, but now it’s the critical period of the tournament. If they killed Murong Qing Lian now, then the strength of Xi Qi would decline.</p>
 <p>This pagoda that drove away evil spirits was very strange. They didn’t know what was above yet. One more person meant one more helper and also one more chance. So, no matter how Murong Qing Lian acted, Longze Jing Tian would protect her.</p>
 <p>After all, this time’s tournament of the four countries was very important to Longze Jing Tian. Although the voices wanting him to become crown prince of Xi Qi were the highest, but as long as Longze Yu didn’t appoint a crown prince, then his heart wouldn’t be at ease. So, he must further improve his reputation, making Longze Yu couldn’t help but ‘comply with the public opinion’ and pass the throne to him! Only when he's at the highest place, having the empire in his grip, could he get what he wants. For example……the beauty in his heart!</p>
 <p>“Oh……”</p>
 <p>How could Murong Qi Qi not know Longze Jing Tian’s thoughts. He’s <em>advancing by retreating.</em> It looked like he punished Murong Qing Lian, but in fact he had saved her life and retained the strength of Xi Qi. Have to say, this Jing <em>wang </em>is not an easy person to deal with!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Advancing by retreating: compromising</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Count it as if you were lucky. Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was too lazy to continue bother with these things. She stepped on the stone stairs to the second floor.</p>
 <p>“Do you know why <em>benwang[3. Benwang: this king/ I, used by the prince of first rank]&nbsp;</em>slapped you?”</p>
 <p>After the others left, Longze Jing Tian turned and looked sternly at Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“Asking your highness to explain.”</p>
 <p>The&nbsp;previously proud Murong Qing Lian was now with her head down humbly. She swallowed all the blood in her mouth into her stomach.</p>
 <p>“<em>Benwang </em>needs to get the first place. Otherwise, <em>benwang</em> would’ve let them killed you and wouldn’t have saved you. <em>Benwang </em>thinks highly of you. Don’t let <em>benwang </em>be disappointed. By then, don’t end up with the head separated from the body……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian heard the threat in Longze Jing Tian’s voice very well. She also knew that just now, Wanyan Kang had the intention to kill her. If she had continued to speak, today, she would've&nbsp;definitely died here. Moreover, even if she had died, no one would've held Wanyan Kang responsible. Then, she could only be a ghost, full of vengeance.</p>
 <p>It’s just, she was now being taught a lesson in public by Longze Jing Tian. Even if they got the first place, the face she lost wouldn’t come back because of that. Murong Qi Qi is to blame for all of this! All of this were the good things that bitch Murong Qi Qi did!</p>
 <p>“Thanking <em>wangye</em>! Your subject’s daughter will put in my utmost effort!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi’s figure disappear up the stairs, Murong Qing Lian gritted her teeth. She picked up the fallen tooth and hid it close against her body. Murong Qi Qi, you and I can’t exist together!</p>
 <p>The second floor was very quiet. There were no people nor any sounds. The stairs to the third floor was located on the other side. At the top, in the middle, a glowing pearl was placed. It was very bright, making this floor very clear.</p>
 <p>“Is there anybody here?”</p>
 <p>Helan Lian Yi carefully looked around once. Here, there wasn’t even a place for people to hide. Could the second level be so simple?</p>
 <p>“Yo, young master Helan, what you said is strange. Could it be that we’re not anybody?!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang laughed and it was Helan Lian Yi who had a face full of embarrassment after hearing those words.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t mean it like that. What I meant was that no one is hiding in this place. Don’t know if there are any traps or hidden weapons.”</p>
 <p>After experiencing the attack of Dong Lu’s people on the first floor, Bei Zhou still had four people. Xi Qi also still had four people. Three people of Nan Feng had died. Now, they also had four people. Along with the six people of Dong Lu who begged for mercy before, the second floor of this pagoda had a total of eighteen people.</p>
 <p>“Whether or not there are traps or hidden weapons, won’t we know if we try?”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian pushed forward an&nbsp;unlucky Dong Lu person who was standing in the front.</p>
 <p>“Ah…...”</p>
 <p>The miserable voice didn’t completely finish speaking, as&nbsp;the whole body had already been divided into tens of pieces and fell onto the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yi Yue closed her eyes and couldn’t bear to watch such a scene. The others were truly stunned.</p>
 <p>In the air, one after another golden threads appeared in front of everyone because they were now stained with blood. Wanyan Kang wanted to reach out and touch them, but has been stopped by Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Be careful. These are golden silk threads. Don’t touch them!”</p>
 <p>“Golden silk threads!”</p>
 <p>After Murong Qi Qi said that, everyone was stunned again.</p>
 <p>Golden silk thread, as the name suggest, was silk spat out by the golden silkworm. The silk was as sharp as blade. Fire couldn’t burn the silk, sword couldn’t cut the silk. It’s very tough and also extremely sharp. That person of just now, was split into meat pieces because of these gold silk threads.</p>
 <p>“Too shameless!”</p>
 <p>Long Duo began to scold with his peculiar voice.</p>
 <p>“Dong Lu is truly too despicable. This time, they actually used such lowly means! Too shameless.”</p>
 <p>Scolding wouldn’t solve the problem. Li Yun Qing squatted on the ground. He looked carefully at those golden silk thread hanging in the air. He shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Not able to cross over. The whole second floor is layered with golden silk threads.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Li Yun Qing say that they couldn’t cross over, Helan Lian Yi became anxious.</p>
 <p>“Then what should we do? If we can’t cross over, then wouldn’t we be trapped in here?”</p>
 <p>Originally, Murong Qing Lian’s mood was already not good. Now, hearing that, she got very angry. The next moment, she wrapped her soft sword around one of the heads of those Dong Lu’s people.</p>
 <p>“Say, who came up with such a bad idea! Why is your Dong Lu so despicable?! What more are there&nbsp;upstairs?!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know, ah. I really don’t know!”</p>
 <p>This person shook his head very hard.</p>
 <p>“It’s sir Jia Lan who came up with the problem. We only found out after we came in! What more are there&nbsp;upstairs, we truly don’t know, ah!”</p>
 <p>After Murong Qing Lian heard that, she got angry. She wanted to kill this person, but was&nbsp;stopped by Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, what do you want?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian glared at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Before, I already said. No one knows what&nbsp;is upstairs. Leaving them, we can only use them as test subjects. If you kill him, then there will be one less. Could it be that you want to personally go test the top floor?”</p>
 <p>After Murong Qi Qi said that, Murong Qing Lian stopped. Indeed, these Dong Lu’ s people were still useful. Thinking till here, Murong Qing Lian retrieved her soft sword. However, her heart still felt unhappy.</p>
 <p>“You saying so, could it be that you have a way to cross to the other side? If we can’t cross, then everyone loses!”</p>
 <p>“A way……,” Murong Qi Qi smirked. “Of course, I have a way! It’s just, why should I tell you?!”</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>A breath choked in Murong Qing Lian’s throat. She couldn’t spit it out and also couldn’t swallow it. In the end, she still felt angry but swallowed it.</p>
 <p>“Don’t only know how to talk! If you have the ability, then cross over for all of us to see!”</p>
 <p>“Hehe!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi chuckled and didn’t bother anymore with Murong Qing Lian. Instead, she looked carefully at those golden silk threads in the air. The more she looked, the more the smile on her mouth got bigger. Are they not very much like the infrared rays of the future?!</p>
 <p>In the past, she had tried them many times while on training. The most powerful one was when she had stolen the empress’ crown of the Qin palace from the underground treasury of the City Bank. She had passed through three lines of defense. In the end, the alarm didn’t ring.</p>
 <p>Now these, to her, these were just child’s play! It’s just that the infrared rays had been replaced by golden silk threads. If she’s not careful, it wouldn’t be as simple as only being wounded on the surface. She needed to be very careful.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi didn’t say a word for half a day, Wanyan Kang couldn’t hold it in anymore. He came to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Cousin-in-law, did you see any tricks to be used? How should we cross over, ah? Could it be that we use <em>qinggong[4. Qinggong:&nbsp;the ability to move swiftly and lightly at superhuman speed, and perform gravity-defying moves such as gliding on water surfaces, scaling high walls and mounting trees]</em>? However, the roofs are also full of golden silk threads! Moreover, there’s no place around that can be used as a foothold. Even <em>qinggong</em> wouldn’t be easy to use, ah!”</p>
 <p>“Hush……”</p>
 <p>Su Mei made a gesture for him to be silent.</p>
 <p>“Your highness, is my miss not thinking of a way right now?! Could you please not be so noisy?! How come such a big man is acting like a sparrow? Chattering endlessly!”</p>
 <p>“I say, Mei <em>er[7. Er: term of endearment]</em>, could you not treat me in a more amiable manner?! Just now, I was like a hero saving the beauty, ah!”</p>
 <p>“Pei! Who wanted that?! This miss could also settle it!”</p>
 <p>“Mei <em>er</em>, women need to be more gentle! Look at how gentle and pleasant your miss is. You should learn more from her!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Kang leaned towards Su Mei and asked in a low voice: “Say, does cousin-in-law really have a way to cross over?”</p>
 <p>“Of course!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei raised her chin proudly.</p>
 <p>“My miss can do anything. In this world, there’s nothing that’s difficult for my miss!”</p>
 <p>“Continue to brag! Even a feather of a chicken was blown to the sky by you! Not even afraid that if the leather broke, it’ll be embarrassing!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Lian couldn’t understand why protective Su Mei is towards Murong Qi Qi and she whispered those words.</p>
 <p>“What did you say?!”</p>
