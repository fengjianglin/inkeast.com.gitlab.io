 <p><em>This chapter was&nbsp;edited by ororomunroe90</em></p>
 <p>Chapter 38 Jue Se Fang</p>
 <p>“This thing that happened today, you aren’t allowed to spread, understand?”</p>
 <p>Even though&nbsp;Longze Jing Tian’s back was facing the imperial physician, the old imperial physician could still feel Jing <em>wang’s</em>[1. Wangye/ wang: prince of the first rank] repressed anger. He quickly said two times “don’t dare” before he retreated.</p>
 <p>“Servants!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian snapped. Two people in black appeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Go get Murong Xin Lian for <em>benwang</em>[2. Benwang: I, used by a wangye]!"</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Xin Lian was anxiously waiting for the result. The medicine should take effect soon! It's only common sense that Longze Jing Tian’s guards would come to get her, the only woman in the&nbsp;<em>wangfu</em>[3. Wangfu: residence of a wangye]. But why was she kept waiting for so long, there still hasn't been any movement?!</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian was in deep thoughts that she didn’t even notice the two people who had appeared at her back. A muffled sound could be heard, Murong Xin Lian became limp in one of the people in black's embrace.</p>
 <p>Lu Ye was now so hot that he had become irrational. Longze Jing Tian and Lu Yuan put Lu Ye on the bed. After seeing Murong Xin Lian in the bed, Lu Yuan was shocked: “<em>Wangye, </em>this… ….”</p>
 <p>“All of this is done by this bitch! Let her do it!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian stopped Lu Yuan and pulled down the curtains. No matter how much Murong Xin Lian screamed from pain inside the curtains, Longze Jing Tian remained unmoved. And Lu Yuan, after knowing what Murong Xin Lian had done, his impression of her directly hit the bottom and now thought&nbsp;she was shameful.</p>
 <p>After one night, Murong Xin Lian had been&nbsp;tormented half to death. After that, she was thrown back to her place by Longze Jing Tian’s guards. When Murong Xin Lian woke up, the pain, along with those green and purple places on her body, made her jump for joy.</p>
 <p>Was it Longze Jing Tian who came over? Was the man from last night him? Then, will she get pregnant? Murong Xin Lian stroked her belly. Although her body's in pain, but in her heart, she's happy. At least, she got what she wanted.</p>
 <p>After hearing people report Murong Xin Lian’s condition, Longze Jing Tian revealed a mocking smile.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>won’t you give her soup for not having children… …”</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan was worried. It would be bad if Murong Xin Lian becomes pregnant. It wouldn't be good for w<em>angye’s </em>reputation.</p>
 <p>“No need.”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian shook his finger.</p>
 <p>“Since this is her wish, why not fulfill it? What <em>bennwang </em>wants&nbsp;to see most is the expression of those greedy people when their dream is shattered! Let people serve c<em>e wangfei</em>[4. Cefei/ cewangfei: second ranked wife of a wangye] well. No matter if it’s things to use or to eat, give her the best. <em>Benwang </em>wants her to fall until&nbsp;all bones are&nbsp;broken!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the cruel smile on Longze Jing Tian's face, Lu Yuan knew that this <em>wangye</em>&nbsp;was really being ruthless.</p>
 <p>But this was what she asked for herself. His own little brother Lu Ye was still unconscious in bed. The imperial physician said that the medicine was too strong, Lu Ye had hurt his body. He needed to rest well. All of this was thanks to Murong Xin Lian!</p>
 <p>In one month, Murong Xin Lian got the best of care. The whole <em>wangfu</em>&nbsp;was treating her as the female master, letting Murong Xin Lian’s pride become greatly satisfied.</p>
 <p>Aside from Longze Jing Tian not allowing her to go into the study and also never coming over to her place, the other things made Murong Xin Lian very content.</p>
 <p>As for Longze Jing Tian, Murong Xin Lian admits that she used tricks and made him angry, but Murong Xin Lian was sure that he had feelings for her. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have let people treat her like this.</p>
 <p>Besides, Murong Xin Lian already has a card in her hand. Her period hadn’t come this month. Let the heavens bless her with a child. Maybe she can then use this child. By then, she would be a step closer to the position of <em>wangfei</em>[5. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye]</p>
 <p>Finally, September arrived. Bei Zhou’s Nan Lin <em>wang </em>Feng Cang arrived at the capital after a month and a half trip.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wang, </em>all has been arranged. On the ninth of September, Longze Yu will hold a banquet. At that time, you can see <em>wangfei.</em>”</p>
 <p>Ru Yi helped Feng Cang put on clothes and then helped him comb his hair.</p>
 <p>After they finished dressing, Feng Cang drank medicine. The first thing he asked about was the banquet at the palace.</p>
 <p>“Is the dress for <em>wangfei </em>ready?”</p>
 <p>For almost two months, Feng Cang restrained the impulse to go see Murong Qi Qi. He had been quietly recuperating at the house located outside the capital. The so-called trip to Xi Qi was just a pretext. No one knew that he had long arrived at Xi Qi.</p>
 <p>“All is ready!”</p>
 <p>Ji Xiang clapped. Immediately, ten female servants appeared. In everyone’s hands, there’s a dress for Feng Cang to choose. With just a&nbsp;glance, Feng Cang frowned.</p>
 <p>“Dismissed!”</p>
 <p>Just with one look, Ji Xiang knew that her master isn't satisfied. She immediately let them retreat with the clothes.</p>
 <p>“Are those the dresses you chose?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s voice was very gentle, but it made Ji Xiang shudder. She immediately knelt down: “<em>Wangye, </em>don’t be angry. This slave admits the mistake!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang put a candied fruit in his mouth and sipped carefully. He didn’t let Ji Xiang get up. His finger gently tapped on the table.</p>
 <p>“I heard that in Xi Liang,&nbsp;a ‘Jue Se Fang’ has opened. Let’s go take a look. Perhaps there will be a surprise… …”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Ru Yi stood to one side. He didn’t dare to plead for his twin sister. He could only helplessly look at Ji Xiang once and escorted Feng Cang away.</p>
 <p>Jue Se Fang, one of Guang Hua <em>gongzi’s</em>[6. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer a famous unmarried man] shop. It originally opened at Nan Feng country. Now, it has opened a branch in Xi Liang, Xi Qi’s capital. Just a banner would've attracted a lot of people to watch. It wasn't even open yet, but has already caused a sensation.</p>
 <p>Everyone knows that Guang Hua <em>gongzi</em>’s Tong Bao Zhai is dedicated to creating jewelries and Jue Se Fang’s clothes were famous in the world.</p>
 <p>It’s rumored that Nan Feng country’s imperial noble consort He Lan Min loves Jue Se Fang’s dresses. After Jue Se Fang arrived, He Lan Min no longer wore anything embroidered in the palace. She only wore something from Jue Se Fang. And because of this imperial noble consort’s respect, it made Jue Se Fang’s fame reach an unparalleled height.</p>
 <p>“Young master, our shop will open at the ninth of September!”</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang, Fang Tong, had eyes in the shape of green beans. He looked smart with a little cunning and deceitfulness.</p>
 <p>Looking at Feng Cang who's dressed in white with a gauze hat, Fang Tong warmly served tea.</p>
 <p>“First, take a look. If there’s something pleasing to the eye, you can place an order.”</p>
 <p>“Good.”</p>
 <p>The moment Feng Cang opened his mouth, Fang Tong was surprised. Then he immediately smiled: “Take your time in looking. If you have the need, call the customer service personnel. They will answer&nbsp;you with the most detailed answer.”</p>
 <p>“Customer service personnel?”</p>
 <p>These words were very fresh… …</p>
 <p>Feng Cang looked at the store. Have to say Jue Se Fang is a unique shop. No need to say about those beautiful gorgeous clothes, but those life-size models made from wood carving made people admire Guang Hua <em>gongzi’s </em>mind.</p>
 <p>Clothes just hanging there are dead. When dressed on a model, they became alive. And there’s also those customer service personnel, who were full of smiles. They're dressed very finely. Even if they were dressed the same, but the nuances on the collar and cuffs was enough to help people realize their differences.</p>
 <p>Fang Tong hurried to the back and opened a door. After he went in, he shut the door. Seeing&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi inside, Fang Tong respectably knelt on one knee.</p>
 <p>“Rise!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi leisurely watched the scenery outside the window. Su Yue and Su Mei were standing at the other side.</p>
 <p>“Miss, a precious guest arrived downstairs. It seems he is the future <em>guye</em>[7. Guye: son in law/ also used by the servants of the female's family].”</p>
 <p>Fang Tong cautiously glanced at Murong Qi Qi. Nicknamed ‘preternaturally good hearing’, Fang Tong’s ears were the best in Moyu. He only needed to hear a voice one time; he would never forget it again. A few years in the past, Fang Tong went to&nbsp;Bei Zhou and saw Feng Cang. So that’s why the moment Feng Cang opened his mouth, just a ‘good’ and Feng Tong already knew his identity.</p>
