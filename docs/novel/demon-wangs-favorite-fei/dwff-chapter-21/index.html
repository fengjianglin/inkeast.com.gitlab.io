 <p>Chapter 21:&nbsp;Blood Colored Breaking Engagement Letter</p>
 <p>‘Si……’</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian tore his hem, spread it out on the stone table, bit his forefinger and wrote with the blood from his fingertip ‘Break off engagement letter’.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, today, I will dump you! If emperor father search for the blame, <em>benwang</em>[1. Benwang: this king, I used by the prince of first rank] will have an explanation!”</p>
 <p>‘Pa……’</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi stretched out her hand to catch the ‘break off engagement’ letter Longze Jing Tian threw at her. She swept her eyes once over it and once satisfied, passed it along to Su Yue so she could guard it well.</p>
 <p>Leaving Lian <em>gongzi’s</em>[2. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer to a famous unmarried man] embrace, Murong Qi Qi bowed at Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>“Thanking <em>wangye </em>[3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] for your help! Hoping that <em>wangye </em>will find the woman you like very soon and fly together!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words made Longze Jing Tian frown. Could it be that she knew the matter of Du Xian Er? On second thought, that was entirely impossible.</p>
 <p>“Humph! Murong Qi Qi, you better make the best out of it!”</p>
 <p>Finally, he found a reasonably excuse to dump this rubbish. This made Longze Jing Tian’s mood become very good. Suddenly, he felt his whole body relax. Not having a marriage anymore, he could now openly go search for Du Xian Er! Just thinking of the fairy in the forest made Longze Jing Tian feel happy.</p>
 <p>It was just that when he turned and looked at Murong Qi Qi’s bright smile under the sunlight, Longze Jing Tian had a feeling of defeat. She actually wantes to leave him so much and wanted to take off the identity of Jing <em>wangfei</em>[3. Wangfei: the main wife/consort of the prince of first rank] that everyone else wanted?</p>
 <p>Not being wanted by a rubbish, more or less damaged Longze Jing Tian’s proud self-esteem.</p>
 <p>“Acting on <em>wangye’s w</em>ords, I’ll surely live till hundred and scourge the millennium!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words thoroughly annoyed Longze Jing Tian. He immediately flipped his sleeves, turned and left. The others were lost behind him.</p>
 <p>“You really deserved it…….”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Hong Chen looked once at Murong Qi Qi, taking joy out of her calamity. Then he followed behind Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>“Little cousin sister, why?”</p>
 <p>After Longze Jing Tian left, Li Yun Qing sighed. He was not Longze Jing Tian, so of course he wouldn’t believe those nonsense words of Murong Qi Qi. It was just that he didn’t think that she wanted to free herself. Could it be that it was really like the song she sang that night?</p>
 <p>However, deep in his heart, Li Yun Qing was happy because Murong Qi Qi got her freedom back. Did this mean that he has a chance?</p>
 <p>“Big cousin brother, can this Long Hu Ling really ask you to do anything?”</p>
 <p>Being seen through by Li Yun Qing, Murong Qi Qi wasn’t a bit surprised. Such an intelligent man, how could he not see through her little play?!</p>
 <p>Seeing the Long Hu Ling in Murong Qi Qi’s hand, Li Yun Qing became serious.</p>
 <p>“Of course, this is my Li family’s keepsake. As long as you’re holding the Long Hu Ling, you can ask the people from Li family to do anything.”</p>
 <p>“That’s good!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s thick eyelashes shook violently. The dagger in her hands cut open Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>cloth in a lightning speed.</p>
 <p>Even as he felt the danger and dodged at his fastest, but the pain in his abdomen and the wet clothes told Lian <em>gongzi</em> that Murong Qi Qi had wounded him.</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, you want to murder your husband?”</p>
 <p>Lian <em>gongzi </em>smiled in pain and quickly touched his acupuncture point to stop the blood. He then wiped medicine on the wound and used his ripped clothes to bandage it. He had forgotten <em>wang’s </em>words when he was leaving: Docile on the outside, but in reality, you cannot mess with her.</p>
 <p>“When did evil doctor Jin Mo get a hobby of being an imposter?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li>Evil here doesn’t literally mean evil. It means he is a doctor of the dark side of the jianghu.</li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi went to one side. In her hand was the dagger Shangguan Wu Ji had gifted her.</p>
 <p>“Ruining my reputation, do you think you can still leave here smoothly?”</p>
 <p>‘Dang……’</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi took out the Long Hu Ling and threw it to Li Yun Qing.</p>
 <p>“Kill him!”</p>
 <p>It was the second time that Li Yun Qing saw Murong Qi Qi’s speed. The first time was when she had kicked Duanmu Yi Yi in the lake. The second time was just now. In front of that lightning speed, even Li Yun Qing would be humble. Was she really a physically weak woman?</p>
 <p>Not thinking anymore, Li Yun Qing took action against Lian <em>gongzi.</em></p>
 <p>Jin Mo, who had been confused by Murong Qi Qi’s smile, at this moment understood. He had fallen into Murong Qi Qi’s trap. She must have long seen through his identity and had the gall to use him to act in her play. And now, she even wanted him killed!</p>
 <p>Sure enough, women and villains were difficult to raise. A little woman like Murong Qi Qi must surely not offend.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Wu Ji at one side, after hearing the dialogue between them, finally understood that this man in blue clothes wasn’t actually Lian <em>gongzi. </em>Just thinking about how his nonsense words ruined Murong Qi Qi’s reputation, Shangguan Wu Ji got angry. He clenched his fists, roared once and rushed towards Jin Mo’s back.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, no matter what, I still helped you. How can you take revenge on the one who helped you?”</p>
 <p>Being attacked at the front and the back, even if Jin Mo was a level seven expert, he couldn’t escape from Shangguan Wu Ji and Li Yun Qing’s well-coordinated collaboration.</p>
 <p>“First sin, being an imposter; second sin, ruining my reputation; third sin, having ulterior motives. Jin Mo, you didn’t stay in Bei Zhou, why did you come to Xi Qi? Using the guise of Lian <em>gongzi </em>to get close to the empress. Say, should we tie you up and bring you to the office of justice to let them investigate you carefully? Or is it that you came here this time because of some secret mission?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi was standing in the shade. Her clear voice reached Jin Mo’s ears, making him stumble for a moment and almost fall from the sky. Very good! It’s really very good! Not only did she point out his identity, now she was also make him <em>wear such a big hat</em>.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Wearing a big hat: putting a big accusation on someone. MQQ is accusing him of doing a secret mission in Xi Qi</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Who didn’t know that strange doctor Jin Mo is Bei Zhou’s Nan Lin <em>wang</em> Feng Cang’s subordinate. Him appearing in Xi Qi and also coming in contact with Xi Qi country’s empress, everyone would think that there was some secrets here, some conspiracy.</p>
 <p>This woman was really good at playing politics. It was entirely killing without seeing blood……</p>
 <p>Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji also understood Murong Qi Qi's words. Especially when thinking about that Nan Lin <em>wang </em>Feng Cang of Bei Zhou who had the name of ‘demon <em>wang</em>’, the two’s heart trembled. Their attacks became more vicious.</p>
 <p>Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji deserved the title of the younger talents of Xi Qi country. Li Yun Qing was good at attacking. His weapon was a green jade flute plus he was wearing light colored clothes. Looking at him, he looked more like an immortal.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Wu Ji came from a family of generals. With just one attack, you’ll be able to see solid basic skills. His pair of tiger iron fists, Murong Qi Qi could totally imagine what the outcome would be if they landed on Jin Mo’s face which was refined as a precious jade.</p>
 <p>Jin Mo felt his figure had never been so sorry before. First, he was attacked by Murong Qi Qi. His belly had a not deep nor shallow wound that kept bleeding and now he is being attacked by two level seven experts, making his situation even more difficult.</p>
 <p>Moreover, that damned Murong Qi Qi seemed to have put a drug on the dagger. Jin Mo felt the wound becoming numb. His body is also becoming unconscious. His hand movements gradually slowed.</p>
 <p>‘Pa’.</p>
 <p>Jin Mo’s back has eaten Shangguan Wu Ji’s fists.</p>
 <p>Damned woman! In order to stop this drug from making him lose consciousness, Jin Mo tore the already bandaged wound. Blood flew out again. The pain shocked him, making him more awake. Jin Mo had some regrets. He should’ve listened to Feng Cang and shouldn’t have underestimated this woman! A woman who entered Feng Cang’s eyes, how could she be an ordinary woman……</p>
 <p>The three fighting in Duanmu residence had alerted Duanmu Lei and Duanmu Qing. When she learned that the man who had come today wasn’t strange doctor Lian <em>gongzi</em> but Bei Zhou’s evil doctor Jin Mo, Duanmu Qing paled.</p>
 <p>Just now, Jin Mo had checked her pulse. The secret of the mother of a country being unable to get pregnant was now known by a person of another country, this was really shameful! Immediately, unprecedented disgrace entered Duanmu Qing’s heart. This man couldn't be left alive, he must die!</p>
 <p>“Come people, kill this thief of Bei Zhou for <em>bengong</em>[4. Bengong: this palace, I used by the females of the imperial family]!”</p>
