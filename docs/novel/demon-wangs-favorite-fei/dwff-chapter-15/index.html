 <p>Chapter 15: Beating Someone at Their Own Game</p>
 <p>“I, I didn’t do anything……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi seemed to have been frightened by Murong Qing Lian’s words. Her eyes filled with a layer of water.</p>
 <p>“She rushed over herself, I don’t know why it become like this……”</p>
 <p>What happened just now, everyone understood clearly. When Duanmu Yi Yi’s sword whooshed over, Murong Qi Qi actually didn’t do anything, but why did it become Duanmu Yi Yi’s wrist being cut by a dagger? Have to say that this was to succeed by mistake. It could only be said that this Murong Qi Qi is really lucky!</p>
 <p>It’s just, was that really only luck? In Li Yun Qing’s eyes rose a touch of interest. It seems that this little cousin sister was like a huge treasure. The closer you get, the more surprised you’ll be.</p>
 <p>“Third miss, what happened just now, we saw it clearly. It has nothing to do with you. It was just an accident!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi scared like that, Shangguan Wu Ji quickly opened his mouth to appease her.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, even if they investigate it, I’ll testify for you!”</p>
 <p>“Young master Shangguan, thank you!”</p>
 <p>“Third little sister, drink a cup of wine to calm your nerves!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian poured wine and handed it over to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“We were looking; it was not your fault. You don’t need to worry too much. Daddy is also a reasonable person!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, second big sister!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi took over the glass of wine and brought it to her mouth. The moment it went into her mouth, she discovered the problem.</p>
 <p>Ah, she (MXL) actually put drug inside! She (MQQ) knew that today won’t end so easily. She (MQQ) waited for so long, Murong Xin Lian finally couldn’t wait anymore and took action. Murong Qi Qi’s thick lashed flashed slightly and calmly drank the wine.</p>
 <p>She has been thrown in the poison spring by godfather to soak for two years. She was simply immune to it such child's play. But since Murong Xin Lian was determined to trap her, why not beat her at her own game?!</p>
 <p>Not long after, Murong Qi Qi pressed her head with an appearance of having headache.</p>
 <p>“I feel a bit unwell. You continue to play. I’ll go back.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like this, Murong Xin Lian knows that the drug has taken action. She restrained the delight in her heart and put on a worried look.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t your maid come with you? I’ll let someone escort you! Ma Nao, bring third miss back to Cui Zhu <em>yuan</em>[1. Yuan: part of a residence]!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>A pretty girl immediately appeared in front of Murong Qi Qi and supported her.</p>
 <p>“Third miss, let’s go!”</p>
 <p>“Wait!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi retracted her hand. Murong Xin Lian paled. Could it be that she discovered something?</p>
 <p>“I have some things I didn’t take!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi walked to the table and put everyone’s bet in her embrace. Then she picked up ‘Xue Fu pill’ and handed it to Shangguan Wu Ji.</p>
 <p>“I’ve never met young master, but young master protected me. Take this Xue Fu pill as my thanks. Asking young master Shangguan to please take it!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Shangguan Wu Ji to reject, Murong Qi Qi stuffed the Xue Fu pill in his hands. Then she bowed gracefully at Bai Mu Fei and Bai Yi Yue.</p>
 <p>“Your kindness, Qi Qi will pay this gratitude in the future!”</p>
 <p>Once these are done, Murong Qi Qi once again pressed her temples and made an expression of pain.</p>
 <p>“Ma Nao, bring me back!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi left with Ma Nao, Murong Xin Lian let out a sigh of relief. Her expression also softened.</p>
 <p>Just now, Murong Jun had eaten something bad. He already went back. The things were going according to her expectations. In a moment, the drug on Murong Jun will take action. As long as Ma Nao led Murong Qi Qi to Murong Jun, firewood would encounter fire and would immediately burn.</p>
 <p>At this side Ma Nao was supporting the dizzy Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Third miss, third miss!”</p>
 <p>Calling twice and didn’t see Murong Qi Qi respond, Ma Nao went according to the plan. She supported Murong Qi Qi to a room and left in a hurry.</p>
 <p>After Ma Nao left, Murong Qi Qi opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Miss!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei appeared.</p>
 <p>“Did you found out?”</p>
 <p>She swept away her demeanor of just now. Murong Qi Qi’s eyes gleamed in the dark.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Su Mei whispered some words in Murong Qi Qi’s ears. Murong Qi Qi’s smile became wider and wider. Sure enough, dogs who bite people don’t bark. Murong Xin Lian was such a person. She wanted to destroy her reputation. She could even do such a wicked thing!</p>
 <p>“This subordinate already brought concubine Zheng here. Miss, do you want to move and left the bed for her?”</p>
 <p>Su Yue appeared at the door. Sure enough on her back she is carrying a woman.</p>
 <p>After Su Mei and Su Yue put down Zheng Min, the three left. Not long after they have left, Ma Nao walked in the room while supporting another person.</p>
 <p>“It’s really hot! Really hot!”</p>
 <p>Murong Jun torn his clothes and climbed in the bed. Then he touched a soft body.</p>
 <p>“Young master, this is second miss’s gift for you. Enjoy it!”</p>
 <p>Ma Nao dropped the curtain for the two, sneered and left.</p>
 <p>“Excitement will soon be played!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi smiled. If she hadn’t guessed wrong, not long after, Murong Xin Lian will bring people to catch ‘a couple in act’. If this matter was spread out, not only would she not be able to live, she was afraid that even Murong Jun will be destroyed by this.</p>
 <p>At the pavilion, after Murong Xin Lin saw Ma Nao did her heart finally calmed down. The smile on her mouth became wider and wider.</p>
 <p>“Second big sister, is there something that needs to be happy about, that you are so happy?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian felt Murong Xin Lian’s strangeness and asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian quickly denied while shaking her head. She quickly covered her guilty conscience. Murong Xin Lian stood up and poured wine for the others.</p>
 <p>“Today I invited you here. I didn’t know that so many things will happen and ruined everyone’s mood. I’m really sorry. I apologize to everyone with this cup of wine!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Xin Lian to drink the wine, rapid footsteps could be heard together with Murong Tai’s angry growl: “Where’s that unfillial daughter? Murong Qi Qi, roll out here!”</p>
 <p>It turned out that in just a moment, Duanmu family reported the matter of Murong Qi Qi hurting Duanmu Yi Yi to Murong Tai. The moment he heard that the rubbish of his family had hurt the empress’s niece and the fact that Duanmu Yi Yi’s wrist had been broken and it’ll be difficult to put it back together, Murong Tai’s anger was as high as the sky.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>The moment Murong Xin Lian saw that Murong Tai has come, her heart became happy.</p>
 <p>Really great! With Murong Tai here, Murong Qi Qi would definitely die today! The Murong Tai who always cared about face, if he saw Murong Qi Qi in act together with her biological big brother, didn’t know if he would or would not kill her on spot!</p>
 <p>Seeing that people of the three great families are still here, Murong Tai’s expression turned for the better, but his heart was still very angry.</p>
 <p>“Where is Murong Qi Qi?”</p>
 <p>“Third big sister is feeling unwell, she already went back.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian immediately reported in a well behaved posture the whereabouts of Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Humph! She is feeling unwell? Causing trouble and then pretending to be sick. She still has reasons!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Tai wanted to leave. She knew that he is going to make trouble for Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qing Lian rushed to his side.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I’ll go with you!”</p>
 <p>Watching a play, especially watching that rubbish being scolded, to Murong Qing Lian that was her happiest enjoyment.</p>
