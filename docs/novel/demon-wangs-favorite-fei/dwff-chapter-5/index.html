 <p>Chapter 5: Second Miss is Good at Acting</p>
 <p>The Murong Xin Lian who’d originally wanted to stop, touched her face. Warm. Bleeding. Murong Xin Lian’s anger reached another level! Murong Qing Lian’s wounds would stop swelling with some cream but the wounds on her own face were the real deal. If it left a scar, she was afraid that her looks would really be ruined!</p>
 <p>After thinking that Murong Qin Lian didn’t even care about sisterhood and destroyed her looks that she cared the most about, Murong Xin Lian was also no longer merciful.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian began to be serious. Murong Qing Lian was also not easy to deal with. She humphed coldly and also came up with her real skills. Since Murong Xin Lian ruined her face, she would also destroy Murong Xin Lian’s face!</p>
 <p>“Ping ping pang pang!”</p>
 <p>The two saw Murong Qi Qi’s Cui Zhu <em>yuan </em>[1. Yuan: a part of a residence] as a battlefield. Wherever they went, they would smash down.</p>
 <p>“Don’t, ah! My Cui Zhu <em>yuan, </em>ah! Don’t fight anymore!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s wailing continuously transmitted into Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian’s ears. It was ear-piercing and also let them pay more devotion and wrecked more things.</p>
 <p>At the other side, Murong Qi Qi separated Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu with difficulty.</p>
 <p>“You two, go persuade them quickly. Let them not fight anymore!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s expression looked really pitiful. Her demeanor was also out of place. While looking at Murong Qi Qi, Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu couldn’t help but humph coldly. In their hearts, they thought that third miss was really a good-for-nothing.</p>
 <p>“Third miss, the matter of the masters, we, slaves, cannot interfere.”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui fiercely glared once at Zhen Zhu and then straightened her clothes and hair.</p>
 <p>“You better watch at the side! Swords have no eyes. Be careful not to hurt yourself!”</p>
 <p>“But, But if they continue like this, I’m afraid that if daddy knew, he would be angry……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi lowered her head. Her hands were tugging at the handkerchief.</p>
 <p>“If he investigates the reason, then you two would also be punished.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi gentle words went into Fei Cui’s and Zhen Zhu’s ears and made them immediately understand.</p>
 <p>That’s right, today second miss and fourth miss caused such trouble, Murong Tai would not only rebuke one of the misses, he would only put the blame on them (FC and ZZ). At that time, the ones who would be suffering would be them.</p>
 <p>Thinking till there, Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu left Cui Zhu <em>yuan </em>one after another. They hurriedly went to search for savers. The two left in a hurry and didn’t notice the strange smile on Murong Qi Qi’s mouth.</p>
 <p>“Su Mei, Su Yue, guard.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s sentences were short. Su Mei and Su Yue understood that she was going to give some people a hard time. They immediately looked at the door. Fortunately, Cui Zhu <em>yuan </em>was originally a remote place and there were only them two who were serving. After Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu left, there were only five people here.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian had their hands full of fighting each other, when will they still have the time to bother with Murong Qi Qi? They were even more unaware of the strange atmosphere around them.</p>
 <p>“Shh…….”</p>
 <p>A slim and sharp sound came out of Murong Qi Qi’s lips. The sound reached Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian’s ears. The two acted as though they had heard the same command. Their eyes gradually turned red. All the resentment and jealousy they had towards the other seemed like firewood that had encountered a fire. The more it burned, the more intense it became.</p>
 <p>“Go……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi smiled. She looked again and the two people’s eyes had resumed clear, but the attacks became more vicious. Every attack was to take the other’s life.</p>
 <p>Envy, jealousy and hate, the sources of all evil!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi sat in the rocking chair and leisurely watched the fighting Murong Xin Lian and Murong Qing Lian. If you had no resentment in your heart, this opportunity wouldn’t had been given to me. The debt you owe this body, today pay fully for it back!</p>
 <p>When Murong Tai rushed over, he hadn’t stepped into Cui Zhu <em>yuan </em>yet when he heard Murong Qi Qi’s pitiful voice: “Second big sister, fourth little sister, don’t fight anymore! We are all sisters, what can we not talk about?! Second big sister, don’t, ah……”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai rushed inside. He saw Murong Qi Qi clutching her chest and gasping on the ground and Murong Xin Lian glaring fiercely at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Rubbish, don’t need you to intervene! Today, I’m going to kill this bitch! If you keep meddling, I’ll kill you first!”</p>
 <p>“Rebel! Everyone is rebelling!”</p>
 <p>Seeing his two dishevelled and full of bloodstains daughters, Murong Tai almost couldn’t breath.</p>
 <p>He was originally in a meeting with the Li family’s eldest young master, Li Yun Qing. He didn’t expect Fei Cui and Zhen Zhu to rush in at the same time while yelling for help for their misses, making Murong Tai so angry that he almost passed out. Now that he had come to Cui Zhu <em>yuan</em>, saw the wrecked look of the <em>yuan</em> and then, after seeing his two daughters’ sorry figures, Murong Tai became really furious.</p>
 <p>“Stop!”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai’s left hand grabbed Murong Xin Lian’s whip. His right hand grabbed Murong Qin Lian’s sword. He roared and finally the two stopped fighting.</p>
 <p>“Dad!”</p>
 <p>When Murong Qing Lian saw Murong Tai, her eyes immediately turned warm and tears fell down.</p>
 <p>“Dad, look at my face! I’ve been disfigured by her! You must get justice for daughter, ah!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian complain, Murong Xin Lian almost vomited blood. She was about to defend herself when she saw Li Yun Qing standing at one side. There&nbsp; was an outsider. Murong Xin Lian immediately put on her normally gentle and virtuous appearance. Delicately and pitifully, she stood to the side. She didn’t defend herself. She just let her big tears fall down.</p>
 <p>A genius, ah! Seeing Murong Xin Lian’s ‘virtuous’ appearance, Murong Qi Qi couldn’t help but praise this woman’s acting. If she was in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, she could even get the Oscar.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t because she needed to act like the miserable third miss who had been kicked at the chest, Murong Qi Qi would’ve grabbed Murong Xin Lian’s hand and awarded her the ‘Best Performance Award’.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>Seeing his two daughters’ sorry figures which were also stained with blood, Murong Tai frowned. His voice was also extremely severe.</p>
 <p>He knew that these two daughters didn’t get along with each other. He just saw it as girls’ ‘competition’.&nbsp; It was no big deal. But today, he clearly felt strong murderous intent from the two. This shouldn’t have happened.</p>
 <p>“Dad, it’s second big sister who began! She is jealous of me because I reached level four!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian seemed like she didn’t feel Murong Tai’s unhappy heart. Instead, she continued to pull at his hand and acted like a spoiled child.</p>
 <p>“Dad, second big sister wounded me. You have to punish her and make her kneel at the shrine!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian clearly felt that Murong Tai was really angry, but she couldn’t be like Murong Qing Lian and throw a tantrum. Murong Qing Lian was a talent at learning martial arts. She was only 14 but had already reached level four. In this country which favored martial arts, she had something to be proud of. Besides, Murong Qing Lian’s mother Liu Yan Zhi gave birth to Murong household's only male Murong Jun. She had a brother to protect her. That’s why she could speak like this with Murong Tai.</p>
 <p>Thinking till there, Murong Xin Lian knelt in front of Murong Tai.</p>
 <p>“Dad, it’s daughter’s fault! Daughter originally wanted to play a joke with fourth little sister, but in the end the joke got bigger and bigger and has even alarmed daddy. It’s daughter who is wrong!”</p>
 <p>Murong family’s two daughters; one was spoiled, one was gentle. This was the effect that Murong Xin Lian wanted. The more domineering Murong Qing Lian was, the more it showed that she (MXL) was a well-behaved and pleasant person. Even the crowd could see it clearly.</p>
