 <p>Chapter 34 One laughter on azure water (1)</p>
 <p><span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi’</span>s words almost made Duanmu Yi Yi vomit blood. Who doesn’t know Nan Lin <em>wang’s</em>[1. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank] situation? Even if <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi </span>went into a pit of fire herself, she shouldn’t harm people like this.</p>
 <p>The four great families know that Feng Cang sent people to teach <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi</span>. Now everyone believes <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi’</span>s words even more. Immediately, Duanmu Yi Yi forgot the pain in her face. She hastened away from <span style="color: #008000;">Longze Yu Er</span> and sat far away from her.</p>
 <p>“Looks like miss Duanmu forfeited, then <span style="color: #800000;"><em>bengong</em><span><a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></span></span>can only recommend<span style="color: #008000;"> princess Ping Yang</span>. But what do we do?! You and I are princesses. If we married together who will be the first wife and who will be the concubine?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi pretended to have a headache. She thought for a long time and suddenly said: “Aiya, how can <span style="color: #800000;"><em>bengong </em></span>forget? On the letter the emperor write to Bei Zhou clearly has <span style="color: #800000;"><em>bengong’s</em> </span>name. Since it’s like this, <span style="color: #008000;">princess</span> can only feel a bit wronged and be the concubine!”</p>
 <p><span style="color: #008000;">Longze Yu Er</span> almost fainted from anger. She doesn’t want to marry Feng Cang! Is because of this that Duanmu Qing pushed Murong Qi Qi out as the ‘scapegoat’! Marrying Feng Cang and also be the concubine, even if they beat her to death, she won’t be willing!</p>
 <p>“<span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi,</span> what is your motive?”</p>
 <p>Now <span style="color: #008000;">Longze Yu Er</span> finally understood why Duanmu Yi Yi hate<span style="color: #800000;"> Murong Qi Qi</span> so much; because she is really hateful!</p>
 <p>“How is <span style="color: #008000;">princess’s</span> mood right now? Is your appetite better? If you still feel uncomfortable, then my maid is really guilty. Doesn’t <span style="color: #339966;">princess</span> want to beat my maid? Quickly go do it, otherwise her sin will become bigger!”</p>
 <p>“<span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi</span>, you have guts!”</p>
 <p>Knowing that <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi i</span>s threatening her because of Su Yue<span style="color: #339966;">, Longze Yu Er</span> gritted her teeth: “<em>Bengong</em> is feeling very good now, very very good!”</p>
 <p>“Being young is so good. Say feel good and you’ll immediately feel good! Su Yue, quickly say thanks to <span style="color: #339966;">princess</span>!”</p>
 <p>Su Yue suppressed her laughter and walked to Longze Yu Er. She bowed: “Su Yue thanks <span style="color: #339966;">princess</span>!”</p>
 <p>This pair of master and servant is obviously bullying her, but <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi’s</span> words are put there. <span style="color: #339966;">Longze Yu Er</span> really worries that if she took Su Yue, <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi</span> will use underhanded ways to deal with her. She can only gulp down this anger. The second round, <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi</span> won again.</p>
 <p>The women’s liveliness reached the men’s side. In their hearts a lot of people have a new assessment of <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi</span>.</p>
 <p>Ever since he heard that <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi</span> needs to marry to Bei Zhou, Shangguan Wu Ji is very worried about <span style="color: #800000;">Murong Qi Qi’</span>s situation. He wanted to go see her, but have been stopped at the door by the people of Bei Zhou. Now seeing the young girl’s smile, Shangguan Wu Ji is happy for her, but he also feels somewhat at loss.</p>
 <p>Such a fine woman needs to marry Feng Cang! This is what Shangguan Wu Ji can’t accept. Speaking of this, great family Shangguan and Bei Zhou’s Feng family have a blood feud.</p>
 <p>Fifteen years ago, Xi Qi country and Bei Zhou county were at war at the border of Yangdang Mountain. Although it ended with Bei Zhou’s defeat, but the truth is that 400000 Xi Qi’s soldiers were beheaded by Bei Zhou’s army. Countless people of Shangguan family died, including Shangguan Wu Ji’s grandfather and several uncles were killed in the battle.</p>
 <p>Since young, Shangguan Wu Ji’s dream is to become a great general to led Xi Qi’s army against Bei Zhou to avenge the heroes of Shangguan family who died at that battle. But this dream hasn’t had the time to realize yet and she is already leaving.</p>
 <p>Just in a few days, Murong Qi Qi became the victim of the political battle and needs to marry to the far away Bei Zhou, marry Feng Cang. How can Shangguan Wu Ji accept his? After all, after all, this is the first time his heart moved for a woman, ah…….</p>
 <p>Moreover, that year, the one who helped Xi Qi’s army out of trouble is Murong Tai. Precisely because Murong Tai’s reinforcement arrived on time, Feng Xie suffered defeat, princess Ming Yue committed suicide to follow her husband. It can be considered that Murong Tai is Feng Cang’s archenemy who killed his father and mother. Since it’s like this, how can Feng Cang treat Murong Qi Qi well?</p>
 <p>Shangguan Wu Ji’s expression is not good. Li Yun Qing expression isn’t also very good. He promised to protect Murong Qi Qi. Now he sees that she has become a chest piece of someone else, but he is unable to change the outcome, making him hate himself.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi still has a soft smile on, but in that soft smile there’s stubbornness. It’s this unyielding attitude makes Li Yun Qing feel more bitter. If, if he was one step earlier, will the outcome be different?</p>
 <p>For a time, the atmosphere on the boat became down. Murong Xin Lian seeing this immediately let the music play and let the dance girl perform to let the atmosphere go up. It’s just that the song happens to be ‘A Glance at the mundane world’, making the people who knows where this song came from feel more conflicted.</p>
 <p>“Hearing this song once again reminded me of that day.”</p>
 <p>Bai Mu Fei is the only one in this group whose mood is at peace.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that in the future we won’t be able to hear such a good song anymore.”</p>
 <p>Bai Mu Fei’s lamenting has caught Murong Xin Lian: “Third little sister, today’s scenery is excellent, why don’t you make a new song?! It as how young master Bai said, in the future when little sister marries too far away, the mountain is high and the road is long, we won’t be able to hear little sister's voice anymore……”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s attitude is very sincere. Her expression was also at place. She seemed to be very concerned about Murong Qi Qi’s situation after she married to Bei Zhou. After all it the matter of Nan Lin <em>wang </em>being cursed and caused the death of his eight wives is a truth. It’s still a question of if Murong Qi Qi will be able to survive the wedding night. Moreover, Feng family and Xi Qi country also has history……</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t because Murong Qi Qi is familiar with Murong Xin Lian’s nature, Murong Qi Qi felt that she is almost taken over by Murong Xin Lian’s acting.</p>
 <p>Because of Murong Xin Lian’s words, the atmosphere on the boat turned more down. Even Duanmu Yi Yi who was laughing at Murong Qi Qi just now gave birth to a trace of pity. After all, Murong Qi Qi’s life is more bitter than hers!</p>
 <p>The only ones who didn’t change are Longze Yu Er and Murong Qing Lian. The ironic smile on their lips revealed their thoughts. They couldn’t wait for Murong Qi Qi to be finished.</p>
 <p>“<em>Deference is no substitute for obedience</em>!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Deference is no substitute for obedience: accepting a request</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi stood up. Murong Xin Lian has long guessed such a scene. Murong Qi Qi will never refuse. Seeing Murong Qi Qi walking into her trap, Murong Xin Lian’s eyes flickered with happiness. She let people prepare the instruments.</p>
 <p>After the instruments has been brought up and there was no <em>liuqin</em> that Murong Xin Lian wants, Murong Xin Lian deliberately got angry: “What? No <em>liuqin? </em>Why didn’t you prepare <em>liuqin? </em>Princess Zhao Yang can only play the <em>liuqin</em>. She doesn’t know how to play other instruments. How do you guys work?!”</p>
 <p>[caption id="attachment_3070" align="aligncenter" width="212"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3070" src="https://rosyfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/liu-qin.jpg" alt="liu qin" width="212" height="238"> liuqin[/caption]</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s voice is very loud. After hearing her words, Longze Yu Er laughed: “Xin Lian <em>jiejie, </em>don’t blame them! How can there be a <em>liuqin </em>at imperial big brother’s boat? Only a cheap geisha will use <em>liuqin. </em>This is a w<em>angye’s </em>boat and not a commoner boat for geisha’s.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>She means that it’s not a pleasure boat</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>The two people collaborated like one. Murong Qi Qi finally understand what Murong Xin Lian wants.</p>
 <p><em>Liuqin </em>is a musical instrument which can’t be put on the table. In front of these imperial and noble families it’s a shameful thing. On the surface, they are talking about <em>liuqin, </em>but in truth they are belittling Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian has been watching Murong Qi Qi silently. The feelings that this girl gave him today is really too much. Longze Yu Er domineering and arrogant attitude is famous in the capital. She was actually able to be like a <em>fox who exploited a tiger’s might</em> and quelled princess Ping Yang. This little woman is so brave.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>fox who exploited a tiger’s might: intimidated someone powerful</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Now seeing Murong Xin Lian making things difficult for Murong Qi Qi, Longze Jing Tian is sitting still on the bench to watch. He wants to see how Murong Qi Qi will resolve this embarrassment.</p>
