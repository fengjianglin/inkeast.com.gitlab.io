 <p><em>This chapter was&nbsp;edited by ororomunroe90</em></p>
 <p>Chapter 46 He likes to tease</p>
 <p>Immediately, the atmosphere turned cold. Feng Cang coldly looked up at Longze Yu Er. His gaze was like an ice knife.</p>
 <p>“Who are you talking about? Say it once more?”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s words made the whole place&nbsp;freeze. The icy&nbsp;air emitting from his body made even Longze Yu sitting on the highest seat feel cold. No wonder, at Bei Zhou, there are some who say that they would rather offend the emperor than the demon <em>wang</em>[1. Wang/ wangye: prince of the first rank]… …</p>
 <p>“I, I… …,” Longze Yu Er stuttered. Don’t know why, but when she met Feng Cang’s pair of eyes full of killing intent, she, who'd always been eloquent, suddenly became someone who didn’t know what to do. Her two rows of teeth were&nbsp;clattering, not because of anger, but because of fear.</p>
 <p>The killing intent from that person was real. And this kind of killing intent was not ordinary, but it was the same experience as on the battle field. Just the hostility alone already made people’s heart feel very cold. To put it plainly, Longze Yu Er was just a princess who was raised in the palace. When had ever she seen a posture like this?</p>
 <p>“I, I… …”</p>
 <p>Just when&nbsp;the entire Hall of Supreme Harmony had almost become&nbsp;Feng Cang’s icehouse because of Longze Yu Er’s stupidity, Murong Qi Qi spoke softly: “<em>Wangye, </em>I’m hungry.”</p>
 <p>One ‘I’m hungry’ pressed down Feng Cang’s emotions. Feng Cang put away the coldness from his body. No matter how big of a thing it was, it couldn’t be compared to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, what do you want to eat? I’ll pick it up for you!”</p>
 <p>“Bamboo shoot!”</p>
 <p>[caption id="attachment_7191" align="aligncenter" width="282"]<img class="size-full wp-image-7191" src="http://volarenovels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bamboo-shoots.jpg" alt="bamboo shoots" width="282" height="179"> bamboo shoots[/caption]</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi pointed at the dish located&nbsp;to&nbsp;the left side of Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>“Good!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the whole atmosphere relaxed. Just a moment ago, it was <em>twenty-seven days after the Winter Solstice</em>. Now, it had returned back to spring. It was a surprise to everyone that Murong Qi Qi had been able to calm down Feng Cang’s emotions. No need to even mention the people of high status. The way they looked at Murong Qi Qi became even more different.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Twenty-seven days after the Winter Solstice: the coldest day of the year</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Seeing that all of Feng Cang’s attention was focused entirely on Murong Qi Qi, Ming Yue Xin quickly stood up.</p>
 <p>“Emperor uncle, this Xin <em>er</em>[2. Er: term of endearment] especially prepared the dance ‘Tread wave’ for you!”</p>
 <p>“Good, good, good!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu was happy that someone had come forward to warm up the scene. Just now, Longze Yu Er acted&nbsp;really too muddle-headed. She actually dared to say that about Feng Cang. Longze Yu broke into a cold sweat because of this reckless daughter. He was afraid that Feng Cang would let her blood splatter the hall. At this moment, Ming Yue Xin's willingness to perform, naturally Longze Yu would support it.</p>
 <p>With the play of the music, Ming Yue Xin began to dance. Have to say that her waist was very flexible. Her expression was also in place, expressing a cute girl vividly and also attracting everyone’s attention.</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian picked up the bottle of wine and looked at the dance. His gaze fell upon&nbsp;that pair of lovers.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s greatness was not part of Longze Jing Tian's expectations. It really matched the old saying ‘seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times’. No matter what the rumors were, it’s not as accurate as seeing it in person. Although Longze Jing Tian is an outstanding person among the imperial children, but now compared to Feng Cang, he couldn’t help but admit that he would lose on one point.</p>
 <p>As for Murong Qi Qi, he's even more surprised. Longze Jing Tian’s mind couldn’t help but think back to the forest when he saw Du Xian Er. Obviously, Murong Qi Qi’s looks are ordinary and he had seen her several times, but in his mind, he still couldn’t help but compare the two. Even Longze Jing Tian himself felt that it’s strange.</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s attitude made Murong Xin Lian sitting next to him mistakenly think that he took a fancy at Ming Yue Xin. Looking at the girl vividly dancing, Murong Xue Lian’s palms were full of cold sweats.</p>
 <p>What should she do? What should she do?! If Ming Yue Xin announced that she wants a marriage alliance with Longze Jing Tian, then what should she do? Being stepped on by an official wife who is a princess, even if she gives birth to a son, it will only be a son from the illegitimate line. He simply cannot become someone bigger!</p>
 <p>No! Can’t let Ming Yue Xin enter the household! Only she, Murong Xin Lian, can become Jing <em>wangfei&nbsp;</em>[3. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye] and only she has the right to become the future empress! Just in a moment, Murong Xin Lian made up her mind. She needs to compete with Ming Yue Xin to see who is better. She can’t let her position be occupied by another!</p>
 <p>On the other side, Ming Yue Cheng was still wearing a purple robe. On the table was his beloved wine gourd. The only difference today was that his hair's neatly combed with a crown above his head. It’s just on his forehead, there were a few strands of hair, which highlighted the owner’s original character.</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng poured wine for himself and drank on his own. He also wasn't sitting according to etiquette like the others. Instead, he had found a comfortable position and leaned in that position. His gaze steadily stared at Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>After not having seen her for a few days, the aura around this girl seemed to have become more powerful. Just now, she was the closest to Feng Cang when he showed hostility, but she not only wasn't afraid but actually dispersed the hostility with a few floating words. It seems that this girl’s ability is great! Or Feng Cang also knew that she is different… …</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Xin did her best to move her waist. From time to time, she would look at Feng Cang. But Feng Cang didn’t seem to have any interest in Ming Yue Xin. He just cared about his little <em>wangfei</em> now. He mustn’t let her go hungry. Finally, he got the interest, put down his status as w<em>angye</em> and began to serve Murong Qi Qi dishes.</p>
 <p>“Eat more, you are too skinny. Having a little more meat is a good feel… …”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang’s words made Murong Qi Qi almost bite her tongue. Good feel? Does he like the types with more meat?</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>no matter how much I eat, I won’t become fat.”</p>
 <p>“Oh… …”</p>
 <p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi’s words, Feng Cang looked at her thoughtfully for a long time before saying: “Qing Qing, I heard that after a woman gets married and is in a loving relationship with her husband, they will gain some weight. Why don’t we get married as soon as possible?!”</p>
 <p>“Ke ke……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi choked. This <em>wangye s</em>eemed to not rest if he hasn’t startled people. What loving relationship? His other wives didn’t even live past the wedding night! Could it be the earlier they marry, the earlier she'll meet her demise and go reincarnate?</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, the direction of your thoughts is wrong!”</p>
 <p>After realizing what Murong Qi Qi was thinking, Feng Cang pushed that devilish face forward. That pair of beautiful eyes locked onto Murong Qi Qi’s eyes. He earnestly said: “Qing Qing, I don’t eat people!”</p>
 <p>“Pu… …”</p>
 <p>Finally, Murong Qi Qi couldn’t hold it in anymore. All the food in her mouth sprayed onto Feng Cang’s face.</p>
 <p>“Eh… …”</p>
 <p>Seeing the scattered rice on Feng Cang’s face, Murong Qi Qi laughed embarrassingly. A pair of hands quickly pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his face casually.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>I didn’t do it on purpose. I just couldn’t hold it in anymore… ….”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Murong Qi Qi spray rice on Feng Cang’s face, Longze Yu Er laughed. She'd heard that Feng Cang had an obsession with cleanliness. Murong Qi Qi acting like this, wouldn’t he kill her?</p>
 <p>The eyes that were originally on Ming Yue Xin, were now staring at Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang. In a moment, the atmosphere turned even stranger than before. Many people were mourning for the unlucky Murong Qi Qi. Provoking demon w<em>ang, </em>hope she makes the best of it!</p>
 <p>Feng Cang didn’t seem to have noticed the strange atmosphere. Instead, he was enjoying Murong Qi Qi’s ‘serve’. Her hands are really soft and there’s also a faint fragrance on them. This fragrance is different from the women’s smell powder, but instead it has a natural sweetness, a kind of green apple flavor.</p>
 <p>That’s right, it’s apple! Thinking till here, Feng Cang moved his gaze to Murong Qi Qi’s not thin nor thick pair of red lips. Don’t know if the taste there also has the smell of apples! Sentimental with a slight sweetness…….</p>
