 <p>Chapter 80 Princess Bao Zhu’s good calculation (2)</p>
 <p>“A stroll?”</p>
 <p>After hearing Su Mei say that princess had come to invite her, Murong Qi Qi was surprised. She didn’t expect that the two would stay quiet for a few days and were now again not well-behaved. Today, Feng Cang went out of the city to inspect the venue for the tournament of the four countries. The moment he left, the two came over. Really clever.</p>
 <p>“Princess, it’s so cold. Don’t go out! They are a <em>weasel paying a New Year call to a chicken,&nbsp;</em>with no good intentions!”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <ul>
  <li><em>A weasel is an enemy of the chicken, often attacking and eating them when it is dark. If it pays a courtesy call to a chicken during New Year, it does this not out of kindness or politeness, but with an ulterior motive—to find an opportunity to catch the chicken and eat it up. So, never trust the apparent friendliness of a weasel. In this idiom, the weasel is a metaphor for someone with an evil intention, and the chicken is a metaphor for someone weak and vulnerable. This idiom is used to describe someone pretending to be kind and friendly, but with an evil intention at heart or having an axe to grind</em>.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Su Mei disliked Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die to the extreme. If it wasn’t for the big picture, she would’ve taken action long ago .</p>
 <p>“Su Mei, do you mean, miss, I, is a chicken?”</p>
 <p>“Eh……,” Su Mei suddenly remembered that Murong Qi Qi previously told them the meaning of ‘chicken’. She immediately waved her hands.</p>
 <p>“Miss, I only did a comparison. You are not a chicken. How could you be a chicken……?”</p>
 <p>“Su Mei, don’t talk anymore!”</p>
 <p>Su Yue at one&nbsp;side, laughed with a bent back. Su Mei realized that she said a lot of ‘chicken’ and quickly stopped.</p>
 <p>“In short, it’s absolutely not a good thing that they came. You should stay in the warm house and shouldn’t lower yourself to their level!”</p>
 <p>“Why shouldn’t I go? Could it be that I’m afraid of them?”</p>
 <p>People coming personally to search for abuse. How would it be alright if she didn’t abuse them a bit? She also didn’t have to worry about much.</p>
 <p>“Su Yue, bring my cloak. I’ll go meet them!”</p>
 <p>By the time Murong Qi Qi arrived at the entrance of Meixiang <em>yuan</em>[1. Yuan: wing of a residence]<em>,&nbsp;</em>Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die had almost frozen to death.</p>
 <p>When Wanyan Bao Zhu came to make trouble once; wanting to live at Meixiang <em>yuan,&nbsp;</em>she was driven out by Feng Cang. Feng Cang made a command. Aside from Wanyan Kang, anyone else who wanted to enter Meixiang <em>yuan,&nbsp;</em>must let the guards inform first. This command directly blocked Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die at the entrance.</p>
 <p>Of course, Murong Qi Qi knew about this. So, she dawdled in&nbsp;dressing up for a long time before coming out. Now seeing Wanyan Bao Zhu’s and Mu Yu Die’s somewhat black lips, her mood lightened up.</p>
 <p>“Yo, letting princess and miss Mu wait for a long time, really sorry!”</p>
 <p>Although her mouth was apologizing, but Murong Qi Qi’s face didn’t have a trace of guilt, making Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die so angry, they gritted their teeth. However, here was Meixiang <em>yuan</em>, is Feng Cang’s territory. The place was surrounded with Feng Cang’s guards, how would they dare to use their hands on Murong Qi Qi?</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing, it’s nothing! Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu put on a smile uglier than crying. In her heart, she was cursing Murong Qi Qi. Bitch, you wait and see! In a while, you’ll see!</p>
 <p>When they were about to enter the carriage, Mu Yu Die saw that behind Murong Qi Qi followed Su Mei, so she immediately said: “Princess is going out with us. We three will chat and walk through the streets a bit. We’ll be back shortly. She doesn’t have to follow! This carriage is small, I and princess Bao Zhu also didn’t bring maids!”</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Although she doesn’t know what kind of trick the other party was playing, but Murong Qi Qi still nodded and let Su Mei go back.</p>
 <p>Inside the carriage, Murong Qi Qi immediately smelled a special fragrance. Ah, soft fragrance powder? Even used such stuff? Really a bit too low!</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <ul>
  <li><p><br></p><p><br></p></li>
  <li><em>Soft fragrance powder is a drug usually in the form of a powder and sometimes in other forms like liquid or pills. This drug is able to make the whole body lose all energy. Even lifting a finger would be impossible.</em></li>
  <li><p><br></p><p><br></p></li>
 </ul>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Seeing Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die were pretending that&nbsp;everything was fine, Murong Qi Qi knew they had definitely taken the antidote. Since you want to play, I’ll play very well with you! Murong Qi Qi sat next to the incense burner. Her small hands touched the incense burner and then she retrieved her hands back.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi touch the incense burner, Wanyan Bao Zhu’s heart almost jumped out. Could it be that she'd guessed there’s something wrong with the incense? Only after Murong Qi Qi retrieved her hands back, did Wanyan Bao Zhu’s hanging heart calm down.</p>
 <p>That’s right, she is just a rubbish. How would she know what soft fragrance powder is? Besides, this was something Chou <em>er</em>[2. Er: term of endearment]&nbsp;had bought from a veteran. How would ordinary people know about it?!</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu laughed and felt that she was being oversensitive. Usually, Murong Qi Qi had Feng Cang at her side. Today, she was just a general without an army. She can’t do anything. Why should she (WBZ) be so cautious and afraid of her (MQQ)?</p>
 <p>“Princess seems very happy!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi spoke leisurely. One hand propped up her chin while her eyes swept over Wanyan Bao Zhu’s smiling face.</p>
 <p>“No, nothing!”</p>
 <p>Being seen through by Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Bao Zhu felt somewhat guilty like a thief. She immediately waved her hand and denied.</p>
 <p>“Just the thought of being&nbsp;able to see the venue a bit later, I feel very happy. In a few days, I’ll be competing there. I feel a bit excited!”</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that princess is happy to see <em>wangye</em>[3. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank]!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die joked at one side. Wanyan Bao Zhu’s face turned red. She looked at Murong Qi Qi and saw that the other party didn’t talk. She then smiled embarrassingly: “Yu Die, what are you saying?! A moment later, when we see Cang <em>gege</em>[4. Gege: big brother]<em>,&nbsp;</em>the person who should be happy is princess Zhao Yang!”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say to take a stroll on the streets in Yongzhou city? Why should we go outside the city to the venue?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi wasn’t a fool. These two changed their lines fast. In just a moment, it became outside the city. It appears that outside the city was the critical place. There must be something waiting for her (MQQ) there!</p>
 <p>“Originally, I wanted to take a stroll in the city, but suddenly I’m very curious about how the venue looks. You also know that I’m a contestant. By seeing the venue earlier, I can also prepare myself mentally. The chance of winning becomes a lot bigger then! By then, when I win, it’s also helping you and Cang <em>gege</em>, yo! If our Bei Zhou gets first place, then you are Nan Lin <em>wang’s wangfei</em>[5. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank], ah!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu had long prepared these lines. Now speaking them out very smoothly, it was also&nbsp;high sounding.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, that’s right! I also want to go see the venue. Although I can’t participate in the tournament, but looking is also good! Princess Zhao Yang, can you fulfill this little request of mine? After all, for me, not being able to participate in the tournament of the four countries is a very regrettable thing……”</p>
 <p>The two collaborating, Murong Qi Qi felt that it’s very interesting. Now, Mu Yu Die had&nbsp;a pained face with a pitiful expression and wanting to move Murong Qi Qi, made her (MQQ) almost laugh out loudly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, no problem! <em>Wangye&nbsp;</em>went out early in the morning. Speaking of it, I also quite miss him. You go look at the venue. I’ll go look for <em>wangye</em>! It so happens that I also want to give <em>wangye&nbsp;</em>a surprise. Don’t know what kind of expression <em>wangye&nbsp;</em>will have when he sees me! Really looking forward to it, ah!”</p>
 <p>How could these two be Murong Qi Qi’s opponents at acting? While talking, Murong Qi Qi intentionally revealed a happy expression, making the two women so angry, they clenched their fists.</p>
 <p>What a hateful woman! Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die exchanged glances. The determination to get rid of Murong Qi Qi was now even more pronounced.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi pretended to turn a blind eye towards their glance. Just now, she carefully smelled the soft fragrance powder. According to the formula, it must be from Wu Ji Gong. Just a jealousy between women, didn’t expect that it would also involve Wu Ji Gong. The way Murong Qi Qi looked at Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die became a lot more different.</p>
 <p>It’s just, don’t know how they got in contact with Wu Ji Gong. Or, there’s another person……But no matter what, today these two women began first. Then if she became ruthless later, she can’t be blamed for being merciless!</p>
 <p>The carriage went out of the city gate. Slowly, it drove onto the snow. Murong Qi Qi pushed aside the curtain and looked back once. This was the west gate. The venue was clearly at the east gate. It seemed that she had guessed correctly.</p>
 <p>In her heart, Murong Qi Qi knew very well, but she didn’t make a sound. Her small face was blushing. After each road, she’ll ask the driver when she could see <em>wangye.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi like that, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die revealed a sneer. Let you be proud for a little while longer. When we arrive at that place, then we’ll let you <em>cry out to the heavens, but the heavens don't respond. Cry out to the earth, but the earth is impervious</em>!</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <ul>
  <li><p><br></p><p><br></p></li>
  <li><em>Cry out to the heavens, but the heavens don't respond. Cry out to the earth, but the earth is impervious: to be without aid.&nbsp;</em></li>
  <li><p><br></p><p><br></p></li>
 </ul>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Further and further away, they travelled from the west gate. When&nbsp;they could no longer to see Yongzhou city, the sound of many hooves were suddenly heard.</p>
 <p>“Stop! Robbery!”</p>
 <p>When the driver saw such a scene, he immediately panicked. He stopped the carriage and knelt in front of the group of people.</p>
 <p>“Heroes, I, I’m just a driver. I don’t have anything. Please let me go!”</p>
 <p>“Get lost,” a man shouted. The driver ran and rolled in the direction from where he came. He didn’t expect that after he ran for four or five meters, the man would throw a sword at him and directly cut off the driver’s head. The head fell onto the ground and rolled a few times, leaving a trace of warm blood still emitting gas.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha!”</p>
 <p>The people around the man laughed exaggeratedly, as if seeing blood was a thing that made them very excited.</p>
 <p>“Killed someone!”</p>
 <p>Although this was her own arrangement, but seeing the head of the driver rolling on the ground was beyond her expectations, making Wanyan Bao Zhu surprised with a trace of being scared. Why wasn’t it the same like what Chou <em>er</em> said? Obviously, they were only planning on going against Murong Qi Qi. Why did they kill her driver?</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Wanyan Bao Zhu to understand the matter, the curtain was&nbsp;opened by a sword. A face with a scar made by a sword appeared in front of the three people.</p>
 <p>“Yo, it’s three chickens!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar wiped away the snow on the bottom of his mustache and grinned, revealing a white tooth.</p>
 <p>“Brothers, today we’ve a good harvest. We’ll get to eat meat!”</p>
 <p>“Oh! Oh!”</p>
 <p>The moment the men outside the carriage heard that there’s women, they all shouted excitedly.</p>
 <p>“What do we do?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die saw the hungry look of those men, she was dumbfounded and immediately looked at Wanyan Bao Zhu. Why was this not the same as what they had talked about before? Didn’t they contact the killers of Wu Ji Gong? How come it became a group of bandits?</p>
 <p>“Get off the carriage! Get off the carriage! Don’t dillydally!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar cut the carriage with the sword.</p>
 <p>“Still not getting off the carriage? Could it be that you want me to go invite you?!”</p>
 <p>“You, you guys get down first……,” Wanyan Bao Zhu’s voice began to tremble. Seeing her appearance like that, Murong Qi Qi chuckled loudly. She straightened her clothes and carefully went off the carriage.</p>
 <p>“Boss, it’s really a chick! It’s a good chick!”</p>
 <p>A short man saw Murong Qi Qi, he immediately shouted.</p>
 <p>“Boss, the way that chick gets down the carriage looks very nice! Could she be a lady?”</p>
 <p>“Look at your unpromising appearance!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar spat on the ground and glanced once at the small and exquisite Murong Qi Qi. Then he looked at Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>“Hurry up, hurry up. Why do you dawdle so much? Could it be that you are waiting for someone to come save you?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die get down the carriage very reluctantly. Her palms were full of sweat. She was very afraid. She really didn’t know why&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi could be so calm.</p>
 <p>“Boss, this chick is also alright. Only, she is a bit old and too cocky. I still like that miss of just now better!”</p>
 <p>The one who talked, was still that short man of just now. An ‘old’ made Mu Yu Die’s expression sank. Does she really look very old? Otherwise, why would that shorty say that? She obviously looks more beautiful than Murong Qi Qi, why do these men like Murong Qi Qi more?</p>
 <p>But this way also let Mu Yu Die feel&nbsp;relieved. The bandits taking a fancy to Murong Qi Qi, it’ll be best if they kidnapped her and made her the wife of bandits, so no one would&nbsp;fight with her over Feng Cang anymore!</p>
 <p>While Mu Yu Die was secretly being happy about the bandits taking a fancy to&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi, Wanyan Bao Zhu dawdled in the carriage for a long time before coming down. Finally, when the man with the scar wasn’t paying attention, Wanyan Bao Zhu cut down the rope binding the horse with a knife. She turned and got on the horse. Her legs clipped on the horse’s belly. While slapping the horse butt, with a ‘jia’ sound, the horse rushed out like wind.</p>
 <p>“Yo, want to run?”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar laughed. His eyes showed disdain for Wanyan Bao Zhu’s little trick. Then, he took out a long rope, and riding a horse, chased after her.</p>
 <p>This man was an excellent equestrian. Didn’t take long before he caught up with Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>“Rise!”</p>
 <p>The man swung the rope in his hands. The rope formed a big circle and wrapped around Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>“Go!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar suddenly pulled, dragging Wanyan Bao Zhu down. She fell onto the snow.</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous! Let me go! I’m princess Bao Zhu! Don’t you want to live anymore?! Let me go!”</p>
 <p>From birth till now, this was the first time Wanyan Bao Zhu was in such a sorry state. She’s actually being dragged in the snow. She is the noble princess. When has she received such treatment?!</p>
 <p>“Bastard! Let me go! I’m a princess! You this bastard! <em>Bengong</em>[6. Bengong: this palace/ I, used by females of the imperial family]<em>&nbsp;</em>will execute your nine generations! Bastard!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s voice was very loud. Although they were separated by some distance, but the wind still brought her voice over.</p>
 <p>“Boss, that chick is very shrew. Really suits you!”</p>
 <p>The shorty shouted at this side. Murong Qi Qi chuckled softly. She felt that this scene was very funny. Didn’t Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to play a trick on her, why did it become like this?</p>
 <p>The man with the scar didn’t care if Wanyan Bao Zhu was a princess or something else. He tied the rope and pulled her up from the snow without any tender or protective feelings for the fairer sex.</p>
 <p>“Princess, is everything alright?!”</p>
 <p>When the man with the scar was in front of them, Mu Yu Die rushed to Wanyan Bao Zhu’s side and helped her remove&nbsp;the rope.</p>
 <p>“Princess, princess!”</p>
 <p>“Gegege!”</p>
 <p>All the way, Wanyan Bao Zhu had been&nbsp;facing the ground and ate&nbsp;a lot of dirty snow. The skin on her face was also&nbsp;broken because of the rubbing. At this time, the usual face had disappeared. Where was there a trace of the number one beauty of Bei Zhou? She was like a just-pulled-out bright red radish!</p>
 <p>“Big brother, this chick is too ugly! Really an ugly thing,” the shorty once again shouted. I don’t like such an ugly shrew. It’s better to sell her to a low-grade brothel! Brothers, what do you think?!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right!”</p>
 <p>The bandits shouted and raised their swords.</p>
 <p>“We don’t want the ugly and old women! We only want the young miss to be our bandit’s wife!”</p>
 <p>“You, bastards! <em>Bengong&nbsp;</em>is a princess! You, this group of bastards! <em>Bengong w</em>ants to kill you!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to urge her inner energy to kill these people. She was a fourth level martial artist. Soon, she would enter level five. As long as she could push out her inner energy, she could easily kill these bastards! Wanyan Bao Zhu’s idea was good, but when she urged her inner energy, she found out that her whole body was soft. She didn’t have the slightest strength.</p>
 <p>“Princess, it’s useless!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die shook her head while smiling bitterly. Just now, when she went down the carriage, she wanted to use the same way to protect herself, she didn’t expect that she wouldn’t be able to use it.</p>
 <p>“Why is it like this?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was startled. Didn’t they take the antidote? Could it be that Chou <em>er&nbsp;</em>lied to her? Who is that woman? Damn it! She actually has been fooled! Why is it like this?!</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s face was like a plate full of pigments. Very colorful. There were more dark colors. From Wanyan Bao Zhu’s face, Mu Yu Die already guessed the reason. Her expression immediately changed. The men obviously looked like people not to be trifled with. Now, they didn’t even have the strength to truss a chicken, how would they escape?</p>
 <p>“Princess, why is it not the same as what you had told me?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die tried her best to calm down.</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong&nbsp;</em>also don’t know!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu gritted her teeth and glared once fiercely at Murong Qi Qi. It’s all because of that woman. That woman made her be impatient and be fooled! Everything was because of her!</p>
 <p>“Heroes, we are just weak women and don’t have any ties or hate with you. Asking you to please let us go!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die raised her head and looked at the man with the scar. This man was the leader of these bandits. As long as she could move him, they would be saved.</p>
 <p>“If you came because of money, we’ve some. Besides in Yongzhou, we also have money. I can go back to take money for you!”</p>
 <p>“Money?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Mu Yu Die mention money, the man with the scar pondered for a moment.</p>
 <p>“You guys go back to take some money? If you come back with officers and not money, then what? No, no, this won’t do!”</p>
 <p>“You can leave a hostage here, ah! With a hostage, you won’t be afraid that we’ll go back on our words!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die immediately seized the opportunity and strongly tempted the man with the scar.</p>
 <p>“She is princess Zhao Yang, the one who Xi Qi has sent for a marriage alliance and is Nan Lin <em>wang’s wangfei</em>. Nan Lin <em>wang&nbsp;</em>favors her the most. As long as you keep her, Nan Lin <em>wang&nbsp;</em>will certainly come with a lot of money to redeem her! It’s the truth!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die pushed Murong Qi Qi till she was in front of the man with the scar.</p>
 <p>“Nan Lin <em>wang&nbsp;</em>is in Yongzhou. Feng Cang will certainly give you money!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar seemed very interested in what Mu Yu Die had said. He looked at Murong Qi Qi from head to toe for a long time. In the end, he nodded.</p>
 <p>“She does have some air of princess. She's much stronger than that ugly woman!”</p>
 <p>Hearing the man with the scar talking like this about her, Wanyan Bao Zhu wished she could go forward and give him a slap in the face, but she was&nbsp;grabbed tightly by Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>“Princess, if you don’t endure the small things, you will spoil the big thing!”</p>
 <p>Although, she had been pulled into a pit today by Wanyan Bao Zhu, but her emperor father was her grandfather’s biggest head. Between Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Bao Zhu, Mu Yu Die of course will save Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>Only after hearing Mu Yu Die say that, did Wanyan Bao Zhu stop. She didn’t say anything. She only swept her eyes&nbsp;once again at Murong Qi Qi. Her gaze was like daggers.</p>
 <p>“You guys won’t lie, right?!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar touched his moustache and circled once around Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“She being a hostage really is not bad. It’s just, why should I believe you? The saying is that a woman’s heart is like a needle in the sea. In case Feng Cang came with soldiers to encircle us, what then?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that the man with the scar still didn’t want to let her go, Mu Yu Die gritted her teeth. She took out her personal jade pendant.</p>
 <p>“This is my jade pendant. I’m the eldest miss of the prime minister. If I breach my words, you can take my jade pendant to slander my reputation!”</p>
 <p>In order to survive, Mu Yu Die could only take this step. In this era, a jade pendant was a personal item and couldn’t be shown&nbsp;to people easily. If given to a man, it meant that they&nbsp;had set their love. Now, Mu Yu even took out her jade pendant, it appears that she really was eager to leave here.</p>
 <p>“Mu Yu Die? Good name!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar hooked Mu Yu Die’s pendant and brought it in front of him. He looked at the words on the pendant and read them out. He put it on his nose and sniffed.</p>
 <p>“En, smells good, ah!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Boss, what kind of smell does it has? Let me also smell it!”</p>
 <p>The shorty shouted again, while the others were booing.</p>
 <p>The scarred man's frivolous appearance made Mu Yu Die blush. That had been something she wore closely. Now, it’s being treated so disrespectfully, Mu Yu Die really wanted to kill him!</p>
 <p>“Where is yours?!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar put away the jade pendant and looked at Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>“Leave the person or leave the keepsake!”</p>
 <p>Although unwilling, but since there was no other way, Wanyan Bao Zhu could only take out her princess’s jade seal.</p>
 <p>“This is <em>bengong’s&nbsp;</em>seal. It can be used as a certificate!”</p>
 <p>“Wanyan Bao Zhu…...”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar looked for a long time at the phoenix carved jade.</p>
 <p>“Zeze, didn’t expect that you really are a princess! Alright, this thing is not bad! I will keep it!</p>
 <p>“Then we can leave?!”</p>
 <p>Hearing the scarred man that, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die asked eagerly.</p>
 <p>“People, bring two horses for princess Bao Zhu and miss Yu Die!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar gestured with his hand. Immediately, someone led two horses over and threw the ropes at Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>“The two of you better remember your promise! Three day laters, I want to see ten thousand golden teals here, otherwise this princess Zhao Yang’s life may not be guaranteed!”</p>
 <p>“Yes! We know. We know!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die climbed onto their horses. On their mouths hung a sneer. They wished Murong Qi Qi could die. Why would they come back with the ransom?!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi, go to hell! Wanyan Bao Zhu looked at Murong Qi Qi mercilessly for one last time. She whipped once and rushed back to Yongzhou.</p>
