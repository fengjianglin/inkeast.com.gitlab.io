 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 125 Monstrous jealousy (1)</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Yi was a bit gloomy that Murong Qi Qi didn’t treat him warmly like Wanyan Kang, but he didn’t show it.</p>
 <p>Presumably, because since young, the things he got were always the best; his little brother Wanyan Kang got those he(WY) didn’t want. That was why, his heart was always high above others. Now, suddenly getting a cold face from Murong Qi Qi, he truly wasn’t accustomed.</p>
 <p>Lin Ke Xin saw Murong Qi Qi’s cold attitude towards Wanyan Yi. Then, seeing that there was talking and laughing between Murong Qi Qi and Wanyan Kang, Lin Ke Xin was a bit worried. Could it be that Wanyan Kang was <em>the pavilion closest to the water enjoys the moonlight first</em> and acted in advance? How could this be right! Murong Qi Qi is the <em>second </em>daughter-in-law, she took a fancy on. She’s (MQQ) Wanyan Yi’s imperial consort, how could she marry Wanyan Kang?!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>The pavilion closes to the water enjoys the moonlight first: benefit from intimacy with a close person. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>The second here refers to WY being the second son of WL, although he’s the first son of LKX. Children are counted from the paternal line. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>At this point, Lin Ke Xin had disgust for her younger son Wanyan Kang. Little brother stealing big brother’s bride, such a scheme, such tactics; she really misjudged her younger son! Didn’t expect that Wanyan Kang who was usually all of smiles would have thoughts about the throne. Really hateful!</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi gave a cold shoulder to Wanyan Yi and only talked with Wanyan Kang, making Wanyan Yi very awkward. Several times, he wanted to intervene, but didn’t know what to say. For the first time, that kind of setback emerged in Wanyan Yi’s heart. He truly didn’t like this feeling.</p>
 <p>Just as Wanyan Yi wanted to pull his and Murong Qi Qi’s relation closer, a “His highness, the crown prince arrived! Her highness the crown princess arrived! Princess Bao Zhu arrived!” came in. With the arrival of these three, Jingxin hall became livelier.</p>
 <p>When Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu saw Murong Qi Qi, immediately feelings of envy, hate and jealousy emerged in their heart. In this world, there was actually such a beautiful and touching person. She abruptly defeated the two of them (in looks).</p>
 <p>Before marriage, Yu Shi Shi was a famous beauty Bei Zhou. However, compared to Murong Qi Qi, she has a lesser aura and got more ordinary. Also, when Wanyan Bao Zhu was Murong Xin Lian, she had the title of the number one beauty of Xi Qi’s capital. However, in front of Murong Qi Qi, even she felt ashamed because that kind of quick-witted was what she lacked the most.</p>
 <p>Now, the feelings Wanyan Bao Zhu had towards Murong Qi Qi was not the kind of hatred from before. They were more like seeing her as her enemy and also wanting to destroy the other party.</p>
 <p>She already heard about the matter of Murong Tai and Li Qiu Shui. She didn’t expect that Murong Qi Qi’s identity was so noble and was far from what she could compare to. Originally, she thought about how to step on Murong Qi Qi in the future. However, now it seems that it was just her wishful thinking and extravagant hope.</p>
 <p>“Little cousin sister Feng...,” Since Wanyan Hong came in, his eyes didn’t leave Murong Qi Qi. The day before, Murong Qi Qi wore a red palace dress and looked more beautiful than imagined. Today, she wore a yellow dress. It was fresh and pleasant, giving away another flavor.</p>
 <p>“Greetings to big cousin brother!” Like with Wanyan Yi, Murong Qi Qi only softly answered with one sentence. It was not cold nor warm, not close nor far. Murong Qi Qi’s attitude let Lin Ke Xin be a bit more at ease. Fortunately, her attitude towards Wanyan Hong was the same. It seemed that Murong Qi Qi’s heart didn’t have someone she fancied.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong didn’t even mind the slightest about Murong Qi Qi’s attitude. Well, woman needs to have character! In his view, Murong Qi Qi’s alienation was a character. It was stronger than those women who immediately jumped in his arms when they know he’s the crown prince.</p>
 <p>“When did little cousin sister arrive?”</p>
 <p>“Just now…”</p>
 <p>“Oh…,” Wanyan Hong looked thoughtfully at Wanyan Kang and then looked at Wanyan Yi. He was just about to say something, when he heard Jing De’s voice, “The emperor has arrived!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie came? Lin Ke Xin’s heart burst of excitement. She immediately led the bunch of people to welcome the emperor.</p>
 <p>The one who came with Wanyan Lie was Feng Cang. After the morning court meeting, Feng Cang couldn’t let go of his worries. So, he came with Wanyan Lie. After seeing that Murong Qi Qi was safe and sound, did he let out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“Brother…,” When everyone was bowing and shouting long live ten thousand years, Murong Qi Qi rushed to Feng Cang like a little bird.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you wear more when coming out? Where’s the heater? Why didn’t you bring it?” Feng Cang took of his fox fur coat and put it on Murong Qi Qi. Then, he put her small hands in his big palms.</p>
 <p>The relation between these ‘siblings’, aside from letting people be envious, in their eyes, it also had another layer of meaning. Once the husband and wife, now became siblings. Don’t know how these two people changed their roles so quickly. However, looking at their intimacy, they seemed to be closer than siblings. It seemed that relationship was not so easy to put down.</p>
 <p>The strange siblings in the eyes of others, in Wanyan Lie’s eyes was something happy. Their relationship was so great and they were so close, making Wanyan Lie a bit envious. Looking at Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, he thought about himself and Wanyan Ming Yue.</p>
 <p>From beginning to end, his feelings for Wanyan Ming Yue were buried in his heart. He could only forever look at her from afar. Now, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi’s relationship was so great; he had a feeling that he found an intimate friend. His dream wasn’t realized. How great would it be if it could realize on this pair of siblings…?</p>
 <p>He and Wanyan Ming Yue ended in a tragedy. If the people who are now experienced the same thing as them, also be broken up, then wouldn’t it be too pitiful? In the past, he didn’t get happiness. However now, he has the power to let people get happiness. If these two children really love each other, then he’ll support them!</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie had long forgotten how much he hated Feng Cang and also forgotten how he even more hated Feng Xie who got Wanyan Ming Yue’s heart. All these years, every time when he thought about how Wanyan Ming Yue became someone else’s bride, his heart would get very cold. That was why, he used all means to get revenge through Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>Now, he threw away all those things he did to Feng Cang in the back of his brain. What he saw was now a pair of bitter lovers like him in the past…</p>
 <p>More than once, Wanyan Lie hated from the bottom of his heart that in his body flow he same blood as Wanyan Ming Yue. If they weren’t siblings, he would certainly fight over her with Feng Xie and would certainly get Wanyan Ming Yue’s heart. He would become a pair of ideal lovers with her. However, he couldn’t change his identity and also couldn’t change his fate. This was the thing he hated the most!</p>
 <p>Now, seeing Feng Cang repeat his road and was like the him of the past, Wanyan Lie had the feeling that their hearts beat as one.</p>
 <p>However, Feng Cang is happier than him because at the same time Feng Cang likes Murong Qi Qi, Murong Qi Qi also likes him. They’re each other’s sunshine. However, they also couldn’t change the fact that they have the same blood. No matter how much they struggle, they couldn’t change their identity as siblings.</p>
 <p>Why are tragedies always repeated? A trace of compassion emerged in Wanyan Lie’s heart. It was sympathy towards Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi, this pair of unfortunate lovers. At the same time, there was also a trace of support for them.</p>
 <p>After all, in the past Feng Cang said the vow, “<em>Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it</em>.” And the him of that year, wasn’t he the same as today’s Feng Cang?!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it: there are so many potential lovers to choose from, but you only pick one from among those potential lovers.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Li: Chinese mile: 500 meters</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi didn’t know Wanyan Lie’s thoughts. If they knew, they would’ve been very taken aback! It was said, accompanying one’s sovereign is the same as accompanying a tiger. An emperor’s heart is the most difficult to guess. It had been like this since ancient time. Wanyan Lie was also like that.</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, come, let uncle take a look!” Wanyan Lie lovingly beckoned Murong Qi Qi. When she approached, Wanyan Lie nodded while looking, “Looks like your mother. Really looks like your mother!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t know why, but she didn’t feel disgust from Wanyan Lie’s eyes. Instead, she could sense that the care and concern in this person’s eyes were real. Really strange…Questions rose in Murong Qi Qi’s heart. If the matter of that year was done by Wanyan Lie, if everything that happened to Feng Cang was ‘thanks’ to Wanyan Lie, why when facing her, would he be so indulgent?</p>
 <p>How would Murong Qi Qi know that after Wanyan Lie saw her and Feng Cang’s affection, Wanyan Lie’s got the idea to support them and also came up with a plan.</p>
 <p>“Emperor, come inside. It’s cold outside!”</p>
 <p>“Good! Qi Qi, let’s go. Let’s go inside and don’t get a cold! Our Bei Zhou’s weather is not comparable to that of Xi Qi’s!”</p>
 <p>Lin Ke Xin was somewhat jealous at Wanyan Lie’s concern for Murong Qi Qi. The emperor has many children, but she never saw him be so amiable before and use such a gentle voice towards anyone. Instead, he was like this when facing Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Feng clan already got too much imperial grace. Feng Cang held the military power and is someone who could produce clouds with one turn of the hand and rain with another in Bei Zhou. Now, there’s one more Murong Qi Qi. Then, wouldn’t Feng clan’s power reach the skies?</p>
 <p>After entering the hall, Murong Qi Qi sat next to Feng Cang. Although, they only didn’t see each other for a moment, but to both, it felt like a long time had passed. Everyone saw the exchange of amorous glances between these siblings very clearly and they also understood clearly. In their hearts, they were puzzled if these siblings truly couldn’t go back to proper human relationship.</p>
 <p>“Nan Lin <em>wang</em>[1. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] and little cousin sister’s relationship is so great! Making people envious!” Wanyan Yi faintly said that. He wasn’t a fool. How could the feelings Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi’s eyes conveyed be that of siblings? It was obviously that of lovers!</p>
 <p>Although Wanyan Yi wanted to marry Murong Qi Qi, because getting Murong Qi Qi meant getting the world. However, he was more willing to defeat Feng Cang. After all, a <em>wang</em> of a different surname holding military power is not a good thing for the whole court.</p>
 <p>Even if in the future, he became the emperor, Murong Qi Qi became the empress and Feng Cang became his brother-in-law, but in history there were more than enough cases where the brother-in-law usurped the throne! He wouldn’t let his guard down just because he got the beauty and in the end, lose the country.</p>
 <p>What if by chance, Murong Qi Qi was a beautiful bait Feng Cang put out and the motive of these siblings was to get the country? Then, wouldn’t he lose very badly?</p>
 <p>Now, in Wanyan Yi’s point of view, Murong Qi Qi was a drug which exuded temptation. If getting addicted and fell into some people’s trap, in the end, he would lose more. However, if he could use this drug to deal with Feng Cang and at the same time win the power in one swoop, then it would be half the work, but twice the effect!</p>
 <p>Wanyan Yi forgot that Feng Cang’s power was given by Wanyan Lie. He also has forgotten that Murong Qi Qi’s identity was raised by Wanyan Lie. His whole mind was thinking about how to deal with Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi; how would he know that the boss above him would or wouldn’t let such a thing happen?</p>
 <p>“Flesh and blood were separated for so many years. Now, they identified each other, naturally they would be close. If siblings weren’t close to each other, then wouldn’t it be unreasonable?”</p>
 <p>The one who spoke for Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi was actually Wanyan Lie. These let the two involved parties surprised and also let the others see Wanyan Lie’s love for them.</p>
 <p>In just a moment, Wanyan Hong decided. He must get Murong Qi Qi. This person is a beauty; he likes that. The meaning behind this person; he likes that even more.</p>
 <p>Yesterday, when Chun Xing came to East palace to find him, she said those words from the empress.</p>
 <p>“Your emperor father had always wished to get a daughter like princess Ming Yue. Moreover, he said if the daughter is like Ming Yue, he would certainly give the world to her. Now, the emergence of Feng Qi Qi let your emperor father’s wish be fulfilled. No matter what, you need to get Murong Qi Qi. Even if you couldn’t get her heart, you need to get her body. By then, your emperor father would give this world as the dowry of princess Zhen Guo to you!”</p>
 <p>Although it was a fact that empress Li Bing was not favored, but Wanyan Hong knew, as the woman who accompanied emperor father the longest, empress mother was able to hold on the phoenix seal and also her position was never shaken, she must have her own ability.</p>
 <p>Just the thought of that red gecko cinnabar mark on Murong Qi Qi’s snow-white arm, Wanyan Hong was so excited. He had seen many women, but one with such white and soft skin, Murong Qi Qi was the first one.</p>
 <p>Just now, when Wanyan Yi ‘provoked’ that Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi’s relationship was like that of lovers and not of siblings, Wanyan Hong sensed the anger from emperor father. It could be seen that the place Feng siblings had in emperor’s heart was very heavy. He had to admit, sometimes, Feng Cang’s status was even above his.</p>
 <p>If he could marry Murong Qi Qi, that means that the throne is in his hand and the beauty in his arms. Besides, he would have a brother-in-law with military power. Although this brother-in-law wouldn’t be willing to be manipulated, but he could use Murong Qi Qi to restrict Feng Cang!</p>
 <p>Seeing Feng Cang’s expression, he certainly loves Murong Qi Qi to the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>If he controlled Murong Qi Qi, does he even need to be afraid to not be in control of Feng Cang? Even if by then, Feng Cang had the mind to usurp the throne, he could throw Murong Qi Qi out. By then, Feng Cang would lose his reputation and would lose the hearts of the commoners. Even if he (FC) had the ability, he wouldn’t be able to get out of his (WH) palms!</p>
 <p>However, in order to get Murong Qi Qi, the first one he needed to get rid of is the one who had the position of crown princess, Yu Shi Shi…He need to let her get off that position. Otherwise, if he let Murong Qi Qi get the position of <em>cefei</em>[2. Cefei: second ranked consort of the prince of first rank or the crown prince], emperor father wouldn’t be satisfied. Instead of waiting for emperor father to act, he may as well act first. Maybe by then, he could even get a good impression in front of Wanyan Lie.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong and Wanyan Yi, this pair of imperial brother’s thought were contrary to each other. Yu Shi Shi and Wanyan Bao Zhu, these two women’s thought were amazingly very similar.</p>
 <p>From Murong Qi Qi, Yu Shi Shi saw an unprecedented crisis. She saw the desire from Wanyan Hong’s eyes clearly. This man is someone ruthless and unscrupulous. If his heart was bent on marrying Murong Qi Qi and disposing herself, what should she do? On whom can she still depend on now?</p>
 <p>Because Murong Qi Qi threatened her position, Yu Shi Shi considered her, her number one enemy. And Wanyan Bao Zhu, at this moment just hate everything about Murong Qi Qi. In the past, she (MQQ) was Murong household’s legitimate daughter and was above her (WBZ). Now, she’s Bei Zhou’s princess Zhen Guo and was even more above her. How could Wanyan Bao Zhu accept this?</p>
 <p>Why was Murong Qi Qi’s life better than hers? Why was it that Murong Qi Qi was always more advantageous than her? She refused to accept that!</p>
 <p>Now, Wanyan Bao Zhu and Longze Jing Tian’s wedding <em>didn’t even have the first stroke of the character eight</em>, but it was already certain that Murong Qi Qi’s future would be Bei Zhou’s empress. This was obviously above her again. How could Wanyan Bao Zhu’s competitive heart accept this?! Time after time, she was oppressed and stepped on by Murong Qi Qi. When would such days end?</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Didn’t even have the first stroke of the character eight: things have not begun to take a shape</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>She wasn’t resigned, resigned that everything about Murong Qi Qi was stronger than her!</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was very strange. Murong Qi Qi took everything from the others into her eyes. No matter if it was envy, jealousy, hate, or unwilling to be reconciled and calculations; all of these made her feel that it was funny. Originally, she didn’t want to participate in anything. However, she had been put in this place by Wanyan Lie. She couldn’t not face these. Thinking of it, she’s the most innocent one.</p>
 <p>Since this identity brought her a lot of trouble; if she didn’t use her identity to show off once, wouldn’t she put those deep meaning in these people’s eyes to shame?</p>
 <p>“Uncle, eunuch Jing De said Long Autumn palace is the most beautiful place of the harem, is that right?”</p>
 <p>The emotions in the people’s eyes, directly teased out Murong Qi Qi’s rebellious heart. The more people are jealous of her getting the imperial love, then should would let this love be worthy of its name!</p>
 <p>“That’s right! What, do you want to go take a look?” From the tone of Murong Qi Qi, she seemed to be interested in Long Autumn palace. Wanyan Lie was very happy.</p>
 <p>Before the battle at Yandang mountain, Wanyan Lie already emptied Long Autumn palace. Even though, he knew that Long Autumn palace was the residence of the empress since ancient times, but he still refused to bestow it to Li Bing. In Wanyan Lie’s heart only Wanyan Ming Yue was worthy of living in Long Autumn palace. Until later, when he placed Wanyan Ming Yue in the underground of Long Autumn palace, only then did he get those women.</p>
 <p>Now, Wanyan Ming Yue’s daughter Murong Qi Qi returned. Of course, he should ‘return it back to its rightful owner’ and let Murong Qi Qi live there. In the past, how much did he wish for her mother to live there. Although, this wish couldn’t be fulfilled, but that didn’t mean he gave up.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Ming Yue had been in a deep sleep for so long and refused to wake up to look at him. If she knew that her daughter was found, if he let her hear stories about Murong Qi Qi and hear Murong Qi Qi’s voice, would she forgive the things he had done and would wake up?</p>
 <p>“Alright! Anyway, sitting is also quite boring!” While Murong Qi Qi spoke, she stood up. Feng Cang put the cloak on for her. He also considerately prepared a heater and gave it to Murong Qi Qi. Until after, she got everything done, was he assured.</p>
 <p>This intimate move of these siblings changed taste in everyone’s eyes. Only Wanyan Lie was delighted. It seemed that he saw his younger self and the young gorgeous Wanyan Ming Yue.</p>
 <p>“You all don’t have to go! <em>Zhen </em>[3. Zhen: I, used by the emperor] will accompany Qi Qi there! Cang <em>er</em>, you also take a rest. With <em>zhen</em> here, no one would bully Qi Qi!” When Feng Cang put on the fox fur coat and was about to go together, Wanyan Lie said that. He excluded everyone other than Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie wanted to be alone with Murong Qi Qi? This let Feng Cang’s heart be alarmed. After all, Wanyan Lie did many black-hearted things towards Feng family. If he wanted to do something against Murong Qi Qi, then what should he do?!</p>
 <p>“Big Brother, wait here for me!” Murong Qi Qi smiled sweetly at Feng Cang and gave him reassurance. If Wanyan Lie wanted to do something to her, she would just take his head and regard it as revenge for Feng Xie and Wanyan Ming Yue. Then, she could also leave here sooner with Feng Cang.</p>
 <p>Following Wanyan Lie, a bunch of people mightily went to Long Autumn palace. When they arrived at Long Autumn palace, Wanyan Lie let the servants stop and only went inside with Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Have to say, this Long Autumn palace was the most the most extravagant with gold and jade glorious splendor, Murong Qi Qi had ever seen. It was way more splendid than the hall Wanyan Lie used for court meetings. What let Murong Qi Qi be surprised was that this Long Autumn palace was filled with plum blossom.</p>
