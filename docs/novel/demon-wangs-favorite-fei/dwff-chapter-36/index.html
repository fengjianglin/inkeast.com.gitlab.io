 <p>Chapter 36 Nan Feng’s crown prince</p>
 <p>“Ming Yue Cheng is Nan Feng country’s crown prince. It’s already been ten years since he came to Xi Qi as a hostage,” whispered Shangguan Wu Ji to Murong Qi Qi after Ming Yue Cheng came on board.</p>
 <p>Hostage? Crown prince? Is that not a prisoner… … Murong Qi Qi stared thoughtfully at Ming Yue Cheng.</p>
 <p>A pair of wooden clogs, barefoot. Simple purple clothes, casually bound together with a knot, revealing a bronzed chest. A wine gourd is hanging at his waist. A silver purple ribbon simply tied his black hair together. A pair of unruly eyes floated across the crowd. When they looked at Murong Qi Qi, he nodded slightly at her in greeting. Then his eyes rested on Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>“Greetings to <em>wangye</em>[1. Wangye/ wang: prince of first rank]!”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng greeted and didn’t care so much about etiquette. He sat directly on the floor and took the jug of wine at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Good wine……”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Longze Jing Tian to open his mouth, Ming Yue Cheng raised his head and poured the good wine into his mouth.</p>
 <p>This man is interesting! Murong Qi Qi thought in her heart.</p>
 <p>Looks like this is an era of young, handsome men. Every man on this boat, which one is not a fine specimen? Longze Jing Tian is noble, Shangguan Wu Ji is heroic, Li Yun Qing is elegant, Bai Mu Fei is handsome and this crown prince Ming Yue Cheng, who is in dire straits, also has another air.</p>
 <p>Don’t know how that husband of hers, whom she had never met, looks like. The rumors say that Nan Lin <em>wang</em> is Bei Zhou’s most handsome man. There are also people who say he is the number first beauty of the world. Don’t know if these rumors are true or false……</p>
 <p>Those girls didn’t seem to put Ming Yue Cheng into their eyes. After all, one’s not an optimistic hostage, even if it’s a crown prince, so what? It’s still a question whether he can or cannot return to Nan Feng. Let alone talking about a future!</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>this is good wine, can you gift it to me?”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng drank enough of the wine but didn’t seem to be satisfied. He looked somewhat cravingly at the jug of wine in front of Longze Jing Tian. It’s like a cat seeing a fish.</p>
 <p>“My treasure hasn’t encountered such good wine in a long time!” <em>(TN: his treasure is probably his jug)</em></p>
 <p>While talking, Ming Yue Cheng took down the jug at his waist as if it was the world’s most precious thing. It attracted Longze Yu Er’s ridicule.</p>
 <p>“Imperial brother, since he is so greedy, why don’t you reward it to him lest people say we are bullying a hostage!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu Er’s contempt attracted the girls’ laughter. Only Bai Yi Yue is sitting quietly as if it’s not a matter of concern.</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng acted like he didn’t hear the ridicule in Longze Yu Er’s words and continued to stare at the jug with hungry eyes.</p>
 <p>“Ah…..”</p>
 <p>The other party’s expression seemed to make Longze Jing Tian happy. He waved his hands and let people bring a jar of wine in front of Ming Yue Chen.</p>
 <p>“For you!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you <em>wangye</em>! Thank you <em>wangye</em>!”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Chen excitedly said thanks two times. A moment later, he acted like he couldn’t believe that Longze Jing Tian would be so generous and asked: “Are you really giving them to me?”</p>
 <p>That cautious look made Longze Jing Tian laugh: “I said to reward them to you, then they are yours!”</p>
 <p>“Thanks! Thanks!”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng impatiently filled his jug with wine. Then he carefully closed the jars.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I’ll drink it slowly when I go back! Such a good wine needs to be carefully savored!”</p>
 <p>“En, you can leave first!”</p>
 <p>After teasing Ming Yue Cheng, Longze Jing Tian’s heart, which had been affected by Murong Qi Qi, seemed a lot better.</p>
 <p>“You can go!”</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Cheng carefully handed a jar of wine over to Fu Er and took the other half-filled jar of wine into his embrace. Another hand held the ladder as he left the boat. Don’t know if it’s done on purpose or it’s just an accident but the boat suddenly shook two times. Ming Yue Cheng hadn’t held onto the ladder well and went straight into the lake.</p>
 <p>“Your highness!”</p>
 <p>Fu Er anxiously extended a paddle to lift Ming Yue Cheng up, but he didn’t expect that Ming Yue Cheng would firstly put the half-filled jar of wine onto the boat.</p>
 <p>“My wine! Don’t let my wine become spoiled!”</p>
 <p>“Pu chi……”</p>
 <p>Seeing Ming Yue Cheng being so useless, Murong Qing Lian laughed.</p>
 <p>“I really never saw such a crown prince. He doesn’t even deserve to clean<em> wangye’s </em>shoes!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian’s words received everyone’s approval. In their eyes, this crown prince of Nan Feng country was just a loser.</p>
 <p>However, was he really a loser? Murong Qi Qi looked thoughtfully at Ming Yue Chen, whose whole body had become wet and after climbing onto the boat, was still giggling at the crowd. This person was really interesting……</p>
 <p>“Third little sister, drink some green bean soup. It’s refreshing.”</p>
 <p>After the farce, Murong Xin Lian smilingly came up, holding a bowl of green bean soup.</p>
 <p>“Drink, ah!”</p>
 <p>“No need!”</p>
 <p>Just from smelling it, Murong Qi Qi knew that something had been added to this green bean soup. But this time, she’s too lazy to play with Murong Xin Lian. She directly put her hand up to refuse.</p>
 <p>“I can’t afford to drink second big sister green bean soup. In the past, I drank second big sister's wine and almost did something wrong. Today, if I really drink this green bean soup, maybe I will fall into the lake and won’t even know how I will die.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi being so direct made Murong Xin Lian’s face turn from blue to red and then back to blue. She didn’t expect that Murong Qi Qi would not give her face and directly say that out loud.</p>
 <p>Looking once again, Longze Jing Tian seemed to have heard Murong Qi Qi’s words. He looked at her while frowning, making Murong Xin Lian’s heart feel even more hatred. But on her face, she couldn’t not put a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>“Third little sister, you really love to joke around!”</p>
 <p>“Second big sister, everyone knows how our relationship is. There’s no need to act so artificial. All these years, I accompanied you to act. I’m tired of acting. Now second big sister you got your wish, little sister also has a place to go to. Today, I saw how harmonious second big sister and brother-in-law are living with each other, I can now be at ease.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi walked to the center of the boat and bowed at everyone.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi thanks everyone for your care. If in the past there were some unpleasantness, please forgive me. In the future, the mountains are high and the water is long, we won’t have a chance to see each other again. Today, I will borrow brother-in-law <em>wangye’s </em>name and will see this as a farewell banquet for me. This cup of wine is me making amends to everyone!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi drank the cup of wine and showed everyone the empty cup.</p>
 <p>“Su Yue, let’s leave!”</p>
 <p>Just as everyone's wondering why Murong Qi Qi was saying that, a small boat pulled over. The one on the boat is Feng Yu.</p>
 <p>“Princess, it’s the time for learning. Asking princess to go back!”</p>
 <p>“Needs to trouble aunty!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi and Feng Yu are talking in Bei Zhou’s language. Longze Jing Tian is really surprised. Just in a few days, Murong Qi Qi can already speak Bei Zhou’s language so well. Is this young maiden really the rubbish that everyone talks about?</p>
 <p>This question already had no way of being answered. Murong Qi Qi had gotten&nbsp;on the small boat.</p>
 <p>Seeing the small boat move further away, Longze Jing Tian once again heard the cries deep in his heart. Keep her, otherwise, you will regret it! This voice came unexpectedly. Even Longze Jing Tian couldn’t control it. When he came out of the daze, the beauty was already far away.</p>
 <p>When the boat reached the shore, Murong Qi Qi handed a letter to Su Yue to let her give it to Ming Yue Cheng.</p>
 <p>At the other end, Ming Yue Cheng also reached the shore. Seeing the letter Su Yue had sent, Ming Yue Cheng was somewhat puzzled.</p>
 <p>“Our family miss said that your highness is no ordinary person. She hopes that your highness wakes up soon.”</p>
 <p>Su Yue left Ming Yue Cheng’s vision smilingly.</p>
