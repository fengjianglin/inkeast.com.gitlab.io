 <p>Chapter 67 The empress dowager’s harsh conditions (1)</p>
 <p>“Wishing empress dowager good health!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi paid her respects to Dongfang Lan according to how Feng Yu had taught her.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi could sense the hostility Dongfang Lan had against her, which was related to the grudges of the previous generation. She, more or less, had an understanding of it. So she cannot let the other party find a thorn in her etiquette!</p>
 <p>“Mm!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s etiquette was at its place. The gestures were generous without losing nobility. Dongfang Lan couldn’t pick any faults. Therefore, she nodded slightly so as to show her satisfaction.</p>
 <p>“You are a child who knows etiquette. You’ve been trained well!”</p>
 <p>“Thanking empress dowager!”</p>
 <p>Although she couldn’t pick out any faults, but this didn’t mean that Dongfang Lan would let Murong Qi Qi off. However, she's an empress dowager. If she really made matters difficult for Murong Qi Qi, not only would she offend Xi Qi, but also let people make a controversy of it and say she is small-minded. Fortunately, she prepared earlier. That’s why she brought along these two beauties.</p>
 <p>Among these two beauties, Murong Qi Qi has seen one. It’s Wanyan Bao Zhu, Bei Zhou’s princess and Bei Zhou’s flower. The other is the prime minister’s granddaughter. People call her the most talented woman of Bei Zhou, Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>The two both have good feelings towards Feng Cang. Mu Yu Die was twenty years old and hadn’t married yet. She was bent on waiting for Feng Cang. Since Dongfang Lan brought them here, it’s apparent that she didn’t want to make Murong Qi Qi look good.</p>
 <p>“I heard that princess came from a scholarly family. Don’t know what kind of books princess usually reads?”</p>
 <p>The one asking is Mu Yu Die. She has a white face, dignified features. Her body has a scholarly aura. Plus, the fact that she was wearing white, she looked like an orchid on a mountain stream. Very elegant.</p>
 <p>However, relying on the fact that her grandfather is the prime minister, Mu Yu Die’s eyes has a hint of harsh aristocratic pride, ruining her overall beauty and making it her flaw.</p>
 <p>The other party was acting so aggressive in front of so many people. The empress dowager must’ve given her permission. Murong Qi Qi didn’t know which rumors about&nbsp;her these people know. But in a situation where she doesn’t know the other party’s bottom line, going head to head isn’t a good idea.</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi answered somewhat ‘cowardly’: “Woman with no talent is virtuous. I only know a few words.”</p>
 <p>After Murong Qi Qi’s words fell, there was laughter. The one who laughed is none other than Mu Yu Die. She had long heard that this Murong Qi Qi was&nbsp;a rubbish of ignorance. Originally, she wanted to embarrass her today; let her become a fool in public. She didn’t expect that she (MQQ) would admit it all on her own.</p>
 <p>Know only a few words? Then, doesn’t this mean that she is no different from farmers?! How can such a person be worthy of Feng Cang? She is not even worthy to clean Feng Cang’s shoes!</p>
 <p>“What, does this lady feel that what I'm saying isn’t right?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the sarcasm in the other party’s eyes, Murong Qi Qi acted&nbsp;as if she didn’t understand. Her eyes were clear and her smile was like rainbow. It’s so clean, it’s refreshing.</p>
 <p>“Before the departure, my mother repeatedly told me that women without talent were&nbsp;virtuous. Instead of reading those poetry and literature, it’s better to learn how to manage the house, how to be a qualified wife and how to obey the husband and teach the children. After marrying, obey the husband. Only husband is my sky. Should listen to husband in every way. Can it be that you think this isn’t right?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words made Dongfang Lan feel very comfortable. <em>Three obeys and four virtues </em>are the essential qualities of a woman. Of course, women must see their husband as the sky. Why does she need to understand so much? It’s more practical and reliable to be good to the husband and teach the children! It seemed that Murong Qi Qi’s mother isn’t a befuddled person and taught her well.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Three obeys and four virtues: Confucian moral injunctions for woman. Obey three men: father, husband and son. Plus, they need to have four virtues: morality, physical charm, proper&nbsp;in speech and efficiency in needlework. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>It’s very strange. When Dongfang Lan was young, she was a sloppy woman. She was not bound by etiquette. But now that she is old, she began to put importance on these and also asked the same from others. That’s why she was quite satisfied with Murong Qi Qi’s words. It could be considered that she passed on the virtues.</p>
 <p>“Well said! Indeed, needs to be like that!”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan nodded. Seeing Murong Qi Qi standing well-behaved there; her facial features are very common without a fox beauty, the dissatisfaction in Dongfang Lan’s heart calmed a bit.</p>
 <p>Her looks are ordinary. She looked like she knew her place well. These are alright. If she wasn’t Murong Tai’s daughter, she might have nodded at this marriage.</p>
 <p>Feng Cang felt somewhat surprised&nbsp;with&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi’s answer.</p>
 <p>With his understanding of Murong Qi Qi, she wasn’t simply as someone who only knew a few words……Looking at her again, Murong Qi Qi looked humble and full of humility. Feng Cang almost laughed out loud. He was worried that she wouldn’t pass, how could he forget that his little <em>wangfei</em>[1. Wangfei: main wife/consort of the prince of first rank] is someone who eats people?</p>
 <p>It's just that Mu Yu Die provoking Murong Qi Qi at such an occasion made him very unhappy.</p>
 <p>It seemed that he needs to go have a hearty talk with prime minister Mu. A woman staying at home at such an old age, she might have forgotten the etiquette. It’s time to find a husband for her!</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan’s appreciation made Mu Yu Die’s heart alarmed. She was thinking of poetry and wanted to show off her talents, but she had forgotten that empress dowager was&nbsp;most compliant with these ‘traditional virtues’.</p>
 <p>No wonder, the empress dowager knew that sh liked Feng Cang, but she never nodded. Could it be that this was the reason? Before, she was thinking of how to show off her literary grace and definitely suppress Murong Qi Qi. She didn’t expect that she <em>moved a stone to stub her own feet!</em> It seemed that she needs to hide her talent and be respectful. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to enter Nan Lin <em>wangfu</em>[2. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first rank]&nbsp;in this life, not to mention to be together with Feng Cang!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Moved a stone to stub her own feet: make a move which turned bad for oneself</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu was very happy seeing Mu Yu Die suffer defeat.</p>
 <p>Everyone in Yanjing capital knew that she and Mu Yu Die were competitors. Both liked Feng Cang. Although she's a princess, but Mu Yu Die was always on top of her because of her virtues and talents. This made Wanyan Bao Zhu very unhappy. She bore with it for a long time. Now she finally saw Mu Yu Die become embarrassed. Naturally, Wanyan Bao Zhu was happy.</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die was tactfully retorted by Murong Qi Qi, so Wanyan Bao Zhu came up with another question. She isn’t mindless as Mu Yu Die. These past few days, Wanyan Bao Zhu has been reading information about Murong Qi Qi. She thought for a long time before coming up with this question. It will surely embarrass Murong Qi Qi!</p>
 <p>“To be able to break the rule and be bestowed the title of princess, big sister&nbsp;must’ve extraordinary talents. Don’t know which level of martial arts did big sister reach?”</p>
 <p>“Martial arts. I don’t know martial arts,” Murong Qi Qi answered honestly.</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Wanyan Bao Zhu pretended to be surprised and put her hand before her mouth.</p>
 <p>“Doesn’t have any martial arts? Then, isn’t that a rubbish? Aiya, <em>bengong</em>[3. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family]&nbsp;is straightforward, big sister don’t take it too hard!”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang couldn’t help but frown at Wanyan Bao Zhu’s words. He has never had other ideas just because Murong Qi Qi doesn’t have martial arts. He loves Murong Qi Qi. He loves her for being her and not because of the benefits she can bring him. Those are just added values!</p>
 <p>Love shouldn’t be a bargain and also doesn’t need those added gorgeous adornments.</p>
 <p>Having this person at his side is better than anything! Besides, he is a man. Protecting his wife and children is something he should do. As long as he loves her, even if Murong Qi Qi doesn’t know anything, he wouldn’t mind. He decided that his marriage is not the goddamn business of others!</p>
 <p>Some of the rumors about Murong Qi Qi had long spread to Yanjing. Now that Murong Qi Qi&nbsp;admitted in public that she didn’t know any martial arts, the officials below couldn’t help but begin to murmur.</p>
 <p>Doesn’t have martial arts, doesn’t have literary talent; she doesn’t have anything, but has been promised to Feng Cang. Dongfang Lan was very unsatisfied. Plus, the fact that she saw Feng Cang protectiveness towards Murong Qi Qi and also let her live inside Tingsong Building, the package in her heart was already as big as the sea. She bore with it for a few days just to embarrass Murong Qi Qi today. That’s why Dongfang Lan didn’t stop Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>Since&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi admitted in public that she didn’t have any martial arts, Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her chin proudly.</p>
 <p>She is already a level four martial artist. Soon, she will enter the blue level five. No matter if it’s ability, family background or appearance, no one could be compared to her. Only she is worthy to be next to Feng Cang. As for Murong Qi Qi who doesn’t have anything, she can only be a rubbish to warm the bed. Where is she eligible to be Nan Lin <em>wangfei</em>?!</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s provocation is like a child’s grudge in Murong Qi Qi’s eyes. No matter how beautiful this butterfly is, it also needs the flower to be willing to bloom, ah! What’s the meaning of having an unrequited love? It’s simply a journey where an idiot goddess will grow.</p>
 <p>Seeing Wanyan Bao Zhu’s proud face, Murong Qi Qi’s brain moved and thought of a way to make her angry, but it needed Feng Cang’s coordination.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>[4. Wangye: prince of the first rank], aside from female work, cooking, taking care of the household and a loyal heart, Qi Qi doesn’t know any other thing and also doesn’t have any other thing, will you be dissatisfied with Qi Qi?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi didn’t directly answer Wanyan Bao Zhu, instead she looked pale-faced at Feng Cang, acting as if Feng Cang said a ‘no’, she would be completely disheartened. That delicate and pitiful appearance made people couldn’t help but love!</p>
 <p>“Qing Qing, how can <em>benwang</em>[5. Benwang: I, used by the prince of first rank]&nbsp;be dissatisfied with you?!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Murong Qi Qi, Feng Cang immediately showed his attitude. He come to her side and lovingly grabbed her hand.</p>
 <p>“Can it be that Qing Qing forgot about the assassination night? If it wasn’t because of Qing Qing took care of <em>benwang </em>without resting, how would <em>benwang </em>recover so fast?! The whole journey, Qing Qing took care of <em>benwang’s </em>necessities of life. Every day, you did it full of dedication and didn’t slack off for a moment. All of this,&nbsp;<em>benwang </em>took in my eyes and remembers in my heart. How is <em>benwang </em>a superficial person?!”</p>
 <p>The moment Murong Qi Qi listened to this, her whole body got a layer of goose bumps, but her face showed a look of happiness.</p>
 <p>Say she could act, now she feels that Feng Cang can act even more. What is taking care of him without resting? What is taking care of his necessities of life, full of dedication during the whole journey? How come those words, no matter how you listen to them, would make people think they had an affair……</p>
 <p>Just a few words from Feng Cang directly put Wanyan Bao Zhu into the category of ‘superficial’. Hearing that they were so intimate on the journey made Wanyan Bao Zhu so angry that she stomped her feet. She turned and pulled Dongfang Lan’s sleeves.</p>
 <p>“Grandmother, see how Cang <em>gege</em>[6. Gege: big brother] is talking!”</p>
 <p>“Cang <em>er</em>[7. Er: term of endearment], what did you just say? Did somebody go to assassinate you? When? Did you get injured?!”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan didn’t pay attention to the unhappiness of her granddaughter. Now she is most concerned about Feng Cang’s safety. Once she heard that the only blood left by her beloved daughter had encountered an assassination attempt, Dongfang Lan became anxious.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“Empress mother,&nbsp;it’s like this.”</p>
 <p>Emperor Wanyan Lie saw that his empress mother got angry, and worried that she would hurt her body from anger, quickly told her what happened.</p>
 <p>“<em>Zhen</em>[8. Zhen: I, used by an emperor]&nbsp;already sent people to investigate this matter. Empress mother, be assured. <em>Zhen </em>will definitely find the culprit!”</p>
 <p>When Wanyan Lie said ‘culprit’, Murong Qi Qi obviously sensed the coldness in Feng Cang. Could it be that he already knew who the culprit was? Why didn’t he say it in public? Or was&nbsp;there another hidden motive?</p>
 <p>Previously,&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi had looked at some information about Feng Cang. The information said that because Feng Cang was&nbsp;especially liked by Wanyan Lie, he once&nbsp;had the idea of dethroning the crown prince and let Feng Cang become the crown prince instead.</p>
 <p>Although in the end that matter hadn’t succeeded, but the relationship between crown prince Wanyan Hong and Feng Cang became very awkward.&nbsp; It was also said that Wanyan Hong has a deep-rooted hatred towards this Nan Lin <em>wang </em>who took his emperor father's&nbsp;love. Could this matter be done by the crown prince? But, second prince Wanyan Yi is also a popular contender for the crown prince’s possiton. Maybe he wanted to frame the crown prince……</p>
 <p>It seemed that Feng Cang wasn’t as bright as he looked like. Raised in the imperial family and being in such a sensitive position must’ve been really hard on him.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s fingertips gently tapped Feng Cang’s palm to let him not think too much. Sensing Murong Qi Qi’s concern, Feng Cang’s heart felt warm. He squeezed Murong Qi Qi’s hand to let her not worry, but the words coming out of his mouth were cornier.</p>
 <p>“Grandmother, I’m fine. It’s all thank to princess Zhao Yang taking care of me the whole journey. Speaking of it, she is my lucky star. Since the assassination attempt, <em>benwang </em>was safe after going to live in her tent. No other accidents happened after that.”</p>
 <p>Only now did Dongfang Lan see where the problem lay. Originally, she thought that the two were clear as water. She didn’t think that they had actually lived in the same carriage and tent.</p>
 <p>Now it’s impossible to return Murong Qi Qi or promise her to another. Besides, Feng Cang already has feelings for Murong Qi Qi. If she forcefully breaks them apart, she fears that Feng Cang wouldn’t agree.</p>
 <p>At this point, Dongfang Lan is in a dilemma.</p>
 <p>If she agrees, her heart will be troubled because of Murong Qi Qi’s identity. If she opposes, then she will get the name of being a betrayer. After all, Murong Qi Qi came to form a marriage alliance. Said it uglier, she came to <em>chongxi </em>for Feng Cang. She can’t go too overboard. This involves the politics of the two countries.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Chongxi: arrange a wedding for a very ill young man with the hope that the ’event of great joy’ will drive away his bad luck and hasten his recovery</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Moreover, something happened to all of the former women sent to Feng Cang. This time, Murong Qi Qi and Feng Cang stayed together for so long, but she is unscathed. Maybe her <em>bazi</em> can suppress the killing in Feng Cang’s <em>bazi......</em></p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Bazi: eight characters representing the year, month, day and hour of one’s birth. Every one of them has two characters which form eight characters. A bazi is used in fortune telling.</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Could it be that this is fate? Dongfang Lan is not happy and not willing to resign to this fate.</p>
 <p>However, Feng family’s bloodline needs to continue. Feng Cang is already twenty-five. Other men at his age already have sons and daughters. Only Feng Cang, while marrying one, he would curse one, making it now that nobody dares to marry him. Could it be that she really needs to let Murong Qi Qi enter Feng family? Let the future children of Feng family have the enemy’s blood in them?</p>
 <p>In just&nbsp;a moment, Dongfang Lan thought about a lot. The grandson in front of her, is the grandchild she loves the most. This child lost his parents at ten and also suffered from calculations of others which ruined his body. Very hard, he became an adult, but getting a granddaughter-in-law is so difficult…….</p>
 <p>Looking at Murong Qi Qi again; her skin is ordinary, her ability is ordinary, everything is ordinary. No matter how she looked at it, Murong Qi Qi is not worthy of Feng Cang. But she has entered Feng Cang’s eyes and also nothing happened to her when she stayed beside Feng Cang. Could it be that it’s enemies who will fall in love with each other?</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan hesitated and was silent for a long time. Only when Wanyan Bao Zhu called her, did she come out of a daze.</p>
 <p>“Just now, princess said you have a loyal heart. Did <em>aijia</em>[9. Aijia: I, used by an empress dowager]?”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan looked at Murong Qi Qi with sharp eyes.</p>
 <p>“You didn’t hear wrong.”</p>
 <p>“Then <em>aijia </em>asks you, are you now Xi Qi’s citizen or are you Bei Zhou’s citizen? If there’s conflict between the two countries, on which side will you stand?”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Lan’s words were very aggressive. Everyone could see that shes making things difficult for Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Answering empress dowager, no matter if it’s Xi Qi or Bei Zhou, they have nothing to do with me.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s magnanimous answer made people breath out loudly. Have nothing to do with her? What does this mean? Dongfang Lan frowned, but unexpectedly, Murong Qi Qi has more to say.</p>
 <p>“I only stand by <em>wangye’s </em>side. What <em>wangye </em>choose, I’ll choose.”</p>
 <p>A perfect answer, throwing the ball at Feng Cang. Now Feng Cang couldn’t help but love this little woman more! She knows how to stand in the shade of the big tree and throw all the problems to him, let him face them. Does this woman believe in him or does she only find them too troubling?</p>
 <p>“En,” Dongfang Lan nodded. No matter if Murong Qi Qi answered Xi Qi or Bei Zhou, she will leave something for people to use against her. Only answering like this is the best. It seems that she isn’t so stupid after all.</p>
 <p>If her heart is really thinking like that and sees Feng Cang as the sky, then Dongfang Lan will be at ease. It’s just that she (DL) doesn’t know if her (MQQ) mouth is saying something, but her heart is thinking otherwise.</p>
 <p>She is not a stubborn old lady. She spent one day to get to know about Murong Qi Qi. She (MQQ) is also a pitiful child! It’s just that no matter what, Murong Qi Qi is Murong Tai’s daughter. It’s also a fact that Feng Xie was defeated at Murong Tai’s hands!</p>
 <p>For so many years, Dongfang Lan often dreamed about Wanyan Ming Yue. Dreaming about her with Feng Xie carrying their child while standing full of blood in front of her and saying: “Empress mother needs to get revenge for Ming Yue! Needs to get revenge for Ming Yue!”</p>
