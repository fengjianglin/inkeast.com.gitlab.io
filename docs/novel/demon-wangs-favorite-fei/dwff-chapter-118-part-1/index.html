 <p><em>TLNote:Still unedited chapter.. &nbsp;This is the first part of chapter 118. The second part would be posted tomorrow.</em></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 118 The truth is so cruel (2) part 1</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>When Feng Cang arrived at the palace, the emperor, the empress dowager, the empress, consort De and crown princess Yu Shi Shi were also there. Everyone was waiting for them. With Wanyan Lie’s grace, Murong Qi Qi didn’t bow and only slightly paid her respect. Then, she was invited to sit down.</p>
 <p>“Not bad! Very great!” Wanyan Lie looked smilingly at Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi. He nodded repeatedly, “<em>Zhen</em>[1. Zhen: I, used by the emperor] feels happy for you!”</p>
 <p>“Thanking uncle!” Feng Cang answered smilingly, but his hand held Murong Qi Qi’s soft body. At this time, Murong Qi Qi had her head lowered. Her face showed a smile of shyness. With one look, you would know she was a new wife.</p>
 <p>Seeing Feng Cang being happy, inside Wanyan Lie’s heart appeared an indescribable feeling. For so many years, his plan had never failed. This time, because of that bitch Yue Lan Zhi, one step went wrong, all steps went wrong. It seemed that he needed to get into contact with Nan Feng country! Feng Cang’s happy smile was like a thorn, piercing his heart, making him bleed when he pulls that thorn out.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Lie was unhappy, Yu Shi Shi was even more unhappy. The man who originally belonged to her became Murong Qi Qi’s. The embrace which originally belonged to her became Murong Qi Qi’s. Seeing Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi show love towards each other in public, Yu Shi Shi’s nails dug deep in her palm.</p>
 <p>Just as Yu Shi Shi was staring at Feng Cang’s big hand which was holding Murong Qi Qi, a voice screamed, “Emperor, save me!” Then a girl stumbled and appeared in front of everyone. That girl’s hair was dishevelled. On her body were only a few pieces of fabric. She was barefoot and walked in a hurry as if she couldn’t feel the cold.</p>
 <p>“Save me!”</p>
 <p>When Murong Qing Lian entered and saw Wanyan Lie sitting in the front, all the grievances in her heart vented out, “Wa…,” She cried making everyone dumbfounded. Who was this woman? Why was she like this?</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian’s appearance made the gentle smile on Dongfang Lan stiffen. This was her grandson’s big day, how come such a woman appeared and dampened the spirit</p>
 <p>“Emperor, save me! Emperor, save me!”</p>
 <p>On the shoulders of Murong Qing Lian who had been tortured by Wanyan Hong for the whole night, were bloody teeth marks. Those purple and blue bruises were very shocking to the eyes, making Wanyan Lie frown. “Are you not Xi Qi’s contestant? How come you’re like this?”</p>
 <p>After Wanyan Lie said that, Lin Ke Xin remembered, “That’s right! Emperor, she is Murong Qing Lian. Speaking of this, she is Nan Lin <em>wangfei</em>’s[2. Wangfei: the main consort/wife of the prince of first rank] little sister. She’s Murong Tai’s youngest daughter!”</p>
 <p>Being mentioned by Lin Ke Xin, Murong Qi Qi could no longer pretend not to know. She could only ask people to bring some clothes to cover the bruises on Murong Qing Lian’s body.</p>
 <p>“Thank you…” After wearing clothes and put on socks and shoes, Murong Qing Lian felt a lot warmer. She ran all the way here. She took advantage that Wanyan Hong wasn’t paying attention and ran out. Just now, she was warm from running and didn’t feel the cold. Now, that she stopped running, she couldn’t help but shudder.</p>
 <p>“What had happened?” Wanyan Lie’s face was cold and looked at the pale faced Murong Qing Lian.</p>
 <p>“Emperor, save me…his highness the crown prince, he…”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian hadn’t finished speaking when a voice came over, “Emperor father, this subject son wants to marry miss Murong as a <em>cefei</em>[3. Cefei: Side consort, second ranked wife of the prince of first rank] !”</p>
 <p>Hearing Wanyan Hong’s voice, Murong Qing Lian’s body involuntarily trembled, “No! I don’t want! I don’t want to marry him! He’s a sicko! He, he raped me…woowoowoo…”</p>
 <p>A ‘rape’ made the crowd think back about those bruises on Murong Qing Lian’s body. They immediately understood what happened. Lin Ke Xin looked once heartfully at Murong Qing Lian. Then she looked once at Murong Qi.</p>
 <p>The two sisters of Murong family have good means, ah! The big sister married Nan Lin <em>wang</em>[4. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank], the little sister connected with the imperial crown prince. Truly powerful! Lin Ke Xin smiled and continued to maintain her gentle posture to watch a play.</p>
 <p>“Don’t want? Could it be you want to be the main consort?” Wanyan Hong slowly approached Murong Qing Lian. Seeing him approach, Murong Qing Lian couldn’t help but backed. In the end, she accidently tripped but had been timely pulled up by Wanyan Hong.</p>
 <p>“Let me go! You sicko!” Murong Qing Lian didn’t dare to think about what she encountered the night before.</p>
 <p>This man insulted her the whole night! It was an endless bullying. No matter if it was the front or the back, all was tortured by him till they hovered between life and death. Especially that place; he actually touched there, making her feel very disgusted. She also got to know Wanyan Hong’s sick side.</p>
 <p>“I’m a sicko? Didn’t you enjoy it before very much?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong fiercely pinched Murong Qing Lian’s waist and looked ferociously at her. This woman dared to kick his lifeblood (genitals), truly daring. Fortunately, he protected it in time, otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to use it anymore. Truly a vicious woman! However, she’s truly to his taste.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qing Lian struggling and wanted to beat him, Wanyan Hong grabbed her fist. He smiled, “Miss Murong, perhaps in your body there’s already this crown prince’s blood and flesh. Could it be that you want to let Bei Zhou’s imperial blood wander in the commoner world?”</p>
 <p>“No! Even if I die, I won’t marry you!” Murong Qing Lian couldn’t accept what happened last night. Especially, she didn’t even think about marrying Wanyan Hong.</p>
 <p>“Very well, then go die!” Wanyan Hong suddenly let go and pushed Murong Qing Lian to the ground. He also threw a dagger at her, “You want to die, this crown prince will let your wish come true! Be clean and neat, don’t be half dead and then need to rely on this crown prince to finish the deed!”</p>
 <p>Originally, it was Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi who came to pay their gratitude in the palace. No one expected that in the end, Murong Qing Lian and Wanyan Hong would appear and made such a dramatic scene.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough!” Seeing his son being more and more outrageous, Wanyan Lie coughed twice. “In the end, what had happened? Hong <em>er</em>[5. Er: term of endearment], did you really do things you need to be sorry for towards miss Murong?”</p>
 <p>“Emperor father, we’re each other’s sunshine! This subject son fell in love miss Murong at first sight. This day, after I confessed to miss Murong, she accepted this subject son. Then there was that thing that happened later…Emperor father, this subject son truly loves miss Murong. Asking emperor father to decree marriage on us!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian didn’t want to marry Wanyan Hong. Her true one is Longze Jing Tian, not Wanyan Hong!</p>
 <p>“You don’t want? Then who’ll want you?” Wanyan Hong lowered his body while smiling. He glared into Murong Qing Lian’s eyes which was full of fear, “If you don’t marry this crown prince, could it be, you want to marry another with this broken flower and withered willow body? Would there be someone who would want you?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Hong’s voice was very low, so low only Murong Qing Lian could hear. His words were like a dagger, piercing in Murong Qing Lian’s heart. That was right, she was no longer a virgin anymore. Besides, today so many people saw. It was impossible for Longze Jing Tian to still want her! She wouldn’t be able to become Jing <em>wangfei</em> anymore!</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian’s face became dead gray. Why was it like this?&nbsp; She obviously still had a future yesterday, why did it become like this today?</p>
 <p>“Be good! don’t be angry anymore!” Wanyan Hong pulled Murong Qing Lian up. He carefully arranged her clothes. “This crown prince would be kind to you!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qing Lian didn’t speak, she only cried silently. Her performance, became ‘acquiescence’ in the eyes of other.</p>
 <p>Humph! What a character, ah?! Just now, she courted death, but now she didn’t even have the courage to die. What not wanting to be a <em>cefei</em>? This was obviously loosening the reins only to grasp them better! Lin Ke Xin drank tea and continued to watch the play. This matter was provoked by the crown prince. The crown prince is her son’s rival. So, if she didn’t watch the play now, till when should she wait?</p>
 <p>On the scene, the one with the worst expression was none other than Yu Shi Shi. Just now, Feng Cang and Murong Qi Qi irritated her. Now, her man and Murong Qi Qi came to irritate her!</p>
 <p>It was not that Yu Shi Shi didn’t understand the bruises on Murong Qing Lian’s body, in fact, she understood too well. It seemed that this woman endured a non-human torture, just as she also had in the past. However, she didn’t understand how Wanyan Hong and Murong Qing Lian got together.</p>
 <p>Now, Wanyan Hong wanted to give Murong Qing Lian status. Besides, it was the second only to her <em>cefei</em>. This made Yu Shi Shi feel that she got a rival.</p>
 <p>Although this man wasn’t the one she wanted, but the power and status this man gave her were things she was obsessed with! If there was no Wanyan Hong then she was nothing. Now, Murong Qing Lian put a foot inside it, the loss Yu Shi Shi suffered at Feng Cang’s was aroused.</p>
 <p>“Your highness, marriage is a command from the parents and the matchmaker. Miss Murong’s parents are not here and she isn’t our Bei Zhou’s citizen. I fear we should ask prime minister Murong for his opinion on this marriage,” Yu Shi Shi gently opened her mouth. Hearing her speak, Wanyan Hong was only humphed coldly once, “This doesn’t matter. Isn’t Xi Qi’s Jing <em>wang </em>here? As long as he agrees, it would be fine!”</p>
 <p>Just as Wanyan Hong mentioned Longze Jing tian, a eunuch trotted in and went to Jing De. He whispered in Jing De’s ears. Jing De nodded and came to Wanyan Lie, “Emperor, Xi Qi’s Jing <em>wang</em> Longze Jing Tian seek attendance! The prime minister’s wife Li Qiu Shui also came!”</p>
 <p>“Announce them!”</p>
 <p>From far away, a man and a woman walked over. The man was Longze Jing Tian and the woman was Li Qiu Shui. The moment, Murong Qing Lian heard Longze Jing Tian came, she broke away from Wanyan Hong’s arms. She looked pitifully at Longze Jing Tian and wanted him to save her.</p>
 <p>That Longze Jing Tian appeared was not a surprise. What surprised Murong Qi Qi was Li Qiu Shui. Wasn’t she in Xi Qi? Why did she come here? A bad premonition hit Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>As if he sensed Murong Qi Qi’s unusualness, Feng Cang softly asked, “Qing Qing, what’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>“Nothing.” Murong Qi Qi slowly shook her head, but her eyes had been on Li Qiu Shui.</p>
 <p>Aside from Murong Qi Qi, the one who was surprised at Li Qiu Shui’s appearance was Wanyan Lie, “It’s you…”</p>
