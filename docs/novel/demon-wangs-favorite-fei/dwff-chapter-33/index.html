 <p>Chapter 33 Lake tour</p>
 <p>Don’t know who spread out <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi’s</span> ‘A glance at the mundane world’. Now in the entire capital, no matter where you go, you will hear people hum: “I’m crying today but I’ll laugh tomorrow. This is hard to explain and you don’t know why I’m so proud……”</p>
 <p>When they got to know that this song was sung by the primce minister's&nbsp;rubbish third miss, the whole capital was stunned. Plus, those rumors that Su Mei released before, everyone thought it’s the truth!</p>
 <p>It turned out that the evillest people are prime minister's second miss and Jing <em>wang </em>[1. Wang/wangye: prince of the first rank] Longze Jing Tian! These two has long has a dark commitment and affair. It turned out that the most wronged person is <span style="color: #993300;">third miss Murong</span>!</p>
 <p>Smarter people deduced many things from one case. Just thinking back at the rumors about Murong Qi Qi when she just returned to the capital, moving the brains a little, they guessed that it’s second miss who let them out to deliberately ruin third miss’s reputation! For a time, the citizens of the whole capital stood at <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi’s </span>side without second thought.</p>
 <p>“Is this song really made by <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span>?”</p>
 <p>When Longze Jing Tian heard people play ‘A glance at the mundane world’, he was surprised. Such a song, such a state of mind, is actually made by the <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> he abandoned? What kind of person is she? Why does he suddenly have some regret? Regretting to so easily gave her freedom……</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s expression fell into Murong Xin Lian’s eyes making her heart become grimmer. This Murong Qi Qi still hasn’t dispersed!</p>
 <p>Don’t need to guess the happening of the outside. It must’ve surely been done by her (MQQ)! What should she (MXL) do? If <em>wangye </em>gets interested in <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span>, by then will her position not be affected? Although she wants to kill <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi,</span> but Murong Xin Lian still hasn’t recovered from using her inner energy that time. Using martial arts, won’t be able to do it…...However Murong Xin Lian grew up playing schemes. Just slightly moving her brains, she thought of a way to deal with<span style="color: #993300;"> Murong Qi Qi.</span></p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>this song is really made by <span style="color: #993300;">third </span><span style="color: #993300;">little sister</span>.”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lain still maintained her loving and gentle appearance.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, chenqie </em>[2. Chenqie: subject's wife/ I, used by the female of the imperial family when talking to someone from the imperial family] really wants to invite two little sisters to tour on the lake. Before, our sister’s relationship was very good. Now we are suddenly separated, I somewhat miss them.”</p>
 <p>“Do as you like!”</p>
 <p>With Longze Jing Tian’s words, Murong Xin Lian sent out invitation to the four great families’ misses and young masters. Not only that, Murong Xin Lian also invited princess Ping Yang, Longze Yu Er. This time she must let<span style="color: #993300;"> Murong Qi Qi</span> lost face, utterly lost face!</p>
 <p>“Miss, are you really going?”</p>
 <p>Su Yue read the content of the invitation to <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi.</span></p>
 <p>“Of course!”</p>
 <p><span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> picked up pieces of a white dress.</p>
 <p>“Second big sister personally wrote the invitation, if I don’t go won’t it be like not giving her face?!”</p>
 <p>When <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> arrived at the east lake with Su Yue, almost all the other people have arrived. After going on board, <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi </span>met some acquaintances. She nodded at Li Yun Qing, Shangguan Wu Ji and Bai Mu Fei. <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> sat down on a ventilated place</p>
 <p>As Jing <em>wang’s cefei, </em>[3. Cefei/ce wangfei: second ranked wife of the wangye] Murong Xin Lian is dressed very grandiosely. She is Longze Jing Tian’s first consort. Even if it’s only a <em>cefei, </em>but the other princes are still young and hasn’t married. Moreover, Jing <em>wangfu </em>[4. Wangfu: resdience of a wangye] doesn’t have a <em>wangfei</em>[5. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye], so Murong Xin Lian’s status can be considered very high. Now she completely looks like the hostess and made the arrangements.</p>
 <p>On the boat the men sat at a side drinking wine. The women sat at the other side.</p>
 <p>“Is miss Bai’s hairpin made by Guang Hua <em>gongzi</em>[6. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer a famous unmarried man]? How beautiful!”</p>
 <p>When Duanmu Yi Yi saw the lifelike begonia flower, the envy in her eyes became apparent.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, it’s like how <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> predicted. Bai Yi Yue really suits such begonia flower.</p>
 <p>“Really beautiful!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi smiled at Bai Yi Yue. It’s seems that her taste is very good.</p>
 <p>“Ah, you also know it’s beautiful?”</p>
 <p>The moment Duanmu Yi Yi saw <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> she thought back about that night her tendons were cut. The eyes looking at <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> are becoming more hostile.</p>
 <p>“I thought you don’t understand anything and is an idiot!”</p>
 <p>‘Pa……’</p>
 <p>Su Yue behind <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> rushed forward. She raised her hand and gave Duanmu Yi Yi a resounding slap on the face. The boat turned quiet. Everyone looked at <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi’s</span> side.</p>
 <p>“You, you dare to hit me?!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Yi Yi turned frantic. One hand is covering her cheek, the other is pointing at <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> and Su Yue. Her finger is trembling.</p>
 <p>“The one I hit is you,” Su Yue humphed. “My family’s miss is personally bestowed the title of <span style="color: #993300;">princess Zhao Yang</span> by the emperor, is Bei Zhou country’s <span style="color: #993300;">Nan Lin <em>wangfei. </em></span>If you still dare to speak so presumptuous then it won’t be as simple as just slapping, you!”</p>
 <p>People couldn’t pick thorns from <span style="color: #0000ff;">Su Yue’</span>s words. When Duanmu Yi Yi is mocking <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span>, her voice was very loud. Everyone on the boat heard it. If <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> really pursue the matter, then the one who will have to take the consequences will be Duanmu Yi Yi.</p>
 <p>But being taught by such a <span style="color: #0000ff;">girl,</span> no matter what, Duanmu Yi Yi can’t swallow this anger. She withdrew her sword and wanted to fight, but her ears heard<span style="color: #993300;"> Murong Qi Qi</span> cold and leisurely voice: “Can it be that miss Duanmu is feeling hot and want to go into the lake for a bath?”</p>
 <p>Don’t know why, but this voice made Duanmu Yi Yi shiver. The weather is obviously very hot, why is she feeling so cold?!</p>
 <p>A storm has been resolved by <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi,</span> made Murong Xin Lian feel a bit cold. She immediately stood up and greeted everyone with a smile. But unexpectedly <span style="color: #339966;">Longze Yu Er</span> at a side opened her mouth gloomily: <span style="color: #993300;">“Princess Zhao Yang</span>’s temper is really big. Your maid even dare to hit the empress’s niece!”</p>
 <p>Her relationship with Duanmu Yi Yi has always been good. Since the moment she knows that Duanmu Yi Yi’s hand has been hurt, she complained for her. Now she saw that <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> is so arrogant; hitting Duanmu Yi Yi in front of her, <span style="color: #339966;">Longze Yu Er</span> totally thinks that <span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> didn’t give her face.</p>
 <p>“Thanks for your praise! <em><span style="color: #993300;">Bengong’</span>s </em>[7. Bengong: this palace/ I, used by the females of the imperial family] people are naturally different!”</p>
 <p><span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> did as if she didn’t hear the anger in <span style="color: #339966;">Longze Yu Er’s</span> words.</p>
 <p>“You…….”</p>
 <p>Even <span style="color: #339966;">Longze Yu Er</span> didn’t expect<span style="color: #993300;"> Murong Qi Qi</span> to have such a thick face.</p>
 <p>“Servants, drag this cheap maid out and give her twenty slaps with the wooden stick,” said <span style="color: #339966;">Longze Yu Er</span> suddenly pointing at Su Yue.</p>
 <p>“The reason?”</p>
 <p><span style="color: #993300;">Murong Qi Qi</span> is still leaning softly on the cushion with one hand propping her chin. She looked pollution free white rabbit and doesn’t seem to be nervous for her maid.</p>
 <p>“<span style="color: #339966;"><em>Bengong </em>i</span>s unhappy seeing her. She hinders <span style="color: #339966;"><em>bengong’s </em></span>eyes, affects <span style="color: #339966;"><em>bengong’s </em></span>mood and made <em><span style="color: #339966;">bengong</span> </em>lose appetite. You say, do these count as reason?”</p>
 <p>After <span style="color: #339966;">Longze Yu Er’s</span> voice fell, a grin appeared on Duanmu Yi Yi’s red and swollen face.</p>
 <p>“Is still <span style="color: #339966;">princess</span> who is the best! Still not coming to drag this cheap maid down?!”</p>
 <p>“Hehe…….”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for the people to move,<span style="color: #993300;"> Murong Qi Qi l</span>aughed.</p>
 <p>“A few days ago, the aunt who came to teach me etiquettes said <em>wangye’s </em>body is not good. If <em>chongxi,</em>[8. Chongxi: arrange a wedding for a very ill young man with the hope that the ’event of great joy’ will drive away his bad luck and hasten his recovery] it’s the best to come in pairs and asked if <em>bengong </em>has a suitable candidate. Today, <span style="color: #993300;"><em>bengong </em></span>saw <span style="color: #339966;">princess Ping Yang</span> and miss Duanmu. I feel one of the two of you are a suitable candidate. Who should I tell w<em>angye </em>to choose? This is really giving me headache…….”</p>
