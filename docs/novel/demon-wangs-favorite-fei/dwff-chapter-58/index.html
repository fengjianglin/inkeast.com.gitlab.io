 <p>Chapter 58 The bad news one after another</p>
 <p>Murong Xue Lian kept shouting revenge. Her eyes are glaring full of hate at Duanmu Qing. Why? Why is the unlucky one her? Why is her child that she tried so hard to protect for six months gone and Duanmu Qing is unscathed?</p>
 <p>“Good! Beloved consort, be assured. <em>Zhen</em>[1.Zhen I, used by an emperor ] will give justice to you and your child!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu’s mood is very terrible. All bad things stacked together. Here he hadn’t appeased Murong Xue Lian yet, when there Duanmu Qing began to cry.</p>
 <p>“Yu Er, my Yu Er. Wake up, ah! Wake up quickly, ah!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Qing held Longze Yu Er’s body and cried loudly.</p>
 <p>“Yu Er, Yu Er…….”</p>
 <p>Just in one hour, he lost two children. Longze Yu couldn’t help but look at Murong Xin Lian angrily. Everything is because of her! If it wasn’t because of her, Longze Yu Er wouldn’t die. Murong Xue Lian also wouldn’t have a miscarriage!</p>
 <p>Sensing the killing intent in Longze Yu’s eyes, Murong Xin Lian climbed to Longze Yu and kowtowed: “Emperor, I’m innocent! I also lost a child. That’s your first grandchild, ah!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xue Lian’s words let Longze Yu’s gaze shift to the long trail of blood behind her. That blood is not red like Murong Xue Lian’s but dark. It seemed that there’s some more to it!</p>
 <p>Longze Yu didn’t believe Murong Xin Lian. Before he didn’t hear anything about an imperial grandson. How come there’s now suddenly an unborn imperial grandson? Immediately Longze Yu let the imperial physician inspect Murong Xin Lian’s body. He wanted to know the truth!</p>
 <p>The imperial physician stroked his beard while checking the pulse for Murong Xin Lian. After a while, he changed to the right hand. After a while again, the imperial physician walked to Longze Yu and knelt down.</p>
 <p>“Emperor, Jing <em>wang cefei</em>[2. Cefei/ce wangfei: second ranked wife of a wangye] took medicine for abortion. That’s why she miscarriage. Besides this drug is strong. C<em>e wangfei </em>hurt her body. I’m afraid that she won’t be able to get pregnant in the future anymore……”</p>
 <p>“Medicine for abortion?”</p>
 <p>Not only Longze Yu, Murong Xin Lian was also in stunned.</p>
 <p>What did she eat? Why is it like this? Murong Xin Lian forgot the pain on her body and tried hard to remember everything that happened after she entered the palace. At the end, she remembered the empress rewarding her dessert and wine!</p>
 <p>“It’s you! It was you, isn’t it?”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian struggled to get on her feet. Her finger trembled when pointing at Duanmu Qing: “I only ate the dessert and wine you rewarded. It’s definitely you! Right? How can you be so heartless? Why……?”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s words incensed Duanmu Qing’s anger. She stood up and slapped Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>“Who do you think you are to dare to speak like this to <em>bengong</em>[3. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family]! <em>Bengong</em> didn’t even pursue the charge of you murdering the princess. You actually dare to frame <em>bengong</em>? Servants, drag this bitch down for <em>bengong</em>!”</p>
 <p>“The empress dowager has arrived…….”</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, a group of people escorted a grey haired old lady in.</p>
 <p>“Empress mother, why did you come over?”</p>
 <p>Seeing Shangguan Fei Yan, Longze Yu immediately went to greet her.</p>
 <p>“<em>Aijia</em>[4. Aijia: I, used by an empress dowager] heard that some things happened and come over to take a look.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the blood on the ground, Shangguan Fei Yan frowned.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“Empress mother, you need to get justice for <em>chenqie</em>[5. Chenqie: I, used by the wives of the emperor while talking to someone of higher rank]!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Qing knelt down in front of Shangguan Fei Yan and cried hysterically.</p>
 <p>“Yu Er died, empress mother!”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Only after hearing this Shangguan Fei Yan saw the lifeless body of Longze Yu Er on the ground. Immediately her expression changed.</p>
 <p>“What happened? Who is so cruel to kill <em>aijia’s </em>Yu Er?”</p>
 <p>“Imperial grandmother, asking you to get justice for granddaughter in law! Asking you to get justice to your great grandchild!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Duanmu Qing being the <em>thief crying thief</em>, Murong Xin Lian also knelt in front of Shangguan Fei Yan. Her whole body was covered in blood. Her face was pale because of the miscarriage. She looked very pitiful.</p>
 <p>After Shangguan Fei Yan understood what has happened, the cane in her hand hit the ground hard.</p>
 <p>“Investigate! Investigate throughout for <em>aijia</em>! Wu Ji, you take charge!”</p>
 <p>The empress dowager personally commanded Shangguan Wu Ji to take charge of the investigation. Duanmu Qing didn’t say anything. The four great families; she came from Duanmu family, behind Murong Xue Lian there’s Li family. As for Bai family, they have always just only been merchants. Shangguan Wu Ji is then the most suitable candidate.</p>
 <p>Just in a moment, Shangguan Wu Ji already found the palace maid who send the dessert and wine to Murong Xin Lian, but she had already been silenced. The whole atmosphere became more heavy because of the palace maid’s death.</p>
 <p>The person Duanmu Qing sent to send the dessert and wine to Murong Xin Lian is dead. People couldn’t help but suspect Duanmu Qing.</p>
 <p>“Empress, what’s going on?”</p>
 <p>Although Shangguan Fei Yan is over fifty years, but her prestige is still there.</p>
 <p>“Empress mother<em>, chenqie</em> doesn’t know. Someone must’ve definitely framed <em>chenqie</em>.”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Qing also didn’t expect that the outcome will be like this, but she really didn’t do anything, ah!</p>
 <p>“It’s definitely you!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian began to cry.</p>
 <p>Just the thought that because of Duanmu Qing, she won’t be able to get pregnant ever again, Murong Xin Lian was full of hate till her teeth clattered. Even if Longze Jing Tian dotes on her very much, but not being able to have children, she won’t have a thing to fall back on. Moreover, the disgust that Longze Jing Tian has for her is so obvious. In the future, she won’t have good days anymore on Jing <em>wangfu</em>[6. Wangfu: residence of a wangye]</p>
 <p>“You don’t have children, so you’re jealous that I’ve become pregnant. That’s why you can’t tolerate him!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s lips trembled and she was very emotional.</p>
 <p>“Just now I saw with my own eyes how princess hurt imperial noble consort<em>niangniang</em>[7. Niangniang:used by someone of lower rank to refer to the females of the imperial family] which led to her miscarriage. Now you harmed me so I lost the child. It must be because you can’t see our Murong household&nbsp;be well. That’s why you used underhanded means to kill! It’s definitely like this!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for people to understand, Murong Xin Lian rushed to Duanmu Qing. She grabbed Duanmu Qing. She rolled with Duanmu Qing on the ground and twisted into a ball.</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous! It’s obviously you who killed my Yu Er! You’re just too vicious!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Qing also didn’t show weakness, grabbed Murong Xin Lian’s hairs and teared at it.</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous! Really presumptuous!”</p>
 <p>An empress and a <em>wangfei</em>[8. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye] are now like abandoned wives shouting on the streets. Really shameful! Longze Yu’s face became red from anger.</p>
 <p>“Separate them! Separate!”</p>
 <p>Don’t know if it was Duanmu Qing who was unlucky or what, when the two were separated, Duanmu Qing stepped on Murong Xin Lian’s gown. Along with the two palace maids, the four fell down. Duanmu Qing was the unluckiest. She was pressed down by three people above her.</p>
 <p>“Aiya……”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s knee just happened to touch Duanmu Qing’s belly. The next moment, Duanmu Qing felt pain in her belly. Immediately two hands covered her belly, but it was too late. A warm liquid streamed out along her thigh.</p>
 <p>“My child. My child!”</p>
 <p>Seeing such a scene, Duanmu Qing was in daze.</p>
 <p>“Imperial physician, imperial physician! Come quickly. Save my child!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Qing being pregnant surprised the crowd. Originally she wanted to stabilize the foetus before telling Longze Yu, but such an accident happened in the middle.</p>
 <p>“<em>Niangniang,</em> don’t grief too much……”</p>
 <p>After the imperial physician checked the pulse for Duanmu Qing, he shook his head. Just a few words broke Duanmu Qing’s last hope.</p>
 <p>“No! My son, ah……”</p>
 <p>The child she hoped to get for so many years was gone in just a moment. Duanmu Qing couldn’t accept this fact. She shook her head and screamed: “No……”</p>
