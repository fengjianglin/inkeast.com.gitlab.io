 <p><em>TL Note: Bonus chapter to celebrate my birthday ^_^</em></p>
 <p>Chapter 70 Snake beauty’s heart (2)</p>
 <p>Inside Jingxin palace, as Lin Ke Xin was thinking about how to bribe Feng Cang and let him become under her son’s command, Murong Qi Qi was brought&nbsp;to the Sun and Moon lake in the palace by Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>“How is it? Here is much more beautiful than Xi Qi, don’t you think?!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu raised her chin like a proud peacock and still refused to look at Murong Qi Qi with <em>direct eyes</em>.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Doesn’t look with direct eyes means that WBZ sees MQQ as someone below her. </em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“En.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi put on a blank face. She nodded but didn’t say yes nor no.</p>
 <p>Although it’s already winter, the snow hadn't come yet. The lake was unusually deserted. It emitted a burst of coldness. Murong Qi Qi didn’t know why Wanyan Bao Zhu brought her here, but looking at the expressions of those other women, she knew it was not something good. That’s why she had long prepared to catch her (WBZ) next move.</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi’s wooden eyes, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t understand why Feng Cang liked&nbsp;Murong Qi Qi. Not only did she not&nbsp;understand, even Mu Yu Die and Yu Shi Shi couldn’t understand why Feng Cang’s taste was so ‘unique’.</p>
 <p>However, the one who first opened her mouth to make things difficult for Murong Qi Qi was not Wanyan Bao Zhu, but crown princess Yu Shi Shi.</p>
 <p>“Xi Qi’s landscape must be very good. That’s why it could raise such a delicate person as princess. Even <em>wangye</em>[1. Wangye/ wang: prince of first rank] treats you differently. It’s just, there’s a sentence <em>bengong</em>[2. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family] doesn’t know if <em>bengong </em>should say it or not……”</p>
 <p>You already opened your mouth, will I still be able to not let you fart? Murong Qi Qi was thinking&nbsp; in her heart, but on her face, she put up a respectful smile: “Please enlighten me, crown princess <em>niangniang</em>[3. Niangniang: used to refer the females of the imperial family by someone of lower rank]."</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye </em>is excellent in both literature and military. He is the famous hero of Bei Zhou; but princess, it seems like you know nothing. If this is spread around, people will feel injustice for <em>wangye. </em>Although women without talent are virtuous, but she still needs to know the basics. Otherwise, when men encounter new people, it’ll be very easy to forget the old one.”</p>
 <p>So, it turned out that she was talking about this? Murong Qi Qi sneered in her heart, but her face showed an even more respectful smile: “Crown princess <em>niangniang</em> is right. It’s just that <em>bengong </em>likes embroidery and management of the household more. <em>Bengong </em>feels that putting oneself in someone else’s shoes, in the end will get the other party’s true heart. No matter how <em>wangye </em>treats me in the future, <em>bengong </em>will surely treat him wholeheartedly and will certainly not live in the <em>wangfu</em>[4. Wangfu: residence of the prince of first rank]&nbsp;while the heart is elsewhere; using one heart for two purposes……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words were like a strike, fiercely slapping Yu Shi Shi’s face. Immediately, Yu Shi Shi’s expression turned bad……</p>
 <p>What does she mean? What does she mean by using one heart for two purposes? What does she know? Or has she heard something? Why does she know her inner thoughts……?</p>
 <p>Yu Shi Shi’s face turned pale then turned red. She stood there. It wouldn’t be right if she answers that; it wouldn’t be right if she stood there without saying anything. She could only laugh embarrassingly.</p>
 <p>The girls present also heard some of the rumors about Yu Shi Shi and Feng Cang. Although it’s not confirmed, but after seeing Yu Shi Shi’s performance at the banquet; no one was blind. That’s why when Murong Qi Qi said that, those girls covered their mouths and laughed.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu laughed till she was trembling. She had long known that Yu Shi Shi was a ‘cunning plot’. It’s just that because of her identity, she couldn’t say anything. Now that Murong Qi Qi embarrassed Yu Shi Shi, Wanyan Bao Zhu was naturally happy.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that Yu Shi Shi and Feng Cang once had an engagement. However, before the marriage, Yu Shi Shi backed off and married crown prince Wanyan Hong. Binding herself to such a big tree as the crown prince, in one single step, she became the crown princess.</p>
 <p>Ever since Yu Shi Shi backed off from the marriage, Feng Cang had gotten bad luck. For eight, consecutive years, after the first day of marriage, the next day would be the day of mourning. The position of Nan Lin <em>wangfei</em>[wangfei: main wife/ consort of the prince of first rank] also seemed cursed, making it that, although these women adored Feng Cang, but they were stopped by the position of <em>wangfei</em>.</p>
 <p>Many people attributed Feng Cang’s ‘tragic fate’ to Yu Shi Shi. Because she backed off, she broke Feng Cang’s fate, which resulted in that none of Feng Cang's marriages were ever fulfilled. That’s why, every time there's a court meeting, no one would bother with this crown princess. In the whole upper class, her relationship with women was simply bad to the extreme.</p>
 <p>A country’s crown princess got humiliated by another country’s princess and it was witnessed by so many people. The more Yu Shi Shi thought about it, the angrier she got.</p>
 <p>But she is a crown princess, the future empress. She needs to remain virtuous and be big-hearted. So she acted like nothing had happened. It’s just that in her heart, she hated Murong Qi Qi to death. She felt that Murong Qi Qi shouldn’t expose her in public and let her become everyone’s joke!</p>
 <p>Although crown princess suffered defeat and many people were laughing at her, but there were also people who helped her. The one who opened her mouth next was Mu Yu Die. She was also an old woman who waited for Feng Cang till twenty years. This woman seemed quiet and gentle, but the words coming out of her mouth were filled with thorns.</p>
 <p>“Princess being so virtuous is <em>wangye’s </em>blessing. No wonder <em>wangye </em>is infatuated with you and there’s no one else in his eyes. Especially that sentence of just now, ‘Ruo river is three thousand li, one only drinks one ladle worth of water from it’ really made the people who listened to it envious!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die coming to her rescue, crown princess couldn’t help but look at her gratefully. And Mu Yu Die’s words made the women who had just laughed at Yu Shi Shi turn to Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu laughed most brilliantly just now. Now, her expression also changed the fastest. Just now, it was the spring of March. Now, it’s the cold winter of December.</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die didn’t feel enough with just talking. She walked to Murong Qi Qi and carefully looked at the light green cloak on Murong Qi Qi. This cloak had long before grabbed Mu Yu Die’s attention. This time, after looking at it closely, in Mu Yu Die’s eyes, there was not only surprise but also envy, jealousy and hate.</p>
 <p>“This cloak is so fine. It must be certainly from a master’s hands!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s cloak was light green. On it were four four-leaf clovers embroidered with light golden threads. This four-leaf clover was a new thing. No one had seen it before. That’s why everyone was surprised and the embroidery also made people praise it. The person wearing the cloak only needed to move a little bit and she would be glittering like the sun.</p>
 <p>“This is a new cloak from Jue Se Fang. <em>Wangye </em>ordered it early on.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words were to the point. Everyone understood the value of this cloak.</p>
 <p>Jue Se Fang and Tong Bao Zhai were the most favorite places of the women of this world. Although Tong Bao Zhai already has&nbsp;a branch in Bei Zhou country, but Jue Se Fang&nbsp;did not. This meant that Feng Cang prepared this cloak when they were in Xi Qi.</p>
 <p>“What is this&nbsp;type of leaves called? I’ve never seen it before!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die pointed at the four-leaf clover on Murong Qi Qi’s cloak.</p>
 <p>“Oh, this is a four-leaf clover and they are also called lucky clovers. From ten thousand three-leaf clovers, there’s only one four-leaf clover. Legend has it that the person who can find a four-leaf clover will always be happy.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s voice was like gurgling spring water; sweet and moving. After hearing her explanation, they had a new understanding of four-leaf clovers and felt that these four-leaf clovers are a special plant.</p>
 <p>“Where did princess hear this from?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die claimed to be the most talented woman. In this group, she was the most talented. That’s why she wouldn’t accept Murong Qi Qi’s words so easily.</p>
 <p>“It’s the shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang who told <em>wangye. </em>Then <em>wangye </em>told me.”</p>
 <p>Mentioning Feng Cang, Murong Qi Qi’s smiling face blushed. Her eyes were filled with happiness, making Mu Yu Die who saw it feel like a knife is cutting into her heart. However, it seemed like Murong Qi Qi did it intentionally. From time to time, her eyes swept over Mu Yu Die. This made Mu Yu Die’s heart feel even more uncomfortable, but there’s nothing she could do.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em> is really good to princess!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die smiled awkwardly. She took a deep breath in her heart and also comforted herself. She (MQQ) is nothing but a slut. She should not lower herself to her (MQQ) level! She should not spur into action by her (MQQ) remarks!</p>
 <p>“En,” Murong Qi Qi continued to nod and act like a shy girl, making Mu Yu Die, who was self-regulating, angry till she gritted her teeth. Mu Yu Die’s forced expression made Murong Qi Qi very happy.</p>
 <p>She is but an old woman and she still dares to want things? Does it even matter if you had anything to do with Feng Cang before? What does your high status matter? What does your talent matter? Now, there’s her (MQQ). She has to take care of all these small mosquitoes and flies! Not to mention such an old woman!</p>
 <p><span style="color: #993366;"><em>(Emituofo, don’t attack at the case of the woman’s old age. In that era, 20 years old is already an old lady)---from the author</em></span></p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi viciously classified twenty years old Mu Yu Die as ‘old woman’. If Mu Yu Die knew that in Murong Qi Qi’s heart, she, who was as beautiful as a flower, was nothing more than an old woman, she would definitely cough blood from anger……</p>
 <p>“I heard the shopkeeper of Jue Se Fang say that they will open a few stores in Bei Zhou by&nbsp;the end of the year. By that time, there will be many of these beautiful cloaks.”</p>
 <p>At this time, Murong Qi Qi did&nbsp;not forget to advertise for her Jue Se Fang.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, after hearing that Jue Se Fang will open stores in Bei Zhou, these women became excited.</p>
 <p>“Do you know when?”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu grabbed Murong Qi Qi’s hand in excitement.</p>
 <p>“Princess, you hurt me!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi frowned. Wanyan Bao Zhu pouted. In her heart, she felt that Murong Qi Qi was too fragile and weak. She looked down on her even more.</p>
 <p>After Wanyan Bao Zhu let her go, Murong Qi Qi smiled softly: “I also don’t know the specific date. I just heard that it’s at the end of this year. It’ll catch up with the new year.”</p>
 <p>Say a vague time to let everybody long for it. Everyone here today are ladies and young masters of noble families. Let them spread it out, before long Jue Se Fang’s fame will spread greatly in Bei Zhou. When they finally open, she will then earn many gold and silver.</p>
 <p>For a time, the ladies were immersed in the fantasy of Jue Se Fang.</p>
 <p>Before, when Tong Bao Zhai opened in Bei Zhou, it was very lively. Because there were too many people, shopkeeper Fang Kui couldn’t help but use the auction way to sell the jewelries. The result was that all the jewelries were&nbsp;quickly gone and the revenue was much higher than expected.</p>
 <p>Those jewelries, not to mention the exquisite materials used, only the wonderful designs made&nbsp;people love it too much to part with it. They loved them so much that they weren’t willing to put them down.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, on that day of the auction, one set had been&nbsp;bought by Feng Cang. It’s the ‘Autumn flower’ that Murong Qi Qi wore before. The set ‘Clear moon’ was&nbsp;bought by Wanyan Lie. He gave it to noble consort Yue Lan Zhi.</p>
 <p>‘Autumn flower’. The moment she thought about ‘Autumn flower’, Wanyan Bao Zhu’s heart would have&nbsp;a knot.</p>
 <p>She had just taken a fancy to that jewelry and didn’t even have time to shout a price, when it was bought directly by Feng Cang’s subordinates at a high price. Later on, he gave it to Murong Qi Qi and let her shine at the banquet in Xi Qi. Really, such a good jewelry was wasted!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Wanyan Bao Zhu asked Murong Qi Qi directly: “Why didn’t you wear ‘Autumn flower’ today?”</p>
 <p>The moment she asked that did the others know that the set of jewelry was at Murong Qi Qi’s. Immediately, their eyes, as they looked at her, turned into ‘envy, jealousy and hate’. Tong Bao Zhai’s jewelries was famous throughout the world and priceless. What does she, Murong Qi Qi, has to be able to wear ‘Autumn flower’ that was personally designed by Guang Hua <em>gongzi</em>[5. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer a famous man]?</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye </em>said that Autumn flower is too heavy. Wearing it too long is not good for the neck.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi pushed everything on Feng Cang. Anyway, no one would dare to go verify with Feng Cang. No matter what she said, it wouldn’t matter.</p>
 <p>The look of Murong Qi Qi today was&nbsp;very fresh. Every jewelry was made by grinding <em>furong</em> stone (crystal); compact yet elegant. It’s just that no one knew this <em>furong </em>stone. So, they didn’t see it as a rarity and it also didn’t get the women’s interest.</p>
 <p>[caption id="attachment_14720" align="aligncenter" width="217"]<img class="wp-image-14720 size-full" src="http://volarenovels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/furong-stone.jpg" width="217" height="233"> white furong stone[/caption]</p>
 <p>If they had the foresight and knew that Tong Bao Zhou would soon launch a series of outstanding beautiful jewelries which all were made with the not eye-catching <em>furong </em>stone, they would most certainly take down all of Murong Qi Qi’s jewelries for themselves.</p>
 <p>Although Murong Qi Qi’s looks were ordinary, and so was&nbsp;her ability, but she was still a princess that Xi Qi had sent for a marriage alliance. Moreover, she kept saying <em>wangye</em> this and <em>wangye </em>that, making the people gain&nbsp;some good feelings for Feng Cang. The women who had fantasies about the position of Nan Lin <em>wangfei</em> looked at her with even more resentment.</p>
 <p>When all of those looks full of resentment fell on Murong Qi Qi, she remembered them all one by one. It’s just that why hasn’t anyone made a move yet? They already came to such a remote place. Presumably, there would be some women who won't&nbsp;be able to hold it in any&nbsp;longer!</p>
 <p>After walking some more, a stone arch bridge appeared before them. Wanyan Bao Zhu and Mu Yu Die glanced at each other. After exchanging thoughts, Wanyan Bao Zhu was the first one to stand on the stone bridge.</p>
 <p>“Koi, in this season, there’s actually koi! Ning <em>er</em>[6. Er: term of endearment], bring the fish food! Yong <em>er</em>, bring the net! <em>Bengong </em>wants to personally catch a few koi to hold a fish feast for giving princess Zhao Yang good luck!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu ordered everything. Mu Yu Die also helped. Before, when the two were against each other because of Feng Cang, they were rivals. Now, in order to deal with Murong Qi Qi, they became comrades.</p>
 <p>Yu Shi Shi seemed to not have seen anything. She let people put a heater and blankets in the pavilion. She also let people prepare tea and snacks. Others seemed to have a tacit, mutual understanding and helped Wanyan Bao Zhu. It’s as if they were waiting to see a good show of Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, can <em>bengong </em>call you that? Come take a look. Now, there still are koi. It’s really strange! It’s certainly because they knew you were coming and came here to welcome you!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu pointed at the lake and gestured for Murong Qi Qi to come over.</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu’s ‘Qi Qi’, made Murong Qi Qi feel somewhat ‘flattered’. After hearing that there were fish seen in a&nbsp;winter season, Murong Qi Qi immediately became ‘exhilarated’ and went on the stone bridge.</p>
 <p>“Where? Where are they?”</p>
 <p>“Here! Princess, come quickly and take a look!”</p>
 <p>Knowing that Wanyan Bao Zhu wanted to mess with Murong Qi Qi, the others quickly gave way to let Murong Qi Qi come on the bridge.</p>
 <p>“Where?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi looked curiously, while she sneered in her heart. Where was there fish in this lake? There weren’t even fish scales! They led her here, could it be that they want to throw her into the lake?</p>
 <p>“Princess, the fish food came!”</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, Ning <em>er </em>came, holding a box with fish food. That so-called fish food turned out to be whirring and meaty worms.</p>
 <p>However, it seemed that these women were already accustomed and didn’t feel a bit afraid. Instead, they looked smilingly at Murong Qi Qi as if they were waiting for her ending.</p>
 <p>“Wo, worms…….” Murong Qi Qi covered her mouth. Seeing those worms, she almost vomited and her expression was very afraid, making those women prouder of themselves. Usually, they use worms to fish and were no longer surprised by them anymore. They didn’t think that Murong Qi Qi would be so afraid of worms. What a joke!</p>
 <p>Don’t know if Ning <em>er</em> did it intentionally or what, when she almost reached Murong Qi Qi, she slipped. The box of fish food flew directly towards Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“Ah! No…….”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi looked very distressed as if seeing those oncoming worms was very scary. Her feet also began to slip. She just took a step back when someone put her feet behind her and wanted to make her trip. If she really fell from this stone bridge, even if she didn’t sprain her legs, she’d still get a cerebral concussion. If the direction was a bit off, then she would go directly into the water!</p>
 <p>Humph! Really good calculation! Murong Qi Qi, without a trace of politeness, stepped on the other party’s foot. After a ‘kacha’ sound, Mu Yu Die’s scream could be heard. And Murong Qi Qi conveniently fell in the opposite direction, just in time to open a way. All those worms flew toward Wanyan Ba Zhu and Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>It happened that while the worms were flying towards them, Mu Yu Die’s mouth was open, which caused her to swallow five or six worms.</p>
 <p>“Ou…….”</p>
 <p>At this time, Mu Yu Die has forgotten about the pain on her foot. She immediately went to a side of the stone bridge and began vomiting. And when she turned, just at the right time she happened to bump into Wanyan Bao Zhu.</p>
 <p>Not waiting for the people to understand, Wanyan Bao Zhu was&nbsp;bumped into the lake by Mu Yu Die.</p>
 <p>“Ah! Princess, princess! Servants! Quickly come! Princess has fallen into the lake!”</p>
 <p>Ning <em>er</em> was the first one to react. She quickly began to shout.</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Yu Die saw that she had bumped into the princess, making her fall into the lake, she was so afraid that she forgot to vomit. She also forgot about the worms she had swallowed and even ignored the pain on her foot.&nbsp; She immediately reached out, wanting to pull Wanyan Bao Zhu up: “Princess, grab my hand! Grab my hand!”</p>
 <p>The moment Mu Yu Die shouted, everyone became anxious. Falling into the water in this weather, not to mention the fact that Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t swim, even if she could swim, she would’ve been frozen terribly.</p>
 <p>“Save me! I don’t know how to swim! Save me!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu splashed&nbsp;about in the cold lake water. The bone-piercing cold made her whole body hurt.</p>
 <p>When she saw Mu Yu Die reach over, Wanyan Bao Zhu did her best to extend&nbsp;her hands, wanting to grab onto Mu Yu Die’s hands. However, she didn’t expect that just when she almost grabbed the hands, she would lose strength and fall back. A&nbsp;few mouthfuls of cold water repeatedly went into her stomach.</p>
 <p>Damn! She certainly did it intentionally!</p>
 <p>The moment the thought of Mu Yu Die bumping her into the water hit her, Wanyan Bao Zhu felt&nbsp;immense hatred for the Mu Yu Die who kept shouting ‘princess, grab my hand’. For who is she acting? It’s obviously you who made me fall into the lake, now you are acting like that. Really didn’t think that you are the most underhanded person!</p>
 <p>When Mu Yu Die once again reached out her hand, Wanyan Bao Zhu took a deep breath and in a momentum, strove to grab Mu Yu Die’s hand.</p>
 <p>“I caught the princess! Come help quickly!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die was very happy. She reached out her other hand to pull Wanyan Bao Zhu, but unexpectedly when everyone came over, they touched her injured foot. At that point, Mu Yu Die's foot felt immense pain. So painful that her face changed color. She couldn’t help but relinquish her grip.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Mu Yu Die still wanted to ‘play’ with her, Wanyan Bao Zhu couldn’t take it anymore. She tightly grasped Mu Yu Die's hand and then pulled her into the lake with her.</p>
 <p>“Let you trick me!”</p>
 <p>Wanyan Bao Zhu fell into the lake before Mu Yu Die. Now, she had almost adapted to the coldness of the water. Only Mu Yu Die, who had just fallen in, became numb because of the cold water. Taking advantage that Mu Yu Die was still adapting, Wanyan Bao Zhu put her arms around Mu Yu Die’s neck, pressing Mu Yu Die in the water.</p>
 <p>“Let you trick me, bitch! Dare to trick <em>bengong</em>!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yu Die didn't understood the situation yet, as she had already been pressed into the water by Wanyan Bao Zhu and drank a few mouthfuls of water. When she came to understand that the other party was ‘repaying kindness with hatred’, Mu Yu Die also got angry. She grabbed Wanyan Bao Zhu’s hair and began to fight with her in the water.</p>
 <p>At this point, the scene became more chaotic. And Murong Qi Qi, who nearly fell&nbsp;onto the ground after&nbsp;being pushed off the stone bridge by people, was&nbsp;saved by someone. It’s a man? Just as she sniffed the ambergris fragrance on the other party’s body, Murong Qi Qi had already fallen&nbsp;into the arms of the other party.</p>
