 <p>Chapter 27:&nbsp;Princess Zhao Yang</p>
 <p>Although Murong Xin Lian put a lot of effort to persuade herself that this is Murong Qi Qi’s trick, it’s her (MQQ) who is trying to drive a wedge between her (MXL) and Fei Cui, that she is doing it intentionally. But just the thought of Zheng Min’s tragic death and the shame that it brought her, the way Murong Xin Lian looked at Fei Cui became darker.</p>
 <p>“Second miss, this slave really didn’t do anything, really!”</p>
 <p>Sensing Murong Xin Lian’s intention to kill, Fei Cui quickly knelt down and kowtowed.</p>
 <p>“Second miss, I’ve served you for so many years, even if there’s no credit but there’s hard work! Second miss, this slave has never betrayed you!”</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui, what do mean, ah?! Do you mean that our miss slandered you?”</p>
 <p>Su Mei isn’t happy hearing that.</p>
 <p>“Who was it that knelt in front of our miss and said that its second miss who forced you to do that thing that happened that year; it’s second miss who took that glowing pearl and that you were completely forced? Fei Cui, the words you said don’t not admit it.”</p>
 <p>“Enough, Su Mei!”</p>
 <p>Su Yue who has been silent for the whole time finally opened her mouth to help.</p>
 <p>“That year she can betray her master for second miss, now she can also betray second miss for our miss. There’s no need to talk about justification with such person. She is just someone who doesn’t have spine!”</p>
 <p>“Bitch!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s reasoning has disappeared with Su Mei and Su Yue’s talks. She rushed to Fei Cui and kicked her in the chest. Fei Cui’s body immediately flew like a disconnected kite against the wall.</p>
 <p>“Second miss………”</p>
 <p>Blood came from Fei Cui’s mouth. She looked incredibly at Murong Xin Lian. She followed this second miss for five years. She has never thought that her loyalty would pay such an outcome.</p>
 <p>“Second little , what are you doing?!”</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, Murong Jun’s voice came over. The next moment, he appeared in front of Fei Cui.</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui, Fei Cui, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>“Young, young master?””</p>
 <p>The person that appeared in front of her made Fei Cui surprised. Why is young master here? Why is he showing a specially caring expression?</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Fei Cui to thin it through, Murong Jun stood up. He looked full of anger at Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>“Murong Xin Lian, you are too vicious! I’ve already promised Fei Cui to take her as concubine. You actually dare to hurt her!”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Not only Fei Cui, Murong Xin Lian is also stunned.</p>
 <p>Why did Murong Jun take a fancy on Fei Cui? Why did he suddenly take Fei Cui as concubine? Can it be that it’s really like what Murong Qi Qi said; it’s Fei Cui who betrayed her, that’s why Murong Qi Qi and Murong Jun overcame the trap? Right, it must be like that!</p>
 <p>A……. Murong Qi Qi lowered her head but the laughter in her eyes is really strong. She didn’t expect that this big brother knows how <em>to push the boat with the current</em>, nor is he a fool like how the rumors say.</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li>To push the boat with the current: to take advantage of the situation for one’s own benefit</li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Do you think that the thing you did is flawless? Murong Xin Lian, you are so vicious! When father come, I’ll let father judge!”</p>
 <p>Murong Jun took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the blood on Fei Cui’s mouth.</p>
 <p>“Fei Cui, you have suffered! If it wasn’t for you, I’m afraid that now I’ll be……”</p>
 <p>“In short, Fei Cui don’t worry, the thing I promised you, I’ll definitely do!”</p>
 <p>“No, no…….”</p>
 <p>Fei Cui was never so afraid like now. When did young master get together with third miss? They are doing this, isn’t it like wanting her to die?! Fei Cui immediately broke away from Murong Jun’s embrace and retreated in fear at the other side.</p>
 <p>“Miss, I, I didn’t, I really…….”</p>
 <p>Seeing the gloomy Murong Xin Lian come closer and closer, Fei Cui’s eyes showed unprecedented fear. <em>Three men talking makes a tiger, </em>Murong Xin Lian must’ve believed Murong Qi Qi’s words!</p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Three men talking makes a tiger: repeated rumor becomes a fact</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Slut!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian didn’t listen to Fei Cui. A kick again on Fei Cui’s chest. This time, Fei Cui didn’t utter a sound and immediately fainted.</p>
 <p>“You, you killed her!”</p>
 <p>Murong Jun put his finger under Fei Cui’s nose. He felt no breath. Murong Jun was so scared that he sat on the ground. The finger pointing at Murong Xin Lian also began trembling.</p>
 <p>“You killed her!”</p>
 <p>“She is only a cheap maid, what about that I killed her?! If big brother really likes her, I’ll give you this dead body!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian glared once at Murong Jun, making him shiver. He immediately got away from Fei Cui.</p>
 <p>“Ai……”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi seemed like she is unable to bear that Fei Cui fate is like this. She slowly walked to Murong Xin Lian.</p>
 <p>“Second big sister, she and I after all had an owner and slave relationship. Let me bury her!”</p>
 <p>Today she came to calculate with Murong Qi Qi, but in the end the one who was humiliated is herself. Murong Xin Lian really wants to go forward and give Murong Qi Qi a kick like Fei Cui’s. But Murong Jun is here and beside Murong Qi Qi there’s a high skilled martial artist. Murong Xin Lian can only force herself to gulp this anger down. She can take revenge in the future.</p>
 <p>“If you want it, I’ll give it to you!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian said that really coldly.</p>
 <p>“Third little sister really cares about feelings and friendship!”</p>
 <p>“Compared to second big sister, I’m not even close!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi said that modestly. Her face returned to the usual humble and meek expression.</p>
 <p>“Pretend! Keep pretending!”</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian hasn’t finish talking when she heard: “<em>Shengzhi [1. Shengzi: decree by the emperor]</em>&nbsp;has arrived…….”</p>
 <p>At Cui Zhu <em>yuan [2. Yuan: a wing/ a part of a residence],&nbsp;</em>three figures appeared. The one in the front is Jing <em>wang [3. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank]&nbsp;</em>Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye……”</em></p>
 <p>Seeing Longze Jing Tian, Murong Xin Lian’s distorted face immediately became more gentle and full of love. The one who just said that Murong Qi Qi is pretending, now she is pretending, even god will exclaim in admiration.</p>
 <p>Followed behind Longze Jing Tian are Murong Tai and an eunuch.</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi accept the decree!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian coldly swept over Murong Qi Qi with a sullen face. He apparently didn’t let go of what happened this morning and was very reluctant to make this trip.</p>
 <p>“Kneel, kneel quickly, ah!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that his children is just standing there, Murong Tai got anxious. He went forward, pulled them and shouted “ten thousand years” together. They knelt together in front of Lonze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s bunch of flowery words, Murong Qi Qi simply didn’t listen to them. She only knows that after this decree fell, she became from Murong household's<i>&nbsp;</i>third miss to Xi Qi country’s Princess Zhao Yang. In the near future, she will marry to Bei Zhou, marry that Nan Lin <em>wang </em>Feng Cang who people call ‘demon <em>wang</em>’.</p>
 <p>Really overwhelming, ah! Murong Qi Qi stood up and took over the decree. She glanced at the horizon. Princess? Marry for peace? Ah, this surprise really came in time!</p>
 <p>“Congratulations third miss!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian looked at Murong Qi Qi. The way she is looking at the sky is alert. It’s different from the frivolous woman at Duanmu <em>fu </em>this morning. Thinking about the meaning behind this decree and the rumors about that Feng Cang, Longze Jing Tian’s hostility against Murong Qi Qi reduced somewhat. In his heart there’s a hint of sympathy.</p>
 <p>“<em>Bengong [4. Bengong: I, used by the females of the imperial family]&nbsp;</em>is Princess Zhao Yang!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s soul returned to her body. She retrieved her gaze. On her mouth, there’s a shallow smile.</p>
 <p>“Asking <em>wangye </em>to not call me wrong again!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Longze Jing Tian to say something, Murong Qi Qi turned and went back inside the room and left the others hanging in the yard.</p>
 <p>“Stop!”</p>
 <p>Murong Tai shouted once. Murong Qi Qi not giving face to Longze Jing Tian like this, made Murong Tai feel very embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
