 <p>Chapter 47 Snobbish mother</p>
 <p>If Murong Qi Qi knew&nbsp;that&nbsp;Feng Cang’s mind was now full of thoughts on how to explore the taste of her lips, she would’ve let a slap hit his face. She would've let the hand Feng Cang loves so much go greet his devilish beautiful face.</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye</em>[1. Wangye/ wang: prince of the first rank], is it not better if you go change clothes… ….”</p>
 <p>Although Murong Qi Qi wiped off the rice on Feng Cang’s face, the soup on those white clothes couldn't be removed.</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi wiped it for quite a while&nbsp;before finally giving up. She hanged her head guiltily like a child who did something wrong and was waiting to be scolded by an adult.</p>
 <p>That look was so well behaved and so cute, making Feng Cang really happy. Then he looked at his clothes. It’s indeed dirty.</p>
 <p>If it was a normal day, Feng Cang would've long gone to change his clothes, but today's different. Murong Qi Qi was still here. Besides, the people here were not easy… …Thinking till here, Feng Cang asked Murong Qi Qi in a low gentle voice: “Qing Qing, is it alright if I leave for a moment?”</p>
 <p>“Is it alright?” It’s not asking Murong Qi Qi if he can leave, but it's asking Murong Qi Qi whether or not she can deal with the situation.</p>
 <p>Seeing Feng Cang being so careful, Murong Qi Qi finally revealed her first sincere smile of the day: “It’s not like <em>wangye </em>wouldn’t come back. I will wait for you here.”</p>
 <p>A ‘I wait for you’ made Feng Cang’s heart jump. So having someone waiting for you is so wonderful.</p>
 <p>“Wait for me!” Feng Cang pressed Murong Qi Qi’s hand. He stood up, swept his gaze over the crowd. His gaze especially stayed on Longze Yu Er, making her tremble.</p>
 <p>Knowing that Feng Cang was worried that while he's absent, Longze Yu Er would make trouble for her, hence the glaring, Murong Qi Qi was somewhat touched.</p>
 <p>So far, the care that this man has&nbsp;shown her was not fake. If his concern is false, then he can simply go and be an Oscar winner.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be back soon… …”</p>
 <p>Feng Cang, under the guide of servants, went to a side hall to change. The atmosphere at the Hall of Supreme Harmony became more lively because of his departure.</p>
 <p>They didn’t see Feng Cang scold Murong Qi Qi, some people felt slight regret. They were hoping to add salt to the wound. Shortly afterwards, dancers came up. The scene became bustling again.</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian’s gaze seemed to always be falling on Nan Feng’s princess Ming Yue Xin, making Murong Xin Lian, who's sitting next to him,&nbsp;feel sour. She's now more sure that Longze Jing Tian had taken a fancy to Ming Yue Xin and she's also more uneasy and worried about her future.</p>
 <p>After thinking for a moment, Murong Xin Lian finally stood up. She's the number one beauty in the capital and her talent is also outstanding. She can’t be pressed down like this by Ming Yue Xin. She must also show people her dance skills and attract Longze Jing Tian’s heart.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian volunteering to dance made Longze Yu very happy. Ming Yue Xin’s dance was superb. Xi Qi country couldn’t do a bad&nbsp;job compared to Nan Feng country.</p>
 <p>“<em>Zhen</em>[2. Zhen: I, used by an emperor] gives permission!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Xin Lian dance, both Duanmu Qing and Murong Xue Lian revealed a mysterious smile. Two pair of eyes closely watched Murong Xin Lian’s belly. They didn’t even leave for a second.</p>
 <p>Although knowing that she's pregnant and needed to rest, but now in the moment between life and death, Murong Xin Lian didn't&nbsp;want to give up the position of <em>wangfei</em>[3. Wangfei: main wife of a wangye] like this. She's gambling, gambling with the child in her belly. If she loses the child, but get Longze Jing Tian's favor, get the position of <em>wangfei</em>, then why shouldn’t she do it? If the child is alright and she can be w<em>angfei, </em>then that’s even better!</p>
 <p>Child, mother’s future is relying on you now. You must live up the expectations, ah! When she got on the scene, Murong Xin Lian gently touched her lower abdomen.</p>
 <p>This action went into Longze Jing Tian’s eyes. He sneered. This woman must’ve become crazy from wishing for power! In order to chase fame and fortune, she even gambled her child’s life. To this child, having such a mother is simply the saddest thing……</p>
 <p>After seeing such action from Murong Xin Lian, Longze Jing Tian couldn’t help but think about his own mother consort Xian He Xin Er.</p>
 <p>He Xin Er has passed away for many years, but her voice and expression remained in Longze Jing Tian’s heart. In the past, the imperial physician diagnosed that her body was too weak to have children, but after getting pregnant, she insisted on letting the child be born. That’s why there’s Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>Although for the next five years, He Xin Er spent her days in bed because of a too weak body and she also lost Longze Yu’s favor because of this, the love she had for Longze Jing Tian was the greatest and the most selfless. Even at the time when she had to leave this world, she didn’t forget to request Longze Yu to look after Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>Compared with He Xin Er, Murong Xin Lian doesn’t even have the right to be a mother! She also isn’t qualified to be a mother! Longze Jing Tian humphed coldly. In his heart, he has long sentenced Murong Xin Lian to death.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian couldn’t fathom Longze Jing Tian’s mood. Her body swayed according to the music. She danced Xi Qi country’s national dance----picking tea dance.</p>
 <p>Murong Xin Lian’s dress was too gorgeous. It didn’t express the meaning of the dance very well, but her dance was quite good. After all, for the title of the number one beauty, she also paid a lot of hard work. No matter if it’s the <em>qin</em> skills or the dance skills, she had intensive training.</p>
 <p>The people who knew that Ming Yue Xin came here to form a marriage alliance with Longze Jing Tian, after seeing Jing w<em>ang ce fei’s</em>[4. Wang cefei/ cefei: ssecond ranked wife of a wangye] performance, all knew what was going on. This <em>ce fei</em> must not be willing for the position of Jing <em>wangfei</em> to be taken away by another woman, that’s why she wanted to compete with Nan Feng’s princess.</p>
 <p>It seems that there will be a good show again! Those spectators, who had lost their hearts just now because of Murong Qi Qi, revived again. Don’t know who will be the final winner after this. Many people secretly compared the two in their hearts.</p>
 <p>As for the involved party Ming Yue Xin, at this moment, her attention was stuck on Murong Qi Qi. Compared to Longze Jing Tian, she's now more interested in Feng Cang. And Feng Cang’s future <em>wangfei </em>Murong Qi Qi has now become Ming Yue Xin’s rival.</p>
 <p>In just a moment, Ming Yue Xin got to know about Murong Qi Qi’s ‘glorious past’.</p>
 <p>Humph! Just a rubbish who was&nbsp;pushed forward as the ‘scapegoat’. What right does Murong Qi Qi have to compete with her?</p>
 <p>Ming Yue Xin doesn’t believe that Feng Cang would&nbsp;chose a rubbish as <em>wangfei</em> and that he isn’t tempted by her, a princess of a country! Men love country and love beauty. Murong Qi Qi couldn’t compete with her on beauty. Her (MQQ) family background is even more incomparable with hers (MYX). This bet, she will definitely win!</p>
 <p>However, Ming Yue Xin is more cautious than Longze Yu Er. Just now, everyone saw Feng Cang’s care towards Murong Qi Qi. She can’t be too rash, lest she would end up like that stupid Longze Yu Er who hasn’t even gambled yet, but has already lost from the start!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Ming Yue Xin’s mind is full of thoughts on how to grab Feng Cang’s attention and how to get his favor. She didn’t even care about Murong Xin Lian and also put all the words that He Lan Min had told her before she came here at the back of her mind.</p>
 <p>After Murong Xin Lian stopped while panting, Longze Yu was the first to clap.</p>
 <p>“Award!”</p>
 <p>Longze Yu seemed very happy.</p>
 <p>A ‘award’ made Murong Xin Lian felt that she had already won half of it. The remaining half must rely on luck! She couldn’t help but glance at Longze Jing Tian. The first thing she wants to know is if he's satisfied with her performance.</p>
