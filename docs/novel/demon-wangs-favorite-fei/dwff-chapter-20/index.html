 <p>Chapter 20:&nbsp;Meeting Longze Jing Tian Once Again</p>
 <p>“Hehe, big brother you don’t need to worry about these. <em>Bengong </em>[1. Bengong: this palace, I used by the females of the imperial family] has already promised him that I’ll break off the engagement of Jing <em>wang</em>[2. Wang/wangye: the prince of first rank] and Murong Qi Qi and let him get the beauty. Such a person like him won’t play tricks.”</p>
 <p>Talking till here, Duanmu Qing suddenly envied Murong Qi Qi. Although she didn’t have talent nor beauty, but there was such a handsome man who had fallen at her feet. The pitiful one was her. Although she was Duanmu family’s eldest miss, is the head of the six palaces, is the empress, but how was the emperor treating her……</p>
 <p>The imperial’s grace was fleeting, so she must give birth to a crown prince! The hand in Duanmu Qing’s sleeves clenched into a fist.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Mi, miss…….”</p>
 <p>Su Yue, who was waiting at the door, saw Murong Qi Qi being pulled by a man, her chin almost fell off. Who was this man? He dared to put his hands on miss!</p>
 <p>“Let go!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi wantws to pull her hand back, but the other party grabbed it tighter.</p>
 <p>“Not letting go!”</p>
 <p>Lian <em>gongzi </em>[3. Gongzi: young master/ also used to refer to a famous unmarried man]still has a playful expression, but Murong Qi Qi couldn’t read the mood flashing in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Do you want to die?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s eyes burned with anger. It had always been her who had everything in her grasp, when did it become that others could meddle in her things? No matter who this man was, she had no interest. If he continued to be like this, then don’t blame her for being ruthless!</p>
 <p>Seeing Murong Qi Qi’s eyes exuding wild light like a leopard in the forest, the way Lian <em>gongzi </em>looked at her began to become admiration.</p>
 <p>Indeed, the woman <em>wang </em>&gt; had selected! Could it be that the things that had entered <em>wang’s </em>eyes were this arrogance and the rebelliousness in her eyes? However, these were far from enough, enough for you to stay by that man’s side. Murong Qi Qi, I still want to see your ability that made <em>wang </em>give you special treatment……</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, you hid it really deep, ah……”</p>
 <p>Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>breath was light and very warm, stroking Murong Qi Qi’s earlobe.</p>
 <p>“What are you two doing?!”</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Murong Qi Qi to counterattack, a thundering voice came. Looking at the direction, don’t know since when, there were now a few more people led by Jing <em>wang </em>Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>At this time, Longze Jing Tian’s expression was very livid. Standing behind him were Duanmu Hong Chen, Shangguan Wu Ji and Li Yun Qing.</p>
 <p>Li Yun Qing and Shangguan Wu Ji heard about the matter of the empress letting Murong Qi Qi search for Lian <em>gongzi</em>, they were worried about her. After finding out that Lian <em>gongzi </em>was at Duanmu residence, the two came and happened to encounter Duanmu Hong Chen inviting Longze Jing Tian over. They had just arrived and saw this scene. From their point of view, it was Lian <em>gongzi </em>who kissed Murong Qi Qi……</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>you saw it! She is Murong Qi Qi!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Hong Chen’s lips revealed a sarcastic smile. Murong Qi Qi was being so intimate with a man in the open, no man would be able to accept it, let alone Longze Jing Tian.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Hong Chen’s expression made Li Yun Qing understand. He deliberately invited Longze Jing Tian along to watch this scene.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Wu Ji felt really uncomfortable. He felt like he was about to lose something important.</p>
 <p>“Shameless!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian glared angrily at this ‘cheating couple’. Although he didn’t fancy Murong Qi Qi and wanted to break off the engagement, but the other party was still his fiancée in name. His fiancée was entangled with another man and had been seen by so many people. Where should he, Longze Jing Tian, put his face?!</p>
 <p>“Qi Qi, he is talking about us!”</p>
 <p>Lian <em>gongzi</em> simply pulled Murong Qi Qi into his embrace. His beautiful pair of eyes looked at Longze Jing Tian, full of provocation.</p>
 <p>“Is he your fiancée? I see, he is just so so, how can he compare to the handsome me?! Qi Qi, why don’t you reconsider; kick him out and go with me, alright?”</p>
 <p>Lian <em>gongzi </em>lifted a wisp of Murong Qi Qi’s hair and rolled it around his finger.</p>
 <p>“I promise you, from my head to my toe, I’m clean. Not like him who has long been sullied by the fragrance of those women. You won’t be interested in such a disgusting man……”</p>
 <p>Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>action provoked Longze Jing Tian’s anger.</p>
 <p>His things, even if it was a woman he didn’t want, before he had abandoned it, it was definitely not allowed to betray him. Otherwise, it couldn’t be forgiven!</p>
 <p>“Murong Qi Qi, today I finally got to know how cheap you are!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian already knew that the other party was strange doctor Lian<em>gongzi</em>. In some aspect, he couldn’t get into his bad side, so he put all the blame on Murong Qi Qi.</p>
 <p>“It’s alright to not have such a slut like you!”</p>
 <p>“Good, if you have the ability then write a break of engagement letter, ah?”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi finally understood Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>motive. Seeing him provoke Longze Jing Tian so brazenly, he (Lian) must have come to break her engagement. This was what she, Murong Qi Qi, desired!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Murong Qi Qi grabbed Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>neck and played with his hair provocatively. The same gesture. Now it was her turn to provoke.</p>
 <p>“If you’re a man, then quickly help us. A gentleman should have the grace of helping people. If it’s not yours, then don’t use force to get it! <em>Wangye, </em>a fruit got by force is not sweet. Qi Qi’s heart already has someone.”</p>
 <p>“<em>Benwang </em>[4. Benwang: this king, I used by the prince of first rank] forced you? <em>Benwang </em>will force this rubbish? <em>Benwang, </em>I, I……”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian nearly vomited blood. How did he become a person who ‘rob someone in love’, someone who was blocking another’s fate? He was someone who can’t wait to break off the engagement!</p>
 <p>“Good, Murong Qi Qi, very good! Don’t regret! Servant, get a brush for<em>benwang</em>!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>don’t be impulsive!”</p>
 <p>The moment he heard that Longze Jing Tian wanted to write a letter of breaking off the engagement, Shangguan Wu Ji immediately grabbed his arm.</p>
 <p>“Breaking off an engagement is very damaging to a girl’s reputation! <em>Wangye,</em>think it through, ah!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Wangye, </em>your marriage has been decreed by the emperor. If the emperor knew that <em>wangye </em>broke it off in secret, I’m afraid……”</p>
 <p>At the other side, Li Yun Qing also verbally stopped Longze Jing Tian and let him calm down. Although he didn’t know why Murong Qi Qi was being like this, but if Longze Jing Tian wrote down the ‘break off engagement’ letter, Murong Qi Qi’s reputation would be gone!</p>
 <p>“Lian, you once said that your biggest wish was to let another raise your son. It seems that your wish will be realized soon.”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi pulled Lian <em>gongzi’s </em>hand and carefully put it on her belly.</p>
 <p>“In fact, I also feel that the surname Longze is really nice in the ears!”</p>
 <p>Murong Qi Qi’s words made Lian <em>gongzi </em>froze for a moment. Then seeing the slyness flash in her eyes, he smiled. This woman was indeed interesting. She even abandoned the virginity that everyone cared about the most. It seemed that she also couldn’t wait to withdrew from the political marriage. <em>Wang </em>was actually worried that she had a crush on Longze Jing Tian and especially let him make this trip. Now it seemed that it was really unnecessary. She would’ve been able to do all of this……</p>
 <p>“You! Murong Qi Qi, you are simply shameless to the extreme!”</p>
 <p>Longze Jing Tian, who had been persuaded and got some of his senses back, couldn’t hold it in anymore. She hadn’t even married but has already made him wear a green hat. No matter what, he couldn’t have such a woman!</p>
