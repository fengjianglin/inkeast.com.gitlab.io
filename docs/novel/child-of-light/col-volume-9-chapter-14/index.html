 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Volume 9: Chapter&nbsp;14 - Xiao Jin&nbsp;Returns</b></span></p>
 <p><span style>I dejectedly looked at the demon fox on my shoulder. “It seems that I won’t be able to bring you along in the future. If I’d paid more attention, perhaps everything that happened &nbsp;wouldn’t have happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ke Lun Duo said, “Zhang Gong, you all should &nbsp;just surrender. I’ll plead mercy for you in front of His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I clenched my teeth and said, “Ke Lun Duo, stop being a hypocrite! Currently, I just want to eat your meat, and peel your skin off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ke Lun Duo helplessly smiled, and pointed at Zhan Hu, and Dong Ri, who had both fainted. “It can’t be that you don’t care about their life, right? I captured them so as to avoid unnecessary injuries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I took in a deep breath and viciously glared at him. With my heart overflowing with hatred, I shouted, “Big brother Zhan Hu, Dong Ri, and the God’s village brother, I hate to cause trouble for you. Demon Emperor, I want to challenge you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon King said astonished, “You want to challenge me in this situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I coldly said, “That’s right! Do you dare &nbsp;accept my challenge? If you win, everyone of us will surrender unconditionally. If you lose, you’re to let us go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Emperor chuckled. “Human, you really are outstanding. I don’t know how long it has &nbsp;been since someone has challenged me. Alright! I’ll accept.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ke Lun Duo anxiously said, “Your Majesty, I think it’s better that I do it. You’re too invaluable to do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shouted, “You don’t have the qualification.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Emperor replied, “Brat, I really want to see the capabilities that enable you to be this savage. Ke Lun Duo, you’re to command your subordinates to move back. I want to be enlightened on this human’s skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I said, “Alright! You’re worthy to be the demon race’s King. I, Zhang Gong Wei, will be enlightened by the skills that the demon race’s top expert possesses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Emperor asked in astonishment, “Zhang Gong Wei, you’re the human’s Magister, Zhang Gong Wei that &nbsp;killed a few hundred of the demon race’s experts in Aixia?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stopped caring already and arrogantly nodded saying, “That’s right! It was me. You want to seek vengeance for your subordinate? Come at me then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the aura that the Demon King emitted, I knew I was not his match. If Big brother Zhan Hu, and Dong Ri were here, with the power of three of us, we should be able to fight against him; that was still under the condition that the Dark Demon Dragon didn’t participate. No matter what, I’ve got to give it my all. At the very least, if I lose, everyone should just be detained, and wouldn’t be in any mortal danger temporarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon King’s surrounding aura started to become violent. A black halo was emitted from his body. With a sneer on his face, he stepped forward and heavily punched out. The circular dark energy spiraled as it headed towards me. </span></p>
 <p><span style>I calmed down, and circulated the three gold dans in my body. I hollered as I struck out a light blade filled with power. When the light blade and the dark energy collided, I was rebounded by it, and pushed 10 steps back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Emperor’s eyes showed surprise as he said, “Good, kid since you’re able to receive my punch, you’re qualified to be my opponent.” Just as he wanted to continue to attack, &nbsp;a loud dragon roar sounded in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wiped the blood traces from the corner of my mouth. That sound was really familiar. </span><i><span style>Ah!</span></i><span style> It was Xiao Jin. Xiao Jin had come over at the most critical point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shouted, filled with feelings, “Xiao Jin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was suddenly an enormous gold light ray that appeared in the sky; it was as bright as the sun as it charged towards us. The Demon Emperor was so shocked that he forgot to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dark Demon Dragon in the sky let out a low roar, emitting black fog throughout its body before it suddenly charged towards the gold light ray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the gold and dark light ray collided. There was the sound of tearing in the sky. The gold light had been forced back by the black light; it was obvious that it was at a large disadvantage. The violent energy from the collision had caused the troops to lean unsteadily from side to side. The Demon Emperor shouted, “Ke Lun Duo, quickly command the entire Radiant protectors to retreat 5 Km from here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the gold light dimmed, it revealed Xiao Jin’s familiar appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was finally able to see some hope in this impasse. I was elated as Xiao Jin was much bigger than before. His body was more than 99 metres and the scales on his body were much larger; his entire body emitted the aura of a king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dark Demon Dragon suddenly spoke in human language, “Five Clawed dragon?D Could it be that you’re this generation’s Dragon King? That old fellow died already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin also spoke in a youthful voice, “You’re the one that’s dead. My father is still living perfectly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dark Demon Dragon sighed, “Child, do you know that I’m your uncle……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two dragons were conversing in the sky, the Demon Emperor and I didn’t dally. The Demon Emperor said, “You also have a dragon? Not bad, it seems that we can really have a fun match. Since we both have dragons, let’s mount them and fight.” His words suited my desires. I nodded before I forced my powers to surge outwards and instantly leapt up. The Demon Emperor followed behind as he also left the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>We individually landed on Xiao Jin and the Dark Demon Dragon’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xiao Jin and the Dark Demon Dragon conversed, &nbsp;he saw me heading towards him, he conveyed a warm state of mind towards me. As I stood on his large head and held on one of his horns, I asked, “Xiao Jin, how are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin replied, “Master, I’m doing well. I had already recovered the true dragon’s power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dark Demon Dragon replied, “A five clawed dragon can also have a master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin replied in anger, “Why can’t I? Didn’t you also betray our dragon clan to be a mount for the Demon Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dark Demon Dragon unexpectedly wasn’t enraged. He heavily sighed, “Child, do you think that I’ve betrayed the dragon clan? It was those fellows that forced me to. Initially………”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Emperor seemed to really respect the Dark Demon Dragon and didn’t stop him from talking but rather just quietly listened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I, wouldn’t interrupt them either as I wanted to quickly recover the injuries I got from that last exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Initially, your father and I were born at the same time. The entire clan was extremely elated, as we were the first twin dragons with five claws in the history of the dragon clan. When we were born, we looked identical.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When I paid attention and looked, the Dark Demon Dragon also had five claws and looked very similar to Xiao Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dark Demon Dragon continued to say, “However, 20 years after, our looks gradually became different. The main changes were the dragon scales on our body; your father’s scales become increasingly golden while mine gradually turned black. Initially, the clan didn’t have any response. When we grew out of infancy, I came to have my current looks, but was much smaller. The clan’s men started to reject me as they all said that black dragons were bad omens that would bring misfortune to the dragon clan. They unanimously pleaded to the Dragon King at that time, who was your grandfather and my father, to kill me.”</span></p>
