 <p><span style>Name: Qi Meng Satan</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sex: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Emperor&nbsp;of the Demon race, top expert of the Demon race and Mu Zi’s father. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Dark Demon Dragon</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sex: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Emperor’s mount and a loyal protector.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Su He</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sex: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon&nbsp;Emperor’s second son, his status?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Fifth Elder</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sex: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ancestor of the Holy Sword that accepted the task from the God to set up the God Village. He is the current God Village’s top expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Jian Shan</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sex: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>Radiant knight of the God Village’s young generation, he’s a well-known figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Wallace</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sex: Male</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leader of the beast clans that had a outspoken and straightforward personality, holds the ‘Earth Bear’ title and is good in Earth elemental magic. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After a golden light flashed, a slender body appeared on a hill. It was surrounded by a verdant and lush forest that had frequent calls from birds and insects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A body figure that was about 1.9 meters tall slowly appeared. He was doing a handstand on the hill with his eyes staring at the horizon with his eyebrows expressing sorrow. That man was me. The widely known light magician in the Kingdom of Aixia, Zhang Gong Wei, who is also the main character of this book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had finally succeeded in escaping. After thinking back to the deep feelings Hai Shui had for me, my heart involuntarily throbs. Furthermore, I still also have Mu Zi that should already be deep inside the demon race territory, who is the woman I love the most. I would really never have thought that she would unexpectedly be the princess of the &nbsp;Demon race. Even if that was the case, I had saved her when she was captured by Aixia’s Royal Magic corps, which had also ruined my future in Aixia.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I must go to the </span></i><span style>&nbsp;Demon</span><i><span style> race to find Mu Zi because I love her. It’s impossible for me to forget her.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I wondered how Big brother Zhan Hu and the rest were. If I could get their assistance, the journey to the &nbsp;Demon race territory would be much smoother so I had decided to head to the Kingdom of Xiuda to find them. After that, I would head for the Demon race. I was not worried about going to the Demon magic races lands as I had complete confidence in my powers. What I was most afraid was that Mu Zi would abandon me or wasn’t willing to come back with me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After determining the destination to head towards, my heart felt much better. I raised my head and gave out a long roar. I kicked off from the ground and circulated my battle spirit as I flew down the hill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I currently had already lost my sense of position as when I escaped, the magic array was designated to head towards the west. This was to say that this place should be 500 kilometers west from Aixia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>I shall forget about it and just head in this direction. I should be able to reach a city. When I find one, I’ll just determine the correct direction I should move in</span></i><span style>.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hadn’t thought such an error in my decision making had forced me to spend three days in the forest. If I knew Advanced wind magic, I perhaps wouldn’t need to spend so much time in here. However, my major was light magic and minor was spatial magic, that weren’t capable in allowing me to fly. Even though I could fly with my battle spirit, my current body condition wasn’t good. My body strength was half of the power from my strength at peak condition. It shouldn’t be able to fly for long but I could use short teleportation. This was bad after rapidly teleporting for a day. I discovered that I was completely lost. Damn it! I didn’t dare to continue using the short teleportation anymore so I could only conscientiously depend on my both legs to proceed. After I finally walked out of the forest, I already looked like a beggar. My clothing had already be shredded by the shrubbery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the torture from the stone prison that made me exhausted and that I didn’t rest up properly after Hai Shui had rescued me, with the fact that I currently was out of food, the condition of my magic power and battle spirit were all not good, especially my battle spirit. The reason for that was I had previously used it to support my body so the consumption of it was large.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My pitiful Sukrad’s staff was currently being used as my walking stick. I previously had always had a smooth sailing life and never suffered this much. I sighed as I couldn’t help but to think back to my past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hobbled as I moved forward. There was suddenly a spiral of smoke in front of me. I instantly felt a little energetic as if there was smoke, it was a sign of presence of humans there. This was too awesome! I used my entire body’s power to charge forward. When I stepped on a small hill, &nbsp;I finally saw a large village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a light shone through my hopelessness, I was exceptionally excited. My body seemed to have lightened a lot. I cheered before heading to the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I neared it, I heard the sounds of water. There was a river flowing at the side of the village. There was a 30 to 40 meter high waterfall upstream. It looked like this water supplies this village. The scale of the area was counted to be big as it catered about six to seven hundred houses. The houses were all built with wood and bamboo. The place was surrounded by mountains, making it seemed extremely tranquil. I had unexpectedly found such a large village in such a remote area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment that I could see the village entrance, under the irradiation of the intense sunlight, I couldn’t refrain myself from getting light headed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear voice voiced out, “Who are you? Why have you come to our village?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stared at the direction of the voice. He seemed to be a 18 to 19 years old young fellow. He looked tall and stalwart with his entire body reeking with explosive power. There was an unknown beast in his hand. From the looks of it, he should be a hunter. However, from the bearing of his body and explosive power, he seemed to an expert in martial skills. There was unexpectedly someone that practiced martial skills in Aixia. This was really strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I replied politely, “Brother, I’m just a passerby that is overly exhausted. I’m thinking of purchasing some food and water from the village to rest up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man frowned as he sized me up. “Alright, follow me.” After he said that, he lead in front of me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry for the trouble.” I used the Sukrad’s staff to support my body as I forcefully followed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the village, there was a couple of young men, whose ages were still very young.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Jian Shan, you’re back.</span><i><span style> Wah! </span></i><span style>You caught another Purple Fox! You’re really great!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is our Big brother Jian Shan, the number one expert among the younger generation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man who brought me in smiled and said, “That’s enough! You all stop flattering me. If the elders heard that, they will remark that you all are not being discreet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The few youngsters stuck their tongue out at him but didn’t dare to say anything. One of them that had a good eye and asked, “Big brother Jian Shan, who is he? Where did you get this beggar from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jian Shan rebuked, “Shan Dou, stop talking nonsense. He should just be lost. You go and report to the Great Elder to let him decide whether to keep this outsider or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that was known as Shan Dou gave out a peculiar sound before turning and running away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jian San told me, “ Big brother, come with me.” After he said that, he brought me to a bamboo house at the western side of the village. I replied pantingly, “Thank you, brother.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jian Shan poured a cup of water and passed it to me. “You can try our spring water. It’s not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I drank all of the clear spring water. A chilly feeling passed through my body. </span><i><span style>Ah! </span></i><span style>I replied in appreciation, “This spring water is really nice to to drink, is this water from the flowing spring at the side of the village?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jian Shan nodded before pouring me another cup of spring water. “The spring water is our village’s lifeline. Without it constantly flowing all around the year, our village wouldn’t be able to survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I drank, I said, “That’s right! Water is the origin of life.” As I said that, I couldn’t help but to think about Hai Shui who was so far from here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Jian Shan, the elder wants you to bring that stranger to meet him.” Shan Dou’s voice sounded out from outside of the room.</span></p>
