 <p><span style>I continuously expressed my support for Mu Zi’s words. Teacher Zhen’s expression changed, as he had never thought that we would pick that place. As the Royal Advanced Magic Academy’s Principal, he definitely knew what the price of the food at that place was like. He bitterly smiled, “It’s too expensive at that place, can we change the place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi and I stubbornly shook our head. Mu Zi said, “Nope! If you want to change the place, then you have to change the participants as we won’t be participating in the competition.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Teacher Zhen’s thoughts were that even if Mu Zi didn’t want to go, it would be totally fine as the main competitor he wanted was me. He lowered his head and considered for a bit. If Mu Zi didn’t go, I won’t go. Forget it! He clenched his teeth and said, “Alright! It is decided then.” He would just find Prince Ke Zha and ask him to reimburse him in the future. Thinking about that point, Teacher Zhen smiled happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I said satisfied, “That’s great! Since that is settled, we will head back to pack up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Teacher Zhen nodded. “You’ll gather at the entrance of the academy at 9 o’clock tomorrow morning and head out together. You should have a map. Do you know how to get there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I nodded. “You don’t have to worry about that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Teacher Zhen fixed his expression and said, “You’re the most talented students of the academy. Please stay safe on your journey. The competition has a dreadful rule. Although it will still be forbidden to kill their opponent, they can seriously injure them or even mutilate them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I turned pale with fright. “What?! Why is there such a horrific rule?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Teacher Zhen sighed. “Who knows? The rule has already been in place for a very long time. The reason was that too many restrictions would make competitors unable to brandish all of their strength; which in turn affects their advancement. However, I have complete trust in you, or are you perhaps not confident in your abilities?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn! It looks like Mu Zi was right, there is actually such a conspiracy</span></i><span style>. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi replied, “We’ll head back first then.” After she said that, she dragged my stunned body out of the office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he saw us leave, Teacher Zhen muttered, “I hope that you will return safely. This is also the best chance for you to train.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the school ended for the day, we went to find Ma Ke. After meeting him, I asked him, “Do you know about the competition already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke’s expression dampened before he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked curiously, “Why &nbsp;are you looking so distressed? What’s the matter? You’re a magic scholar. It can’t be that you’re scared to lose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke sighed and said, “Boss, you just don’t know how abnormal the Triennial National Advanced Magic Academies’ competition is. I’m getting worried just thinking about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I patted his shoulder. “I know about that. Isn’t it because the competition doesn’t forbid anyone to actually seriously injure their opponent? It shouldn’t matter as I’m leading the team. What are you so afraid of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke shook his head. “It’s not only that. The competition allows all of the other seven Advanced Magic Academies, except ours, to send out their teachers to participate in the competition. Boss, did you know that all of the academies are using the defeat of our Royal Advanced Magic Academy to gain glory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, astonished, “What! Teachers are allowed to participate in the competition. Isn’t that just too unfair?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi calmly said, “Why is that unfair? If they don’t allow the teachers to compete and use only their students,they won’t be even able to lift our shoes. I had already told you that Teacher Zhen won’t give you an easy mission. So that’s how it really is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke continued to say, “Mu Zi’s analysis is right. The other academies all have magic scholars for Principals. Magic scholar teachers are very rare. In the past, there have been a few academies that sent five teachers to compete in the competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, “What was the final outcome? Who was the champion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke replied, “It was our academy that had brought back the championship. However, there were only two people that were able to walk back on their own. One of them is the Academy’s top ranker, Si Wa Ming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I muttered, “Only two people that can walk back on their own, so it will mean that the others…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke nodded. “That’s right! One was seriously injured while the other two competitors were crippled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was abnormal. I replied, “Sorry, brother! I’ve gotten you involved, as I was the the one who asked Teacher Zhen to nominate you. I’ve really caused you trouble this time. I wouldn’t have let you come with me, if I had known that it would be this dangerous. You should follow me to Teacher Zhen’s place, so that I can help you remove your name from the list. Teacher Zhen will definitely approve, if uncle Ke Zha is with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke shook his head. “It’s useless Boss! It’s my father that has arranged for me to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi frowned, “Why? You’re his dearest son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke replied, “My father has very high expectations for me, and equally stringent demands towards me at the same time. This is an extremely good chance for me to train, so I must participate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sighed, “I actually thought of creating a chance for you to get closer to Hai Yue. I haven’t thought that it will be such an abnormal competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke was greatly alarmed. “What! Hai Yue is also going? It can’t be!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I awkwardly smiled. “That’s correct, Hai Yue is also coming as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi consoled Ma Ke, “This is really an opportunity. You can only express your sincere feelings for her when in dangerous times. You can relax as we had arranged her to fight the last match. If we can get three victories before her turn, she will be safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke nodded and looked at me. “Boss! I really don’t know if I should scold you or thank you instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sighed. “It’s all my fault. I didn’t clarify before easily agreeing to it. Isn’t Mu Zi also going to experience such danger? No matter how difficult it will be, we must protect the &nbsp;Mu Zi and Hai Yue’s safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke replied, “Let’s do that! I’ll go and pack up as we will leave tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After bidding Ma Ke farewell, Mu Zi and I looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I held her hand and said, “Mu Zi, I’m really sorry. I’ve forced you to participate in such a terrifying competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi leaned towards me and hugged my waist lightly. “Since I was young, I have never known what it is to be afraid. Isn’t it more thrilling this way? Don’t worry, everything will be fine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hugged her tightly and felt that my emotions had stabilized a lot.</span><i><span style> I swore to myself that I would use my very life to protect her and not let her suffer even the tiniest bit of harm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After sending Mu Zi back to the dormitory, I didn’t return to mine. I left the academy, even though the sky had completely darkened. I would be out for one to two months. I wanted to let Teacher Di know about this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After reaching the Intermediate Magic Academy, I related the entire situation to Teacher Di.</span></p>
