 <p><span style>Xiao Rou hastily hid behind me and shivered even more violently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I said, “Don’t be scared, Xiao Rou. Xiao Jin won’t hurt you. Xiao Jin, how can you call her little sister? She’s older than you by a few hundred years. You should call her older sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin was stunned, then he hastily corrected his words. “Older sister Xiao Rou, I’m known as Xiao Jin. Please take care of me from now on. If anybody bullies you, you can tell me. I’ll stick out for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smiling, Zhan Hu said, “Xiao Jin, when did you join the criminal underworld? It’ll be great if you join our bandit group. </span><i><span style>Haha</span></i><span style>!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Rou saw that Xiao Jin didn’t have any bad intentions, she boldly stuck her head out from behind my back to size Xiao Jin up before whispering, “Your golden sparkling scales are so beautiful!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin said, proudly, “Of course, I’m the prettiest in the Dragon race. Elder sis, you also look really beautiful.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>I patted Xiao Jin’s large head. “Xiao Jin, stop joking around. I have something that I’ll need your help with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin replied seriously, “What’s the matter, Master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I took out a previously written letter. “You’re to head to our base to find Big Brother Xiu Si and pass this letter to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin suddenly shook his head like a rattle drum and said, “I don’t want to! I’m not going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was momentarily stunned. Xiao Jin had never disobeyed my request. Why would he do it now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin stopped shaking his head and tears flowed down from his large eyes. Choked with emotions, he said, “Master, I’ve reunited with you with such difficulty. Please let me to stay by your side and protect you. Xiao Jin doesn’t want to leave you. I’m begging you, ok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My eyes instantly reddened. Xiao Jin had such deep feelings towards me. I caressed his large head and said emotionally, “Xiao Jin, behave and stop crying. I don’t have a choice. The risk of heading back to the </span><span style>Ström Fortress isn’t much lesser than being in the Demon race. Your task is extremely important. I promise you that after you have accomplished this task, I won’t separate from you ever again, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Hu asked, “Zhang Gong, isn’t it just sending a letter? Is it that urgent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sighed and replied, “Big brother, you should know that I’m currently a wanted person from Aixia. It won’t be easy to convince the three kingdoms. We’ll need to use the God’s inheritor’s name. Even though we aren’t weak, it won’t be enough to face the three kingdoms’ millions of soldiers. It’s always better to have more powers, so I want Xiao Jin to send the letter and ask Big Brother Xui Si, Xin Ao, and Gao De to bring along some elites to assist us. With the six divine instruments, we don’t need to fear anything. When necessary, we can use their power to frighten the three kingdoms in order to accomplish our objectives. Among us, only Xiao Jin can fly for a long period of time and only he has enough power to fly past the </span><span style>Heavenly Falling Mountain with great speed. After sending the letter, Big Brother Xiu Si and the rest could join up with us as soon as possible. Time is pressing. I’m reluctant to be separated from Xiao Jin, but under the present conditions, I must do precisely that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Ri said, “Zhang Gong is right. Our trip back will be really dangerous. Only with Big Brother Xiu Si’s intelligence and Zhang Gong’s planned strategy will we succeed with this task. I agree with Zhang Gong’s suggestion.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin unwillingly took the letter from my hands. I took out a map from the space pocket and showed him the location of the base before reminding him, “Xiao Jin, you must head there at top speed and pass the letter to Big Brother before you come back to find us. I know that you know how to find us. Actually, it won’t take a long time before we meet again, so don’t be sad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Jin nodded dejectedly. “Master, you must keep true to your words. After returning, Xiao Jin won’t ever leave you again.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>I stuck my face to his head. No matter how I looked, Xiao Jin’s feelings for me wouldn’t ever change. “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely keep my words. Take care of yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, I’ll head out now, so that I can come back earlier. Just wait for my good news.” Upon saying that, he flapped his wings and soared into the sky. After a few words, Xiao Jin was leaving me again. I felt the emotions surging in my heart and how I loathed parting from him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi walked over to my side and whispered, “If I were to be gone, would you be that reluctant then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My body shuddered and I turned my head to come face to face with her gaze, filled with hidden bitterness. I controlled my emotions while I whispered, “Princess must be joking with me. I’m just a commoner. How could I even think about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi sighed. “Can I talk to you late at night today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shook my head. “Your fiancé is here. I don’t think it’s good for you to be meeting alone with a guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi replied, slightly displeased, “I’m not afraid, so what are you afraid of? Can it be that you’re not even willing to talk with me for a little while?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her slightly displeased look, my heart softened, so I nodded my head while smiling wryly. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi nodded her head with satisfaction before turning around and walked aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I told Zhan Hu, “Since we’ve already reunited with Xiao Jin, we should head out. With so many people, I’m not confident I’ll be able to teleport all of us there. To avoid any incidents, I’ll have to trouble all of you to fly.” Upon saying that, my battle spirit surged and I took the lead, soaring up into the sky. I hovered in the sky, waiting for everyone to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone finished tidying up their belongings, and met me in mid-air. Just like that, about a dozen of us started flying towards </span><span style>Ström Fortress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>　　……</span></p>
 <p><span style>As night gradually fell, everyone was extremely tired after flying for a full day. We chose a dense forest as a resting place. Xiao Rou hunted our food, as usual, and Big Brother Zhan Hu cooked it. After our meal, excluding me, who was charged with keeping a lookout for the night, everyone had already went to rest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>I leaned on a large tree and looked at the bright moonlight. I felt indescribably uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Gong, I’ve come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My entire body shuddered when I turned around to see Mu Zi, who had recovered her exceptional looks. She had lost weight again. With a slight smile on her face, she leisurely walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess, you’ve come. What do you want to talk about with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi walked over until she was just a foot away from me. With her orchid-like scent coming over, I couldn’t help but to feel light headed. I inwardly knocked on a wake up bell at my heart. I mustn’t lose control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you not call me princess? There are no outsiders here. Call me Mu Zi, like you always did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t dare, since our status is different.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi chuckled a little. “What status are you talking about? Firstly, I’m a demoness and you’re human. We’re of different species. Do I have a status at your human side as the princess of the Demon race? Moreover, you’re a God’s inheritor. Your status should be higher than me judging by that. Call me Mu Zi, ok?”</span></p>
