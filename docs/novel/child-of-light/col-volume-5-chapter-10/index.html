 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 5: Chapter 10 - Dual Academy Withdrawal</strong></span></p>
 <p><span style>After some time, the vice Principal of the Si Long Advanced Magic Academy snapped back from his shock, running over to embrace Hua De while glaring at me with rage. Hua De was his beloved pupil, and thus, Hua De’s arrogant and domineering persona grew as a result of his constant pampering. But this time, he was unlucky to have met and angered me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I coldly smiled. “You should really educate your student when you head back. You should have known that words are able to cause a great deal of trouble. I held back this time, but if he were to anger me again... I won’t be as polite as I was this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The face of Contemplation’s vice Principal glowed crimson red, and he raised his hand, shooting a fireball at me. “I will stake everything and fight you!” Just when I wanted to counter his attack, Si Wa had already moved in front of me to cast an earth shield, blocking it. “Vice Principal, please conduct yourself with dignity. Zhang Gong won the fight against your student fair and square.” he said, as his lips curled into a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vice Principal of Contemplation knew he couldn’t fight against us. He carried the severely injured Hua De withanger still painted on his face, and walked to the front of Forest Dragon’s Principal. “Our Contemplation Academy no longer has the face to stay. Principal Long Yu, we forfeit this competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Principal Long Yu knew he wouldn’t be able to make him stay. He could only turn to his vice Principal while his own heart filled with dread... “I will remember all of you. The humiliation and the hatred from injuring my disciple; I won’t ever let this go that easily. Let’s go!” said the vice Principal of Contemplation, while glowering intensely. And with that being said, he exited with his other disciples to pack up their belongings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Si Wa walked in front of Principal Long Yu and said, “Principal, we are sorry about creating trouble for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What could Principal Long Yu even say? He was too frightened by my strength. He smiled. “You’re not to be blamed. It was they who were too domineering, not you. We should, however, return and continue our meal..” I thought,</span><i><span style> ‘This old fox, he didn’t stop our match. It is likely he wanted to gain even a small insight into what amount of power we hold. I will just act dumb this time... I also have no regrets in beating away the Contemplation Advanced Academy so quickly, as we can frighten Forest Dragon, and I also gave Mu Zi her revenge.’</span></i><span style> Instead, I am elated! What I didn’t thought about is how the Contemplation Magic Academy had actually gone back in anger. This was great, one less enemy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi pulled me, who was still furious, back to the diner. The Principal and vice Principal of Forest Dragon Academy were definitely more courteous than before. He kept on adding more dishes for us. I had listened to Si Wa prior to the fight, and I was still hungry… But I didn’t care anymore. I pulled Mu Zi along, and beneath the shocked eyes of the surrounding people, I ate my meal like a savage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The end of this ‘sumptuous’ lunch finally came about, and so, we bid the Principal of Forest Dragon farewell and prepared to head to our rooms for some rest. However, the head instructor of the Shell Order Advanced Magic Academy spoke at that moment. “Can you please wait for a moment before leaving? I wish to announce something with all of us here.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>We stopped and waited to hear what he had to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Principal Long Yu of Forest Dragon Academy could already feel like it was going to be bad news. “We have just seen the strength of student Zhang Gong and feel that our Shell Order Academy is unable to compete against him. Therefore, I have decided, in order not to disgrace myself, to forfeit from this competition as well,” said the head instructor of Shell Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Principal Long Yu hastily replied, “How can you say that? Don’t we have an agreement?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if there is an agreement, I won’t allow my students to risk their lives,” replied the head instructor without hesitation. “You also witnessed the fight. Can you guarantee that even you yourself would have been able to block that strike? My academy’s power is weak, and Hua De fought today! My team doesn’t even have a single magic scholar, how could we possibly compete? I’m sorry, but we’re leaving…” After he said that, he took away his students and even walked right past us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although we also bid our farewells, the difference was that we headed to our hotel, which was arranged by Forest Dragon. It actually wasn’t that bad since they gave us a large suite. A huge lounge welcomed us, while two bathrooms and five bedrooms were spread along the sides. The decorations weren’t very magnificent, but all of the necessities were there. The main satisfaction, however, was in its cleanliness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke lay comfortably on the couch in the lounge. “</span><i><span style>Wah</span></i><span style>! Our results today weren’t too bad. We just got here, and we already beat one academy and managed to scare away another. Our opponent only has five academies left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though the situation seems advantageous to us, don’t you think we have exposed some of our capabilities a little too much? This will only increase their jealousy toward us.” Si Wa said with a deep frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! What Si Wa said makes sense.” Mu Zi nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I muttered, “I’ve already contributed my portion to that. . I had said that I would defeat him with one strike, so…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Si Wa smiled. “We can’t blame this on you, Zhang Gong. If it was me, I also wouldn’t have been able to hold back if my beloved has been insulted. We are lucky, though, that you held back at the last moment and didn't kill Hua De. If not, our grudge with Contemplation would have been even worse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill?” I replied with eyes wide open. “I didn’t even think of that before... It is illegal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other four started staring at me with my own expression. It made me feel uneasy. “Why are all of you looking at me like this? Is there something on my face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke replied, “Boss, are you alright? You’re a Magister! Even if you were to kill someone, it won’t matter as Magisters have a count’s privilege. Say, if you were to kill Hua De, or even that vice Principal, the Kingdom won’t punish you at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stared at Ma Ke for what seemed to be ages. “This must be why ordinary magicians hate us so much! Nobles! Is being a noble really that good...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi smacked me. “Stop being so melancholic and moody! We are all exhausted. Let’s have an afternoon nap. I am going to sleep already.” Saying that, she gave her body a lazy stretch, then turned around and heading to her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I started following her with a smug grin all over my face. “I’ll help you fix your bed. Hehe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi walked inside her room but stopped me outside her room. “Don’t look so smug! You think I don’t know about your perverted mind? You want to take advantage of me? No way!” After shouting at me, she pushed me farther away from the room and prevented me from entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I helplessly walked back to the lounge. When they saw my discomposure, they laughed, and even the usually quiet Hai Yue grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Si Wa said, “Zhang Gong, you were met with a closed door, right? Where is the light blade that you cast before? Just destroy that door! </span><i><span style>Haha</span></i><span style>!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I glared at him. “I don’t dare. If you dare to, then you can go try. I’m scared of her... I’m doomed for the rest of my life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Si Wa said, “I dare even less than you do, and I’m not taking that chance either. If I really entered her room after breaking down the door, I would definitely be hacked to death by you.”</span></p>
