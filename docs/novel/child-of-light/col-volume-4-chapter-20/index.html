 <p><i><span style>‘This is bad! The old man noticed me.’ </span></i><span style>He grinned and walked directly towards me. Mu Zi was so frightened she didn’t dare look up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘If I get caught by him, I’ll be in great trouble! What should I do? It’s too late to hide the notes. Since I’m dead already, I’ll use my ultimate move!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I calmly sat upright and looked at the teacher. I placed the slip of paper in front of my nose and blew my nose really hard, which resulted to the paper to land into a corner of the classroom. The teacher glared at me, but didn’t dare to pick up the evidence that I was cheating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just turned around and walked away. I let out a long breath and thought. ‘<em>T</em></span><i><span style>hat was extremely close !’</span></i><span style> Mu Zi who was sitting beside me giggled uncontrollably as she laid her upper body on the table. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I whispered, “Make sure you don’t get saliva on your paper.” Mu Zi then forced herself to stop laughing. She raised her head to continue answering the test questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at my paper. Since I’d copied quickly, I’d answered seventy percent of the questions. I would at least pass. I absent-mindedly answered the rest of the questions, then leaned back in my chair and waited for the papers to be collected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lesson finally ended. After the test papers were collected, I happily said to Mu Zi, “There should be no problem this time. Haha. Thank you so much for your help. How about I treat you to lunch today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi replied, “Your reaction earlier was really fast. The teacher should be terribly angry with you this time. He obviously knows that you were cheating, but can’t get the evidence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I complacently smiled and said, “Of course! I am a counter expert! Are you or are you not going to have lunch with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi thought for a moment. A hint of cunningness flashed through her eyes. “Alright! However, I don’t want to eat at the academy’s canteen. I want to leave the academy to eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I generously said, “No problem! You can pick where to eat. After classes today, let’s go and eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi said, “You’re the one who said that! You’ll need to bring lots of money as I can consume lots of food.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Can your ability to eat even compare to mine? I am the famous White Rice Bucket. Heh heh. I want to see who will win.' &nbsp;</span></i><span style>I couldn’t possibly tell her that, instead</span><span style>&nbsp;I said, “Relax! I promise I’ll let you eat until you’re satisfied.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi smiled. “Great! It’s been some time since I last had a good meal. I want to eat a lot of delicious food.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This was the first time the morning lessons have ended without her being furious with me.</span></i><span style>’ After school, I followed her out of the academy. I followed for a long time, but we still hadn’t reached the destination. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I curiously asked, “Hey little missy, where are you bringing me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi mysteriously smiled at me. “What? Are you scared that I’ll kill you for your money? You were the one who said you wanted to treat me to a meal so stop asking so many questions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hurriedly said, “Alright! I’ll just follow you.” I’m a Magister! I fear no one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>We reached the destination, but it couldn’t be a restaurant! Mu Zi had brought me to a place filled with gold and jade splendor. It really looked as if it could even be compared to a palace, although I had never entered a palace before. The title of the place was, in huge golden words, Ascending Jade Tide. The maître d’hôtel at the entrance came and greeted us. “Mister and young lady, are you here for a meal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi nodded her head. “We want a quiet table for two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maître d’hôtel smiled and replied, “Understood. Welcome to the restaurant!” The service was excellent . That, however, made it a costly establishment . We followed the maître d’hôtel and entered the Ascending Jade Tide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow~ The inside was even more luxurious. On the floor was a famous and valuable carpet, and gold and jade ornaments were everywhere. The maître d’hôtel brought us to a window seat on the second floor and even helped pull the chairs back for us to sit. “Please wait a moment. A waitress will come to take your orders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, in a moment, a young and beautiful waitress came and gave me a menu. To show the elegant demeanor of a gentlemen, I didn’t even look at the menu and gave it to Mu Zi, gesturing for her to go for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi wasn’t modest and took the menu from me. She turned to the first page and skimmed through it, and then looked at the second page. After looking, she returned the menu to the waitress. “I want a set of all of the dishes on the first two pages of the menu and a liter of Ascending Jade Tide.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waitress looked shocked as she stared at Mu Zi. “So much? Can you two even finish all of them? We do not allow withdrawal of any orders in this restaurant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi frowned. “You just need to serve us the dishes. How could you know that we can’t finish them?” The waitress agreed and withdrew with the menu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, “What is Ascending Jade Tide? Isn’t that the restaurant's name?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi replied,”You don’t know? Ascending Jade Tide is an extremely famous beverage. The restaurant became famous due to that beverage so the boss of the restaurant also changed the name of the restaurant to be Ascending Jade Tide. </span></p>
 <p><span style>So it was like that. “You seem to be familiar with this place. Do you come here often?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi replied, “That’s right. I often came here to eat, but I used up all of the money that I had brought from home. I had no choice but to eat at the academy’s canteen.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, astonished, “You love the food here so much that you spent all of your money on it?” Even though I love to eat, it’s not to her extent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi bashfully smiled. “That’s right. I take great pleasure in eating, especially your human race’s food. It’s amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our human race? You aren’t human!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi looked as if she had divulged something and mockingly scolded, “You’re the one that isn’t human! Since we’re already here for the meal, why are you asking so many questions? You don’t feel like paying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I immediately surrendered. “Ok! Ok! I’ll just stop asking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dishes came. </span><span style>I then knew why the waitress was afraid that we wouldn’t be able to finish the meal previously. Mu Zi had ordered so much it couldn’t fit on one table. Another server pulled over another table and filled half of the other table with dishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked in shock, “So many dishes? It’s bad to waste food!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi pouted. “Who said we’ll waste food? Quickly eat! If the food becomes cold, it won’t taste good.” As she said that, she started to eat some prawns with her chopsticks. She ate it with relish. “Yummy! It’s been a long time since I last ate here. This’s just too wonderful.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Since I was the one paying, it wouldn’t be worth it if I didn’t eat any.’ </span></i><span style>I picked up the jade green&nbsp;colored Ascending Jade Tide and had a sip. It gave me a really fresh and cooling feeling. The cold juice instantly permeated my entire body.</span><span style>&nbsp;It felt a little cold and sweet. It was pretty good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>I said, “I’ll eat as well.” I started to bury myself in my food. The dishes looked, smelled and tasted almost perfect. When I was eating, I even almost swallowed my tongue together with the food. </span><span style>It was just too delicious. Mu Zi really knew how to pick a place.</span><i></i><span style>The dishes in front of us were rapidly being wiped out.</span></p>
