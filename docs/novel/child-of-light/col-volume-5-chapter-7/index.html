 <p><span style>Hai Yue wanted to speak privately with me? What is she going to say to me? I looked curiously at Mu Zi. She nodded. Hai Yue and I slowed down until we were behind the rest. After Hai Yue saw that there was some distance between us and them, she said, “Zhang Gong, I want to apologize to you. Previously, I have wronged you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt flattered. Hai Yue had just apologized to me, I didn’t hear it wrongly, right? I said awkwardly, “You don’t have to be so courteous. Actually, there were also many areas where I was in the wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hai Yue turned around and had her back facing me. “After traveling with all of you these past few days, I already feel much better. I know now, that you’ve always been a good person. I had been blinded by anxiousness and hatred previously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, “Did you call me out just to apologize to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hai Yue nodded. I couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. I thought that she was going to ask about Ma Ke. Could it be that it really was impossible for them to be together?</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked her, “Is there really no chance of you and Ma Ke being together? Ma Ke is really not bad. Why won’t you give him a chance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hai Yue turned her head back and smiled at me. “Mu Zi has also asked me that question. Let’s just leave it up to fate. Let’s go! What I said to you just now definitely cannot be told to him.” I was elated. ‘</span><i><span style>It seems that Ma Ke had finally moved Hai Yue, the towering iceberg. I am really happy for that brat.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I purposely asked, “Who is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hai Yue’s face reddened. “You’re hateful! Stop acting dumb!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I smiled and said, “It has been such a long time since I have seen you smile truthfully.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hai Yue replied, “You’re always smiling so mischievously. I really don’t know what my sister and Mu Zi like about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I smiled, “You won’t know about this, but I have a lot of good points. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Mu Zi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hai Yue changed back her expression. “Staying on this topic, let me ask you. What are your plans in settling your relationships with Mu Zi and my sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sighed. “Hai Shui is a good girl, but I can’t be with her as I had already given my heart to Mu Zi. I had also clarified this with Hai Shui already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hai Yue replied, “Matters concerning emotions truly are unclear. Hai Shui is stronger than Mu Zi in all aspects, but you still stubbornly choose her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we not talk about this? All I can tell you is that my feelings for Mu Zi won’t change in my lifetime.” After saying that, I used short distance teleportation to chase up to the group. Hai Yue shook her head and ran to catch up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I abided to the promise with Hai Yue and didn’t say a word of what we spoke about to Ma Ke. Mu Zi looked as though nothing happened. I pulled her aside and asked her, “Why aren’t you asking me about what Hai Yue and I had talked about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi held my hand and whispered, “I believe in you!” Her words made me feel a warm current in my heart. I held her hand up to my lips and kissed it deeply. “You’re so awesome, my wife!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Zi pushed my hand away and said, “You’re annoying. Let’s go! We are reaching the Martial Return City!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Martial Return City wasn’t big and was smaller than expected. Once I entered the city, I stopped a passerby. “Can you please tell me where the Forest Dragon Magic Academy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The random person showed a stupefied expression. “You must be an outsider. Don’t you know that this entire city is the surrounding perimeter of the Forest Dragon Magic Academy?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Ah! This entire city is the academy’s outerior? It can see how high the prestige of the academy is.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I smiled in return. “Can you please tell me where the center of the Forest Dragon Magic Academy is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The passerby pointed in a direction. “You must be here for the examination. There is still quite a way before you reach the enrollment area. You just have to walk straight down this path. You will be able to find the center of the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I told everyone after the passerby left, “It seems that the power that the Forest Dragon Magic Academy holds is not small.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Ke replied, “Of course! The Forest Dragon Magic Academy is an Advanced Magic Academy that is only second to our Royal Advanced Magic Academy. They are also our strongest opponent.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>We reached the entrance of the Forest Dragon Magic Academy, and although the building wasn’t as luxurious as the Royal Advanced Magic Academy, it still gave off a heavy atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I walked up to the guard at the entrance. “Hello, we are from the Royal Advanced Magic Academy. Can I ask……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hadn’t finished what I wanted to say as I was interrupted by the guard. He shouted, “Ah! You are from the Royal Advanced Magic Academy. Please come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard brought us into the Forest Dragon Magic Academy. The academy’s verdant and lush trees and numerous flowers all around us was really pleasing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He brought us to a big building and said, “Please wait a moment. I will go and announce your arrival.” After he said that, he ran into the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, a few people walked out with the guard. I stared at the three other people who walked out. They were all around fifty years old. They showed what kind of magic they used by wearing the fire, water and wind magic robes respectively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one wearing the fire magic robe walked up to us. “Welcome to our Forest Dragon Magic Academy. I am the vice Principal. Please come inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were so polite, we definitely couldn’t forget our manners. We bowed simultaneously. “Our greetings to the teachers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vice Principal nodded before bringing us into the academy. As we walked, he said, “This is our academy’s main school building. You must be ridiculing us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Si Wa Ming said, “This place is very good and isn’t any worse than our academy’s. Vice Principal, do you recognize me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vice Principal looked at him and his expression suddenly changed. He was startled and replied, “Ah! Aren’t you the one that represented the Royal Advanced Magic Academy at the previous competition, Si Wa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Si Wa smiled. “That’s me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vice Principal muttered, “Why have you not graduated yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was a year two student when I came here previously. I am now in year 5 and will be graduating soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>We had reached the vice Principal’s office at that moment. He led us to sit at the sofa. “I represent the Forest Dragon Academy to welcome you all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I smiled and said, “You’re too courteous. I hope that your team will have mercy against us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vice Principal looked at me and said, “It should be you who should be merciful. That’s right! According to the procedure, can you let me have a look at the introduction letter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I gave the vice Principal the introduction letter that Teacher Zhen had passed to me. </span></p>
