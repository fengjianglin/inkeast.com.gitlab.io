 <p><b><u>Volume 12: Chapter 27 - Death Match</u></b></p>
 <p><span style>The expression of the Monster changed constantly from elation and sinister and back before saying, “Brat, if you stop hindering me from eliminating all of the life forms, once I’ve succeeded, I’m willing to equally share all of my power over the continent with you. How about that?” The Monster King seemed to be a little frightened against me that had death as my mind set. Was he fearful of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling the powers that were surging out from my body, I asked indifferently, “Equally share all of your powers over the continent with me? Is that right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monster King nodded. “That’s correct, if you’re willing to stand on my side, I won’t attack you and after I get hold of this place, I’m willing to equally share all of my power over the continent with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I laughed. “What could power amount to? Do you really think I care about them? If I liked power, I wouldn’t be standing here today.” Upon saying that, I brandished my hand and a fissure appeared in the sky. Under my control, five power balls flew out from my space picket. The five surrounding divine instruments seemed to be shivering in excitement as they tried to break free from my power’s restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I took in a deep breath and used the powers inside my body to protect my inner organs. I abruptly remove all of the restrictions on the divine instruments before shouting, “</span><i><span style>War God, Sky God, Titan God, Lightning God and wind God fuse together! Divine powers</span></i><span style>!” I forcefully suppressed five of the divine instruments into my body with the power of the Holy Sword while I chanted. The five light orbs also mixed with the War God, Sky God, Titan God, Lightning God and Wind God powers, and instantly fused with my body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monster King finally understood what I planned to do as he shouted, </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!!!!” He abruptly charged towards me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The multi-coloured light ray emitted from my body, momentarily filling the heaven and earth with its light. The tyrannical power of the Monster king had unexpectedly been rebounded back so he could just stunningly looked at me, who was drastically gaining powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I actually didn’t know what would happen from fusing all five divine instruments. All I thought was how to eliminate the Monster King. When the five divine wills fused into my body, my body seemed to be going to explode as intense heart piercing pain was felt in the next instant. If it wasn’t for Mi Jia Lie modifying my body, I would have exploded at this moment. I hollered in pain, “Ah!!!” The Ice God’s mask transmitted his ice powers to sustain my consciousness at an appropriate moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Six different divine powers constantly conflicted in my body. Even though the Radiant God’s power was the strongest, it still couldn’t suppress the five divine powers in my body. Thin blood rain mist was emitted from all of my body’s hair pores. Tremendous pain constantly filled my body. If it wasn’t for the magnanimous powers that I possessed from burning my life force, I would have already been torn apart by the tyrannical powers inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monster King looked, stunned at me. “Insane! That brat has gone nuts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at the Monster King with bloodshot eyes. Different coloured lightning bolts were constantly being shot out from my body. Enormous power could be felt in my surroundings. I withdrew the Holy Sword’s power into my body to forcefully suppressed the tyrannical divine powers in my body as I raised my head to chant furiously, “</span><i><span style>The God King bestowed upon me the War God’s armor. No evil shall pass me for I shall obstruct the evil demons.</span></i><span style>” Following my chant, the War God’s armour that had formed into a blue power in my body seemed to have found an outlet. The blue light ray abruptly shot out from my body. Big Brother Zhan Hu’s armour appeared on my body. When the armour was donned on my body, I felt that the frantic powers in my body calmed down slightly, making me feel much more comfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monster King retreated backwards and was sneakily headed towards the gulf. It seemed that he already had the mindset of retreating against the berserk me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Want to escape from me?” I aligned my palms together and the light in my surrounding abruptly intensified. An enormous boundary enclosing me and the Monster King within appeared. The Monster King struck against the boundary full on. It momentarily jolted the powers in my body. The intense pain made me to cough out another mouthful of blood. I needed to release all of the rampant powers in my body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>The God King bestowed upon me the Sky God’s horn. My horn’s roar will pierce through the nine heavens.</span></i><span style>” A white light flashed and the Sky God’s horn emerged from my body and hovered at the left side of my body. I took in another deep breath to calm the rampant powers in my body. I took the time where the Monster King hadn’t snapped out of his shock to chant loudly, “</span><i><span style>The God King bestowed upon me the Titan God’s hammer. I will shake the heavens and move the earth to protect the righteous path. The God King bestowed upon me the Lightning God’s shield. Even ten thousand blades shall not stop me.The God King bestowed upon me the Wind God’s bow. My ethereal arrows will flash rapidly and violently.</span></i><span style>” The Titan God’s hammer, Lightning God’s shield, and the Wind’s God bow consecutively appeared in my surroundings after I chanted. Even though the five powers of the respective divine wills still filled my body, after the divine instruments had been summoned by my chant, the Holy Sword and Radiant God’s power suppressed the five divine wills, temporarily returning the calmness of my body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monster King, I’ll represent the God King to eliminate you today. The God King bestowed upon me the Radiant Holy Sword. It shall shine with the soaring radiance of the vault of the heavens.” A silver power appeared before me, instantly forming the Holy Sword’s shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monster King suddenly calmed down. He seemed to have discovered a way to deal with me. He sealed his palms before his chest and closed his eyes. Hai Shui’s goddess like body hovered in mid air before he chanted, “</span><i><span style>Endless death and grudges, follow my command as the Monster race’s King that governs the heaven and earth, monsters that could annihilate everything appear and use your boundless grudges to eliminate all life forms before you to spread the death aura of my Monster race throughout the world! Burst forth the monstrous power to engulf everything-----The Monster King’s summoning!!!</span></i><span style>” Following his chant, the gray aura beside the Monster King’s body constantly formed into monster’s shapes before gradually entering his body. The gray aura from his body gave off a terrifying deathly aura that seemed to be continuously fusing with the Monster King’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wasn’t in the slightest bit affected by the Monster King’s appearance. I loudly chanted, “</span><i><span style>I represent the War God, Sky God, Titan God, Lightning God, Wind God, and Radiant God! Great God King, please bestow me your unlimited divine power to enable me to fuse all of the divine powers as one, in order to uphold justice in the world, to eliminate all sinister beings to return peace and harmony to the world------Forbidden Symphony of the Gods’ Awakening!” </span></i><span style>Six divine phantoms appeared at my back. They slowly combined themselves. After constant infusion, my sight suddenly became white. The six divine phantoms fused together to have enormous blue, white, yellow, red, green and gold light pillars that soared towards the sky. The six divine powers that filled my entire body was constantly being absorbed by the light pillar that extended towards the sky. At this conjuncture, I unexpectedly was in exceptional comfort.</span></p>
