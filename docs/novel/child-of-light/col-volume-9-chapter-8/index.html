 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Volume 9: Chapter&nbsp;8 - Six Tailed Demon Fox</b></span></p>
 <p><span style>Since we planned to head into the mountain forest, before we entered the mountain, we already dealt with our horses beforehand. I didn’t know that they would unexpectedly cost so much. The boss also said that our horses were rare. He said that he would want all of the horse we had. If I knew about this earlier, I wouldn’t have released those few horses earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As we walked up the winding mountain tracks, I told Su He, “According to the map, if we cross this mountain, we should be able to shorten quite a bit of the journey towards the capital city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He nodded. “That’s right, it shortens the journey by about three days. However, people rarely use this route as the mountain tracks are difficult to trek on, and they may encounter powerful demon beasts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I nodded, “Anyways, if you lead us down the wrong path, I’ll feed you to the demon beast. Hehe! It’s all up to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He replied with bitter smiles, “Boss, I know already and stop scaring me. I’m going to have a heart attack at this rate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I coldly snorted and said, “Stop acting. Hmm…..”As I was saying that, I suddenly saw Su He’s eyes was glittering with radiance while he drooled uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at where he was looking at and saw a beautiful girl from the demon race heading towards us. </span></p>
 <p><span style>I slapped Su He, making him come back to reality. ‘Ai ya!’ He looked at me fumingly and said, “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I raised my head and replied, “What are you looking at? When you’re with us, control yourself. If you cause trouble, you will have something fun to look forward to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He showed a defiant expression, believing himself to be wronged. “All gentlemen seek graceful, wise and virtuous women. That lady’s figure was really good. All the proportion of her body are perfect. Wow, that’s awesome. If she were to be in….. Ai yo! Why did you hit me again?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>I said, “That blow was only a light one. You’re to lower your head for me and you will be forbidden from looking at that young lady again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under my pressure, Su He lowered his head, at the same time that girl from the demon race was already near us. That demoness was more graceful than any of the human race’s girls. We all followed Su He’s footsteps as when we looked, we were dazzled by her as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though that girl from the demon race wasn’t as pretty as Mu Zi, her charms were able to seduce everyone, especially with her bountiful body figure. She walked elegantly towards us. Her every gesture was extremely enticing as her hips and breasts made us have indescribable, wild and fanciful thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had already walked past us, but our gazes were unable to move away from her. That girl looked back and giggled, momentarily making arousing our three immortal souls and seven mortal forms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, I felt a sudden pain at my thigh. I didn’t know what had pierced me. When my mind cleared, I was immediately startled. With my cultivation, why was I so captivated by her. Not good, I shouted, “Everyone, be wary. She’s a demoness.” My voice, coated with magic power, woke everyone up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Hu wiped the perspiration off his head and muttered, “So powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an astonished expression in her eyes as she looked at me in shock. “I never thought that there was someone that could get back to their senses after seeing my impeccable and beautiful good looks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I silently circulated the Holy Sword’s power. The heavenly light momentarily gathered at my chest. The charm from that demoness wouldn’t be able to invade me again. I shouted, “You’re good, demoness. Why did you try to charm us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That girl chuckled. “I’m hungry, that’s why.” Her voice was so gentle and a strong enticing force came towards after that. I coldly snorted before I shot a halo fused with magic and the Holy Sword’s power towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl was frightened and didn’t continue to use her charm, instead she shot out a black light to try to block my attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Holy Sword’s power and light magic possessed attributes that restrained black magic so her counter attack definitely wouldn’t work. The halo successfully dispersed her magic and tightly locked around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As that girl was trying to withstand the light halo with all her might, she cried out in fright, “The human race’s light magic? You’re not from the demon race?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My expression changed before I said, “Since you know our secret, do you think we’ll let you go?” I walked towards her with a cold expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had already awoken from their stunned state and were exceptionally shocked. Even with their high cultivation, they were almost killed by that girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light halo continuously tightened. The girl cried out mournfully before her body gradually started to transform. Under everyone’s amazement, she slowly turned into a fox-like demon beast but with six tails.</span><span style>Su He exclaimed in fright, “An evolutionary demon fox?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, “Is she a demon beast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He nodded. “She won’t be able to take it any longer. Can you relax your attack a little?” The light halo stopped constricting around her and stayed at its original state at my will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He said, “Demon beasts that can evolve are really rare. I didn’t expect to find one here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, “Is there a difference between an evolving demonic beast and the evolving magical beasts of human mages?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He shook his head. “There’s a difference. The evolving demon beast’s most terrifying component is that as it evolves, its intelligence increases, especially demon foxes that are the most crafty. She looks to have evolved to have six tails so she should be a B ranked demon beast. But she has intelligence surpassing that of a B ranked demon beast. If she were to evolve to have nine tails, she’d be an A ranked demon fox. She wouldn’t be easy to deal with then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I nodded. “What kind of offensive attacks does this demon fox specialize in?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He explained, “She doesn’t have any special offensive ability. There are thorns at the tip of her tail that contains strong poison, but it isn’t deadly, and only has a numbing effect. Her most special characteristic is that she can turn into any life forms and imitate various voices. Previously, she should have transformed into one of the beauties of our demon race. If we were seduced by her, once we were pieced by the poisonous thorns, we’d be drained of our blood, resulting in our death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I frowned and said, “It’s that vicious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su He replied, “I’m also curious as to why there’s such a demon beast here. Only other life forms’ blood essence can make them evolve. They should already be extinct according to folklore. It was because they were too malicious that they had given rise to the wrath of Heaven. Moreover, there are extremely few demon foxes that can cultivate to her standard. Currently, we only have single tailed demon foxes in our demon beasts that are used for reconnaissance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I walked over to the demon fox and coldly snorted, “Since you’re that malicious, I definitely couldn’t let you go today. If not, I don’t know how many innocent people will die unjustly by your hands.” After I said that, I raised my hand. </span></p>
