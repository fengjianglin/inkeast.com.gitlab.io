 <p><strong><u>Volume 3: Chapter 8 – Encountering Bandits</u></strong></p>
 <p>A short and stout middle aged man walked over, “Hello sir, was it you that wanted to use the amethyst card to pay the bill?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. What’s the matter?” I lazily answered. I’ve eaten my fill, right now my greatest concern was going to bed.</p>
 <p>“May I ask you what your profession is?” The middle aged man asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I am a mage. What does this have to do with the meal? Let me pay the bill immediately, I want to go.”</p>
 <p>“It’s like this, the reason why we are called Signature tavern is because every person that eats here either has great ability or a position in society. So long as you write your signature here, you can eat a meal for free.”</p>
 <p>“So there was such a good thing. Then I’ll give you my autograph.” Eat a meal without paying, not bad.</p>
 <p>“Then what is your mage rank?”</p>
 <p>I took out my magic union identification card, “Great Mage, is this a high enough rank?”</p>
 <p>The shop keeper’s face showed a pleasantly surprised smile, “That is high enough. Without doubt. Then I will inconvenience you.”</p>
 <p>With just a casual signature on the names of four delicious dishes, I was excused from paying for several gold coins worth of food. It seems that the magic identification card has it uses, not bad.</p>
 <p>Later generations testified to the shop owner’s wisdom, for the Child of Light’s autograph was later auctioned off for 20,000 diamond coins.</p>
 <p>I randomly picked a hotel to stay the night. Tomorrow morning, I’ll go to the east city gate. That was where I made an appointment with the strong man yesterday.</p>
 <p>There were a truly great amount of people and great many carriages parked on the roadside. I suppose this is the caravan I’m supposed to escort. Isn’t that the strong man? From a glance, he looked like he was chatting with a few merchants.</p>
 <p>“Hi, I’ve come. When are we leaving?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, you came. Let me introduce you. This is the leader of the caravan we are escorting, Mr. Li Ci Meng.” He said pointing at a stout merchant. “This person is a great mage. Ah that’s right. I still don’t know your name. My name is Long Meng Hai.”</p>
 <p>“My name is Zhang Gong Wei. Greetings everyone, I am honored to be escorting you all with Long Meng.”</p>
 <p>Mr. Meng looked at me be doubt, “You are a great mage?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, what? Not convinced? Oh great light elements, heed my call, friends. Congregate in front of me, become a holy light annihilating everything.” I only displayed my own strength, so that I could take it easy during the journey.</p>
 <p>Following my incantation, my body suddenly dispatched a dazzling white light pushing away everyone within five meters of me.</p>
 <p>“If any of you have the slightest knowledge of magic, you should that was a rank six spell.” My voice transmitted from within the Holy Light.</p>
 <p>My powerful spell caught the interest of everyone present, and they all gasped with surprise. I withdrew my holy light, “With this you should be convinced.”</p>
 <p>As expected of a merchant, Mr. Meng immediately walked over with a smile across his face, “Excuse us, we shouldn’t have doubted you, great mage. With you on this journey, our safety is guaranteed.</p>
 <p>Long Meng also walked over. A moment ago when I released the power of Holy Light, he hadn’t been able to resist even the slightest. He said ashamedly, “To tell the truth, I had also doubted your abilities at the beginning. Now I know how silly I was. In this escort mission, my mercenary company and I have decided to listen to your orders.</p>
 <p>With everyone flattering me, I got a bit carried away. “You don’t have to do that. I just didn’t want everyone to think I was only here for food, hehe. You’ll still be in charge, I don’t want to. If something happens, it will be fine to just call for me.”</p>
 <p>Like that, the journey had started with me and Long Meng’s mercenary company escorting about a hundred merchant carriages.</p>
 <p>Because I had displayed my strength, everyone had treated me with admiration, letting ride in the most luxurious carriage and receiving the best rations during meal time. I also became a freeloader. It seemed that magic was truly not widely learned. Knowing magic had many benefits, not only having to not pay for food at a restaurant but I can also freeload off of the mercenaries, haha.</p>
 <p>My carriage is at the center of the caravan. It is said so that I could look after the entire caravan from front to end. &nbsp;Just when I was about to fall asleep, someone had shook me awake. It was Long Meng. He looked exhausted, his brow beaded with sweat.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter?” I lazily asked.</p>
 <p>“It’s bad. It seems we’ve come across bandits.” Long Meng said nervously.</p>
 <p>“That’s not possible. There are people that dare to rob such a large caravan?” In my mind, I imagined about twenty to thirty bandits.</p>
 <p>“We have a large amount of men? Why don’t you go out and take a look?” Long Meng was clearly a bit nervous.</p>
 <p>It seemed somewhat amiss, I dropped from the carriage, and was stunned by the situation before me. Now I knew why Long Meng had sweated so much, because I had also broke a cold sweat.</p>
 <p>On top of the hills, I saw group of more than three hundred men before me. Such a large bandit group, how did I end up with such terrible luck? I originally believed I could comfortably complete this mission, but it seems this time there’s going to be a bit of trouble.</p>
 <p>Long Meng’s mercenary company and I came together to the front. The bandit group had arrived in front of us in a flash, and scattered in every direction, creating an impenetrable encirclement.</p>
 <p>“Tell your leader to come out and answer.” A bandit arrogantly yelled.</p>
 <p>Long Meng, Mr. Meng, and I all looked at each other, who will go? &nbsp;They suddenly pushed me out. This, this is too unjust! But I already came out. Let’s take a look. Honestly, to run away by myself is unacceptable. It’s possible to flee but I’m not that afraid. I walked forward a few steps.</p>
 <p>“May I ask how we may help all of you gentlemen?” After I asked, the bandits immediately gave an arrogant, heartily laugh.</p>
 <p>“Who do you think we are? &nbsp;Leave all of your belongings behind at once and I, your father, will release you. Or else, hehe.” Their black battle armored boss said loudly.</p>
 <p>“Elder brothers, we all aren’t that easy. Won’t you let us go?” I pleaded.</p>
 <p>“Let you go? We waited a month with great difficulty for an attractive, wealthy target and you want us to let you go? What a delusion.”</p>
 <p>It looks like it’ll be impossible to pass. I was suddenly hit with a bright idea, and recalled what Teacher Di and I had discussed. The people of the Xiuda Kingdom truly value face, especially the pride of a knight. It seemed I can exploit this.</p>
 <p>“Excuse me, you, leader, are you a knight?” My words were hard and firm, piercing through the leader’s black battle armor.</p>
 <p>Before he replied, a bandit viciously said, “Of course. Our boss is a heaven knight.” That leader wore an obviously proud appearance. Not bad, they fell into my trap.</p>
