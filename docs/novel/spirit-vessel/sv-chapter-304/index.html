Pa!” This last disciple couldn’t finish his sentence before being slapped twice by Wan Xiangcen. His body spun several times in the air before falling and rolling on the ground.</span></p>

Some would even kneel on the ground out of fear. On the other hand, despite his injuries, Ji Feng could still look straight at him without arrogance.</span></p>

These words alone were more than enough as one could hear the audible gasps across the field. Even Dashi’s third prince as well as Mu Dantian and Mu Shuidi were surprised. Was there someone this terrifying in the contemporary?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a genius couldn’t possibly be unknown! Waves formed in Princess Luofu’s eyes as well. She stared at the group and wondered if there was someone else with comparable talents to Ji Feng among them.</span></p>

This was the greatest spotlight; several thousand eyes fell onto one person at the same time.</span></p>

Many flowers were blooming on the branches. The wind blew by and red petals fluttered down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The snowflakes glued themselves to the petals before landing on the black armor, broken saber, and iron boots as cold as ice.</span></p>

Was Ji Fent pointing at the wrong person or was he just lying to everyone? How could a Thousand-man Commander defeat seven great geniuses from the heretical schools?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pagoda’s disciples felt a strange sense of disappointment. They thought there was someone who could defeat the heretical schools but felt discouraged after seeing that it was only a Thousand-man Commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Xuezang was able to see a glimmer of extraordinariness in him: “Are you close to the pagoda?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Feiyun’s face was hidden behind a helmet with only a single gap to expose his eyes. He stood among the apricot petals and snowflakes while saying: “I had no relations with the pagoda, but four girls from there have just died in front of me. They were raped by some heretical disciples and no longer wished to live, so they ended their youthful lives. When their blood dyed the white snow red, the scene was even more beautiful than the flowers you see here.” Feng Feiyun’s rough words were uttered in a calm manner, yet everyone could hear the anger in his voice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Feng and the other geniuses from the pagoda turned furious and almost lost their self-control; they wanted to rush over to kill the heretics. Their experience must have been insufferable to drive them to suicide despite having the strong willpower of cultivators. No one could stay calm at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued on: “A life for a life. The heretical schools have no respect for the laws so others might not dare to oppose them, but I’m not afraid in the slightest. I shall bury forty heads from the heretics with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This voice was as sonorous as the thunder in the billowing clouds. It shocked the air and caused ears to ring. The ten cultivators nearest to him were directly blown away by the blast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Feiyun didn’t want others to recognize him, so his voice was quite rugged like an old veteran on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the disciples stared at the man in the black armor while completely stunned!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The oldest son of the Tiger Marquis suddenly stood up and asked: “The martial army actually has a real man like this. Brother, which marquis are you under?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt that this Thousand-man Commander was exceedingly heroic, so he wanted to recruit him for his father. Being only a Thousand-man Commander was simply an injustice to this fella.</span></p>

Young Marquis, I’m just a rough loser, so you can call me by my name, Feng Daniu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Daniu! A defeated soldier? Everyone understood right away. It must have been the earth-shattering war not long ago. Three marquises and a hundred million strong army were defeated by the corpses. Their remains were scattered across three thousand miles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a stirring and tragic battle. If it wasn’t for the Evil Woman being too strong and killing the Omni-Heaven Marquis as well as crippling the Heaven Shaking Marquis, the martial army wouldn’t have lost so miserably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps forty million troops have died. The rest were separated and retreated to the Grand Southern Prefecture. Some of these remnant branches were still fighting the corpses even now. This Thousand-man Commander must be one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Young Marquis laughed and said: “If you aren’t a disciple from the pagoda, then it isn’t your turn for revenge. Leave it to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s right. This is our pagoda’s vengeance so we should be the ones to dish it out. Even if I, Mu Dantian, have to die, I will still take some of them down with me. Count me in for two of the forty!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me too, only the blood of the heretics will be able to wash away our shame.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the disciples from the pagoda were stirred with their blood boiling. Some were afraid of the heretical schools, but if even an outsider wasn’t afraid, why should men from the pagoda be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a bunch of trash. The heretical schools have been building themselves up for one thousand years just to emerge once more to reign over the world. Even if you all desperately try your best, you won’t be able to change anything!” Xuezang spat out each word like divine swords that could pierce through the world, rendering the entire scene silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More than ten heaven-defying geniuses from the pagoda had their eardrums ruptured with blood oozing out. Three fell head first onto the ground and actually went unconscious.</span></p>

They were slightly pale and their legs were quivering. The wave almost blew them backward.</span></p>

He was truly too strong. Just one sentence was enough to repel more than ten top geniuses of the pagoda, devoiding them of their will to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the face of absolute power, the pagoda’s heroism was suppressed once more. Even if they risked their lives, they wouldn’t be able to hurt Xuezang in the slightest.</span></p>
