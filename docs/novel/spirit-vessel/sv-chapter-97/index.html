 <p>Two Giants joining forces to take down a junior from the younger generation — if this matter were to be spread, then the reputations of the two Giants would be ruined while Feng Feiyun’s reputation would definitely shock the world.</p>
 <p>“It's over. With two Giants taking action together, who here could stop them?”</p>
 <p>Many cultivators were dumbfounded and were greatly surprised by Feng Feiyun’s power. However, when the two Giants were about to fight him at the same time, everyone felt sorry for Feng Feiyun.</p>
 <p>It seemed as if a king of the younger generation will perish today, dying inside the godly temple.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingshui asked:</p>
 <p>“Second Grandpa, do I need to lend him a helping hand?”</p>
 <p>The old man riding on the mountain goat rubbed his nest-like hair and glanced at Dongfang Jingyue, and he smilingly asked:</p>
 <p>“Little Girl, what do you say?”</p>
 <p>Both the old and young man assumed that Dongfang Jingyue was deeply in love with Feng Feiyun. As for them, they also wanted to help Feng Feiyun in order to get a great young talent with boundless potential to join the Yin Gou Clan, but they still wanted to tease Dongfang Jingyue first.</p>
 <p>They were hoping to hear her personally implore them.</p>
 <p>However, they didn’t know that the feelings of Dongfang Jingyue towards Feng Feiyun was rather vague. There were some grievances, as well as an unspeakable appreciation for his talents, but for a woman as proud as her to ask them for help, this was harder than reaching the heavens.</p>
 <p>No matter the kind of women, in the beginning, they were all very shy!</p>
 <p>If a woman’s skin has thickened, then they must have encountered a man with thick-skin as well. This type of shamelessness could only be learned and incorporated into one’s natural demeanor or sheer pretense!</p>
 <p>However, our fourth Young Miss Dongfang is still only a young girl. She had only just come out from the Godly Dragon Palace on top of the Heavenly Mountain to the real world. Her skin was still very thin. Even if she truly liked someone, she wouldn’t be able to say it out loud — this would be too embarrassing, ah!</p>
 <p>“Let him die! He’s just a son of the Evil Demon, our Yin Gou Clan does not need to offend so many cultivators just for him.”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue continued:</p>
 <p>“And I hate him to the bones. It is better if he dies, so I don’t have to kill him myself.”</p>
 <p>“Are you sure you won’t commit suicide out of love because of him?”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingshui asked.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue glared at him, and she coldly responded:</p>
 <p>“I would only see it as a stray dog dying. The most I will do is digging a grave and bury him.”</p>
 <p>“Aish! A woman has to go and pick up her man’s corpse, this is the 'Husband Burial'… Cough cough, no, no! Burying a stray dog, burying a stray dog, a really big stray dog.”</p>
 <p>Second Grandpa changed his tone. He just wanted to ridicule Dongfang Jingyue.</p>
 <p>The truth was that they both knew Dongfang Jingyue was just being shy and refused to say it. She actually didn’t want Feng Feiyun to die in this place. Therefore, when it was necessary, they would still take action. If not for Dongfang Jingyue, then it would be for the Yin Gou Clan to recruit a young genius with boundless potential.</p>
 <p>“Boom, Boom, Boom!”</p>
 <p>Both the Feng ancestor and Huo Tuotuo had Spirit Treasures. The Jin River Copper Cauldron and Evil Fire Body both launched their attacks. Feng Feiyun eventually couldn’t block them, and he was filled with wounds. One of his ribs was broken by the cauldron. If the Spirit Vessel inside his body didn’t counter the cauldron, then it would have pierced through his body.</p>
 <p>“Poof!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was punched by the Evil Fire Body in the back. His spine issued a crackling sound, and his whole body was almost torn into two pieces.</p>
 <p>Two Giants with two Spirit Treasures wasn’t something that the current Feng Feiyun could oppose. However, he didn’t take even half a step back. He was still persistent and didn’t want them to distract Nalan Xuejian from suppressing the female corpse.</p>
 <p>If Feng Feiyun wanted to leave, these people wouldn’t necessarily be able to stop him. However, he was unable to walk away. At the very least, he had to wait for Nalan Xuejian and bring her along.</p>
 <p>Even though his whole body was wounded, he was still persisting through it all, waiting, and waiting!</p>
 <p>The hour was approaching and the power of the ancient pill had weakened, but at this moment, Nalan Xuejian still hadn’t come out from the light.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue naturally saw through what Feng Feiyun was doing. With his current power, he could easily break through the siege and escape, but he was still protecting the yellow ancient well. What else could he be doing but waiting for that girl inside the light?</p>
 <p>Serves you right, you deserve to die. I will just bury a stray dog after this!</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue seemed to be acting at her leisure as if she didn’t care. Yet, her fingers were gripping her sleeves tightly. It was just as Feng Feiyun had said:</p>
 <p>“This damned Dongfang Jingyue is too narrow-minded and petty.”</p>
 <p>*** ***</p>
 <p>Within the light, Nalan Xuejian was standing next to the yellow ancient well and observed the female corpse on top of it. At such a close distance, she noticed that this female corpse was indeed quite beautiful. She had a slender face, a sharp chin, and a straight nose.</p>
 <p>Her figure particularly aroused the jealousy of other women. Those two slender legs went a bit too far. Nalan Xuejian considered that she had a great figure herself, but compared to the female corpse, her legs were a bit short.</p>
 <p>When she controlled the Nine Layers Lotus Formation to fly next to the female corpse, she realized that her figure was so ordinary. Her legs were not as long and straight, and her waist was not as slim. Even her white breasts were lacking a whole chunk in comparison.</p>
 <p>Nalan Xuejian became even angrier. Why was it that nothing was comparable to her? Was this woman an alluring succubus?</p>
 <p>Suppress, definitely must suppress her!</p>
 <p>Absolutely cannot let her revive!</p>
 <p>Nalan Xuejian took out the Buddhist Jade Bead. It was blindingly dazzling and emitted a gentle green light. Buddhist auras permeated from the nine holes.</p>
 <p>She wanted to activate it and completely obliterate the life essence inside the body of Xiao Nuolan, but suddenly, her whole body started shaking. As she was holding up the Buddhist Jade Bead and staring at the female corpse, the female corpse’s originally closed eyes, like a sleeping beauty, suddenly opened. The pupils in her eyes were crimson like an ocean of blood — extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>Nefarious! Terrorizing! Sinister!</p>
 <p>The female corpse that had died for more than one thousand years and the supreme beauty of her generation renowned throughout the world had opened her eyes at this very moment.</p>
 <p>Her originally black pupils that opened again after eighteen hundred years had turned crimson. They were no longer pure and their spiritual consciousness was gone. The only things left were mysteriousness and killing intent.</p>
 <p>Nalan Xuejian held the Buddhist Jade Bead and was completely motionless. She covered her mouth with her hands and held her breath; she was completely speechless. She firmly bit her lips and thought:</p>
 <p>“Oh heavens! Even her eyes are prettier compared to mine!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Nuolan’s hand reached out and directly gripped Nalan Xuejian's neck. Her crimson bloody eyes were no longer beautiful and, instead, were frightening and ferocious!</p>
 <p>*** ***</p>
 <p>The one hour limit was inching closer and closer and the wounds on Feng Feiyun’s body were getting deeper and deeper, but Nalan Xuejian had not left the light. Could it be that something terrible had happened to her?</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun couldn’t wait any longer. He recalled the Infinite Spirit Ring and then, using his Invincible Buddhist Staff, he engraved the ground with a Six Layers Lotus Formation. He intended to personally enter the light and bring Nalan Xuejian out. Even if they couldn’t suppress Xiao Nuolan, it was now the time to leave.</p>
 <p>The power of the Six Layers Lotus Formation originally couldn’t get through the light of the ancient formation. However, just a moment ago, the power of the light suddenly decreased. Feng Feiyun seized this opportunity to directly rush into the light.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>At this final moment, Huo Tuotuo unleashed a palm that flew forward, but it didn’t hit Feng Feiyun. Instead, it collided with the light.</p>
 <p>“This brat actually broke into the light!”</p>
 <p>The Feng ancestor wanted to follow as well, but he was repelled by the power of the light and was knocked flying away.</p>
 <p>At this second, the power of the light increased, and the entire yellow ancient well began to shake violently. A fierce light penetrated the high heavens and knocked the six Giants away.</p>
 <p>"Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!"</p>
 <p>The six Giants were knocked away like pins, rolling on the ground and creating six human-shaped holes. They absolutely couldn’t have blocked that power from earlier.</p>
 <p>What the hell was going on?</p>
 <p>The day suddenly turned into night and the sun was replaced by the stars and the moon. The changing of celestials was a presage of the earth-shattering event that would soon take place.</p>
 <p>This will not be an ordinary day; many extraordinary things happened one after another!</p>
