Two grand achievement God Bases from the Third Hall attacked. Both were quite amazing. One had opened 210 meridians while the other 230.</span></p>

They had narrow cheeks, their brows were arched upward, and their eyes were as narrow as a blackfish.</span></p>

Their bodies almost merged with their spears; they resembled two long ridges.</span></p>

However, they didn’t even have time to voice their displeasure before the sound of flesh exploding came about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spears had been split by the power of the heavenly gaze. Their bodies were pierced and fell down from the sky. Once they made contact with the ground, only two stained robes were left.</span></p>

Before one knew it, three top experts from the Third Hall had been slain on the spot.</span></p>

He had regained some momentum for the pagoda!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This youth’s figure was carved into the minds of the heretical disciples in an indelible manner.</span></p>

The Pure Eight Arrays Formation and the Full Moon Heavenly Gaze are what you rely on the most. Others can’t stop these two techniques, but I can and will take you down within fifty moves!” Liu Chengfeng took out an astronomy chart, making it seem as if he was holding a starry sky. He had just come up with a method to break Ji Feng’s techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the number one genius of the Third Hall, he was only weaker than the Third Lord, so he was quite confident. He once killed a grand achievement God Base when he was only at the middle level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words made many heretics quite excited. If he said fifty moves, then he would certainly not have to use the fifty-first.</span></p>

It didn’t look like a human eye, it was more like a round moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A divine ray that resembled a white-jade sword more than twenty meters long flew out. It pierced through the Boundless Palm Mountain and aimed for Chengfeng’s neck.</span></p>

The attack earlier almost severed Chengfeng’s neck. He touched his neck with one finger and snorted. A heart-shaped piece of iron flew out of his heart and turned into a thick, ancient shield. It danced around his body before striding towards Ji Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” This shield had its own spirit. No one knows what treasure was used to create it, but it was able to stop the attack from the heavenly gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your gaze might be strong, but my Black Tortoise Origin can still stop it…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” After he finished speaking, the shield was penetrated by the heavenly gaze and made a crack in the center. Even this shield failed to stop Ji Feng’s offense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, Chengfeng used this chance to get closer to Ji Feng. From the previous exchanges, Chengfeng was able to observe from afar that Ji Feng’s technique and dao laws were quite powerful. His long-range capability was unbeatable at the same level, but as long as Chengfeng could get within ten steps of him and resort to close combat, how could Ji Feng stop him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He unleashed a fist of eight qilins. A power of 1,280,000 pounds rushed out and made Ji Feng take three steps back, resulting in three huge holes on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, Ji Feng was not used to close combat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chengfeng’s figure shifted into shadows and surrounded Ji Feng while he constantly sent out attacks of eight qilins. This was a confrontation of pure power. There were qilin shadows everywhere in the air as if they had come to an ancient battlefield waging war for several days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chengfeng was indeed the top genius of the heretics. His body was very powerful as energy surged through him without depleting. He completely suppressed Ji Feng into a passive state where he couldn’t even use his techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A power of eight qilins could destroy mountains and split the earth. An ordinary grand achievement God Base would be exhausted after just one strike of this magnitude, but Chengfeng unleashed seventy-two in a row and Ji Feng’s energy was still magnificent like a divine whale roaring in the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">576 qilin shadows surrounded Ji Feng. The area turned into a prison where a primordial beast emerged. This force couldn’t be described with words. Even the heretics were speechless. They didn’t expect Chengfeng to be this powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pluff! Pluff!” The flesh on Ji Feng’s thighs was being smashed apart since it couldn’t withstand this power. It was as if he was being split in two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fifty moves failed to take your life. Ji Feng, you are truly strong, but you shall die by the 73rd move.” Chengfeng slammed down from the sky as his black cloak fluttered like an evil cloud. A palm descended with another eight qilins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not necessarily!” Ji Feng raised both of his hands and spat out blood along with five red jewels that were situated on his spine. They looked just like the legendary gold core. They formed a five corner star that wished to break through the entrapment of the qilins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a Spirit Treasure, the Meteor Fire Jewels! They acted like five hot suns and struck with power like the real deal. The qilin shadows in the sky were shattered. Five golden rays rushed into the air and resembled five towering pillars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd wondered: “Ji Feng actually had a Spirit Treasure in his possession, can he turn the tide with this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thunderous snort came from the horizon. The Third Lord tossed down a black palace straight into Chengfeng’s hand. This was another Spirit Treasure that was used to defeat Shi Yelai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With an equivalent artifact, Chengfeng began to fight against Ji Feng once more for another 270 moves. The two treasures fought until the sky lost its light. Their figures disappeared into the raging battle of these two mighty weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” The palace fell to the ground and drilled thirty meters into the earth. A great amount of debris went flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chengfeng also fell from above and slammed into the ground with his quivering body. He couldn’t stand up at all, so he only stared at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Feng slowly landed. His legs were mangled and gushing out blood. Some areas showed his bones as well, but he still stood proudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite defeating Chengfeng, he had paid a great price. Blood beads were dripping from nearly all of his orifices. One could see just how fierce this battle was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was stunned for a second time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could Chengfeng lose?!” The heretical disciples crazily roared, unable to accept this reality.</span></p>

The pagoda’s ultimate genius had defeated their great genius from the Third Hall of the Senluo Temple. An undefeated legend has been crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heretical schools were not unbeatable!</span></p>

Each of his steps carried a wondrous rhythm. He was clearly walking at a slow pace, but it made people feel that they couldn’t see his figure.</span></p>
