<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The three ancient monk corpses seemed to fear the lake of blood, and they essentially didn’t dare to step in the bloody water. They only waited on the shore, screeching while they spewed black corpse fog nonstop.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun and Dongfang Jingyue quickly swam in the water. Their clothes were dyed red by the bloody water, and their hair was also full of bloody residue; even their skin was covered by a layer of bloody mud.</p>
 <p>After making it to the shore, the two were out of breath, sitting on the ground. Their bodies were wet and without any strength. It was fortunate that the three ancient monk corpses did not come; otherwise, they could only sit and wait for their death.</p>
 <p>“Little Girl Dongfang Jingyue, how did you offend the three ancient monk corpses in the end? Why were they always chasing you down?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun had a difficult time breathing as he asked.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was lying on the floor for a while, but he didn’t hear an answer — could it be that this girl had died?</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s hands struggled to support his body as he got up. He turned his head and saw that Dongfang Jingyue was lying behind him with her eyes closed shut, motionless. It was like she was dead.</p>
 <p>Because she was soaked in the blood water for so long, her clothes were tightly attached to her body, revealing the curvaceous outlines of her body vividly and thoroughly. The white silk robe was also soaked with watery blood; the two twin peaks stood erect, perfectly round and fragrantly voluptuous — truly enough to fill one’s grasp. Not a single trace of excess flesh could be found, and there was also the pair of slender and long legs…</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun quickly turned his head away, afraid that if he kept on staring, then he would commit certain uncontrollable acts.</p>
 <p>This couldn’t go any other way. For a woman like Dongfang Jingyue, any man who saw her couldn’t help but have the impulse to hug her in their arms. Plus, at this moment, she was lying down on the ground motionlessly, as if deliberately waiting for Feng Feiyun to make a move towards her.</p>
 <p>“No wonder she didn’t go crazy when I pulled off her sash. It seems like the corpse poison inside her body had already spread to the God Base in her dantian!”</p>
 <p>Because the sash of Dongfang Jingyue was torn away by Feng Feiyun, her outer robe was loose, revealing her skin below her neck. One could faintly see her slightly purple dudou; it seemed to be sending an alluring fragrance.</p>
 <p>This was absolutely a woman that could bewilder someone to pay with his own life. She could make any man in the world forget his road home because of her.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s gaze was directed towards her neck and chest, and his mind was filled with an internal struggle.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Feng Feiyun was considering one problem. Naturally, it was not to rush over and kiss her, and then force himself on her; it was to save her or to kill her.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue’s neck and chest both have wounds caused by the ancient corpses, and she was invaded by the corpse poison. The wounds were pitch black. When Feiyun used the Heavenly Phoenix Gaze, he could see a faint black mist emitting from the wounds; they were slowly corroding her flesh.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, if Feng Feiyun took action at this moment, he could easily kill her then throw her corpse into the river of blood. Then, he would never need to worry about her killing him in the future as well as the pressure from the Yin Gou family.</p>
 <p>Even the “Haotian Spirit Mirror” spirit treasure would be his!</p>
 <p>If this was the action, it would definitely be lucrative.</p>
 <p>“Dongfang Jingyue, don’t blame me for being too merciless. Just blame your bad luck in meeting I, Feng Feiyun. Today is the day where ‘the sweet fragrance dissipates and the jade is destroyed’.”</p>
 <p>No poison, no great man.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun knew clearly that if he didn’t kill her now, then, when she healed, she would definitely tear him into thousands of pieces.</p>
 <p>This was the best time to take action. After killing her, he would destroy her corpse and the evidence — who would know that Feng Feiyun was the one who killed her?</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun changed his palm into a fist, wanting to smash her head with one blow. The fist’s energy was fierce; it was still three zhang away, but it was enough to cause the stones around her body to shake.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>The wind from the fist energy caused her veil to be blown away, revealing a beauty capable of toppling cities and countries.</p>
 <p>Her eyebrows were long and slender like the willow leafs; her curving eyelashes were still stained with glimmering blood drops; and that pair of lips, they were crafted to the point of perfection. They were just like two thin roses.</p>
 <p>The face beneath the veil was captivatingly suffocating; any description would pale in comparison to her matchless beauty — she was simply one in a million.</p>
 <p>Seeing this face, Feng Feiyun’s whole body quivered as if he was struck by lightning. He originally wanted to kill her with one blow, but now, he suddenly and forcefully withdrew his punch.</p>
 <p>“Poof!”</p>
 <p>The reverse power of the fist caused him to spew out a mouthful of blood!</p>
 <p>“Shui Yueting… No, she is Dongfang Jingyue. No… She is Shui Yueting… She has to be Shui Yueting…”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Feng Feiyun felt an excruciating pain in his chest. With one knee on the ground, his hands tightly clasped his chest and was unable to rise from the ground for a long time.</p>
 <p>The first time Feng Feiyun met Dongfang Jingyue, he mistook her for Shui Yueting; however, that was simply because their presence was too similar. However, who could have expected that under the veil, she was exactly the same as Shui Yueting.</p>
 <p>It was truly the same person!</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s heart regarded Shui Yueting with hatred, extreme hatred, and, at this moment, it fully exploded. His expression became ferocious, and he roared:</p>
 <p>“Shui Yueting, your heart is truly cruel. Since you didn’t successfully kill me at that time, today will be your funeral!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun stumbled up and down towards Dongfang Jingyue, and he got on top of her body. A fist suddenly struck her chest. Because Feng Feiyun was wounded earlier by the reverse power of his fist, this strike was not too powerful.</p>
 <p>This blow struck her chest; however, it essentially didn’t pierce through her body, and instead, more than half of its power was dissipated by her two towering twin peaks.</p>
 <p>Nobody expected that this blow from Feng Feiyun also pushed out half of the corpse poison inside Dongfang Jingyue’s body.</p>
 <p>“Poof!”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue’s cherry lips spat out a mouthful of dark blood directly onto Feng Feiyun’s face.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s expression was already ferocious, but it became even more frightening.</p>
 <p>“You actually dared to spurt on my face… You dared to spurt on my face…”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun, again, wanted to take her life with another blow.</p>
 <p>“Mmmmm…”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue slowly woke up. Her beautiful pair of eyes opened. Her body seemed to still be extremely weak. She could feel the pain coming from her chest, and she saw Feng Feiyun riding on her slender waist — she immediately thought of something.</p>
 <p>Thinking about the things that could have occurred, Dongfang Jingyue almost vomited blood from anger. This bastard Feng Feiyun was so wretched; he took advantage of her being unconscious, and then…</p>
 <p>She felt a terrible pain in her chest; it was as if Feng Feiyun was kneading them for a long time. Moreover, he also used great strength to knead them; how could this bastard be so low life!</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue then thought about other things that could have happened to her body, and suddenly, a teardrop fell from her eye; she mercilessly gazed at Feng Feiyun:</p>
 <p>“Feng… Feng… Feiyun, I… until now… have never seen… such a low life and shameless bastard like you…”</p>
 <p>“Peh!”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue, again, spat on Feng Feiyun’s face. At this moment, her mind was confused, and she had the impulse to commit suicide.</p>
 <p>“You spat on me? You spat on me again…? Shui Yueting, when it comes to being shameless and a low life, I am not equal to one part of you. Today, I will make you pay all of the debts you owe me.”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s eyes turned red, and his hands became sharp claws wanting to suffocate her.</p>
 <p>One couldn’t blame Feng Feiyun for becoming so berserk; it was simply because his hatred towards Shui Yueting was too deep. In this world, only Shui Yueting could cause him to become so confused and distraught.</p>
 <p>“Feng Feiyun, you committed outrageous deeds, yet you still dare to blame me? You are essentially not worthy to be a man!”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue’s anger was no less than Feng Feiyun’s. Her pure holy body was ravaged by Feng Feiyun; her not cursing was proof to see how trained she was.</p>
 <p>“Not worthy of being a man? Not worthy of being a man? You say I am not worthy of being a man? Hahaha! I am already a man; this is an indisputable fact, and it impossible to change… Hahaha!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun lifted his head, and he laughed; it was an extremely carefree and unrestrained laughter.</p>
 <p>The person he was referring to was naturally Shui Yueting and not Dongfang Jingyue!</p>
 <p>However, after hearing this, Dongfang Jingyue’s expression became sickly pale; her chest was angrily rising and falling, and she inadvertently vomited blood onto Feng Feiyun’s face again:</p>
 <p>“You… You, you actually… You actually…”</p>
 <p>She initially thought that Feng Feiyun only touched her breasts, but she didn’t expect Feng Feiyun to be such a beast, destroying her purity…</p>
 <p>Her mind went black, and she immediately passed out.</p>
 <p>After his laughter, he became calm again. He saw that he was riding on top of Dongfang Jingyue’s body. He noticed that her chest was bruised by his blow.</p>
 <p>“Dongfang… Jingyue, it is over, finished. I mistook her for the wrong person again! Hitting women is not the style of I, Feng Feiyun!”</p>
 <p>Even though he still hated Dongfang Jingyue — he could still kill her with a direct blow instead of tormenting her like this — but this was not his style.</p>
 <p>Hitting a woman and killing a woman are two different concepts!</p>
 <p>“No wonder she said I am not worthy to be a man; when I was clouded by uncontrollable anger, I struck her chest. Fine, even though I, Feng Feiyun, am not a virtuous gentleman, I am clear and open with my own morality. Today, I will save your life to make it up for that blow earlier. It was meant for Shui Yueting, but I wrongfully struck you instead.”</p>
 <p>Of course, Feng Feiyun didn’t know that by saving this one life, in the future, there would be even more trouble for him!</p>
