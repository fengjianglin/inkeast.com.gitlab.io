 <p>“You were truly chased by her the whole night?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun knew that Dongfang Jingyue had arrived at Violet Firmament Ancient City. With her cultivation and the Haotian Spirit Mirror, maybe she really noticed his presence on Feng Jianxue’s body.</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue said:</p>
 <p>“You don’t trust my words?”</p>
 <p>“Hehe! I simply don’t trust that you could escape from her grasp!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun said.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue’s cultivation was extremely high. She also has a spirit treasure in her hand; even Feng Feiyun would have a difficult time escaping her grasp, not to mention Feng Jianxue’s cultivation was weaker than him. How could she actually escape from Dongfang Jingyue?</p>
 <p>Unless Feng Jianxue was hiding her cultivation?</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue’s eyes flashed a strange look, became silent for a moment, and then she answered:</p>
 <p>“Even I didn’t believe that I could escape from her grasp, but I really did escape.”</p>
 <p>This vague answer from her naturally was not the truth!</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun naturally saw through it from the looks of her eyes, but he didn’t want to reveal it. He didn’t want to guess a woman’s heart; even if one tried to guess, they wouldn’t be able to. Then why would he bother give himself an unnecessary headache!</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue obviously didn’t want to continue this topic, so she hurriedly asked:</p>
 <p>“Weren’t you following Du Shougao? Any results?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun laughed:</p>
 <p>“If I actually caught up with Du Shougao, then I’m afraid I wouldn’t make it back here right now.”</p>
 <p>“You truly didn’t catch up to him?”</p>
 <p>“Of course not!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun didn’t want her to know that he was chased by Du Shougao and the bewitching young man all around the city. Remembering the bewitching young man, Feng Feiyun couldn’t help but to furrow his brows, and he asked:</p>
 <p>“Did any heaven-defying genius appear in the fifth generation of the Feng Clan recently?”</p>
 <p>The cultivation of the bewitching young man was definitely not lower than Du Shougao by a large amount. This strength was greater than the Feng elders. If there was such a character within the fifth generation of the Feng Clan, he wouldn’t be able to stay unknown.</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue didn’t answer yet, but Feng Ming immediately stole the words:</p>
 <p>“I heard the fifth generation of the Feng Clan actually has a few heaven-defying geniuses; however, they are all located at extremely secret locations in order to break through to an ever higher rank. They are truly the most gifted of the younger generation of the Feng Clan. Their cultivation is even higher than people like Feng Yu; it is just that they haven’t shown themselves before, and they don’t want others to know.”</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue added:</p>
 <p>“I also heard of a related rumor; three years ago, the upper echelons of the Feng Clan recalled all of the real geniuses of the fifth generation, and they used a large amount of spirit medicine in order to groom them. They were also allowed to practice the top methods. Even a few ancestors wanted to personally teach them to become the future pillars of the Feng Clan.”</p>
 <p>There was no wall that a breeze couldn’t pass through in this world; even though this matter was done secretly, there were still rumors escaping.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun nodded his head, and he said:</p>
 <p>“This is right. A true grand clan would definitely groom a few absolutely brilliant geniuses, not these mediocre people.”</p>
 <p>So the absolutely brilliant geniuses were already summoned; could the bewitching young man be one of these people?</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue coldly scowled&nbsp;before saying:</p>
 <p>“No matter how great those heaven-defying talents are, what does it have to do with you? With your little bit of capability, you would be eliminated in the first round of the Hidden Dragon War. You best use your time to think about how to deal with that female dog. If she chases you all the way here, I’m afraid there will be quite a few people bitten to death by her!”</p>
 <p>Finished saying these words, she turned around and went inside. A “bang” sound occurred as the door closed.</p>
 <p>Her anger hasn’t subsided!</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun stood there in a daze, gently rubbed his neck, and then he laughed loudly:</p>
 <p>“If there is such a beautiful female dog in this world like her, then even if she bits me twice, I would still be very happy!”</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A chair flew out from the window and almost smashed Feng Feiyun in the head. It was fortunate that he dodged in time, otherwise there would be blood gushing from his head.</p>
 <p>“Too violent, too violent!”</p>
 <p>Even though Jianxue’s words were hard to listen to, they had some truths. If Dongfang Jingyue actually came to the Hidden Dragon Courtyard, then the destruction would be even higher compared to Du Shougao.</p>
 <p>When that time comes, even if Feng Feiyun didn’t want to become famous, it would be a difficult matter!</p>
 <p>“The sky above the Hidden Dragon Courtyard has a formation ready; even the Haotian Spirit Mirror wouldn’t necessarily be able to find me. As long as I don’t leave the Hidden Dragon Courtyard, then that damned grandma Dongfang Jingyue will definitely not be able to find me!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun didn’t want to think too much; he only wanted to begin analyzing the bamboo block really thoroughly.</p>
 <p>The bamboo block was around a palm long, with two fingers width. It was made from a jade bamboo from the Western Region. The quality of the wood was extremely hard; even an ordinary steel blade wouldn’t be able to cut it.</p>
 <p>After feeling it with his hand, he found that it was a bit cold and quite smooth; it was like he was holding a precious jade.</p>
 <p>There were mysterious and strange engravings on the bamboo block; it was as if it was a record of a corner of some mountains and rivers. Because the bamboo block was too small, one couldn’t get a full panoramic view of these mountains and rivers; thus, it was naturally difficult to tell where this place was located.</p>
 <p>“Mortal Life Cavern!”</p>
 <p>The middle of the bamboo block was inscribed with these words; each word was as small as a fly’s leg. Without meticulous observation, it would be difficult to find these four small prints.</p>
 <p>These words were “Mortal Life Cavern!”</p>
 <p>Next to the words was a dot painted by red ink; it seemed to be the location of the Mortal Life Cavern.</p>
 <p>‘Rumor has it that Feng Yu’s talents were low; even the foundation for cultivation was missing, but he found the hidden ground inside the Jing Huan Mountain, obtained a drop of spirit spring water, and he refined his bones and body. Not only did his talents become exceptional, but his cultivation also increased by leaps and bounds. Could that secret ground be the Mortal Life Cavern engraved on this bamboo block?’</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s thoughts increasingly expanded, and he came up with many things. Finally, he felt that this conclusion was quite rational.</p>
 <p>“If the engraving on this bamboo block is indeed the Jing Huan Mountain, then this proves the Mortal Life Cavern’s existence.”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was ecstatic. One had to know that spirit spring water could be compared to any spirit medicine and treasure; it could regenerate an amputated arm, refine the bones, and increase one’s cultivation.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s cultivation was the Immortal Phoenix Physique; if he could obtain a drop of spirit spring water, then his speed would dramatically accelerate. If he could reach the third level of Blood Purification, then his cultivation would become exceedingly high. At that point, he naturally wouldn’t be afraid of Du Shougao or the bewitching young man.</p>
 <p>When Feng Yu found the spirit spring water, his body was of an ordinary mortal. At most, he could only digest one drop of spirit spring water. Any more and his body would surely burst into death.</p>
 <p>If this bamboo block really engraved the location of the Mortal Life Cavern, then Feng Yu definitely was waiting until his cultivation was stronger; he would then return to use more spirit spring water to refine his body. He didn’t expect for the news to leak, and he invited a calamity of death instead.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun roughly guessed the cause and effect in this matter, but it was simply a conjecture. In the end, he couldn’t verify whether the bamboo block’s engravings were truly the location of the Jing Huan Mountain or not.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the main door was kicked away by someone. Feng Jianxue angrily entered the room, and she mildly shouted:</p>
 <p>“Feng Feiyun! You and the female dog — what the hell is going on?”</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue originally went back to her room to meditate; however, the more she thought about the matter, the angrier she became. In the end, she couldn’t hold back, and she immediately rushed over, wanting to make this matter clear.</p>
 <p>If this brat Feng Feiyun had sworn to change completely, then how could he go to places to fondle the flowers and trample the grass? If she didn’t ask and reach a clear conclusion, then she couldn’t meditate in peace.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was researching the bamboo block, but she suddenly rushed in. He quickly hid the bamboo block in his hand into his sleeve.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun awkwardly coughed twice, and he said:</p>
 <p>“Cough cough! Wife, this matter… swearing at someone else is not a good habit!”</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue’s exquisite jade nose knitted, and her lips gently pouted. She went straight to Feng Feiyun, who was standing next to the bed, looked at his robe’s sleeves, then grabbed it, and she said:</p>
 <p>“What did you just hide in the sleeve?”</p>
 <p>“Shit, you even saw that?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun thought that he didn’t leave any trace, but he didn’t think she had seen through it.</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue’s age wasn’t high, plus her figure was slender, but she was not a nice girl. She directly gripped Feng Feiyun’s hand, and then her tiny hands immediately probed his sleeves.</p>
 <p>Her hands were warm and smooth. The contact between their hands created a little electric shock, causing a charming romantic feeling.</p>
 <p>Feiyun went into a daze, causing his head to imagine vivid thoughts!</p>
 <p>Even though he really liked the feeling, Feng Feiyun began to struggle; it was as if he was being ****** by her, and he shockingly exclaimed:</p>
 <p>“We can’t! Wife ah, you touching me is tickling me too much!”</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue also felt that something was strangely wrong, and her face went red with shame. She quickly let go of his hand, and she said:</p>
 <p>“Then you take it out yourself, I won’t touch anymore!”</p>
 <p>But after these words came out, she immediately regretted it. These words were truly too stimulating to others.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun happily laughed:</p>
 <p>“This kind of treasure, I’m not afraid to take it out! No, no… don’t hit me, I’ll take it out, isn’t it fine if I just take it out! Too violent, way too violent!”</p>
 <p>Feng Jianxue was still only a little girl around the age of fourteen, and she was only younger than Feng Feiyun by three days. Moreover, since the two youths had been together, they could be considered green plums and hobby-horse and innocent young playmates.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was quite at ease with her, plus Feng Jianxue was living in Violet Firmament Ancient City all year around, thus, she was familiar with the surrounding areas. Maybe she could recognize the location on this bamboo block.</p>
 <p>If the bamboo block truly has the location with spirit spring water, Feng Feiyun wouldn’t mind giving her two drops.</p>
