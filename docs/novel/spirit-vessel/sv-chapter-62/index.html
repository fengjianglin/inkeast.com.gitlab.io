<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The underground godly temple was pitch black, full of humidity, and grim looking; even though, in the far distance, there was a lit Buddhist torch on top of the pagoda, the light couldn’t dissipate this darkness.</p>
 <p>No one knew why this godly temple sunk into the ground for the past few thousand years, or why the buddhist torch still was lit; it radiated a divine light, just like the lotus seat’s light, traveling towards all four directions.</p>
 <p>The shape of the lotus seat was the same as a human’s footprint.</p>
 <p>The two people standing on the lotus seat were Feng Feiyun and Dongfang Jingyue.</p>
 <p>The two were originally like fire and water, refusing to stand beside each other, but at this moment, they were leaning on each other like one’s figure and shadow. Even though Feng Feiyun was just a young adult, his stature was not small. With a wide chest and standing at seven feet tall, he was seemingly higher than Dongfang Jingyue by half of a head.</p>
 <p>The lotus seat was truly too small as there was not enough space for one person standing on top, let alone two people squeezing together. Dongfang Jingyue was standing in front of Feng Feiyun, but her orientation was that of leaning close to his chest.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue was wearing a white veil. Her emotionless expression seemingly had forgotten about the earlier hatred, but Feng Feiyun knew that if it wasn’t for his understanding of formations and deduction of the arts, he would have been a lost ghost by her hand.</p>
 <p>“Feng Feiyun, could it be that all of Feng's young children have the same understanding of formations just like you?”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue, in the end, couldn’t restrain her curiosity and seriously asked.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Feng Feiyun carved the Corpse Refining Formation to suppress the three ancient monk corpses, and now he created a Crossing Lotus Seat Formation to easily escape the Sea of Blood Formation and the Bewildering Grand Formation.</p>
 <p>It was her first time seeing these two methods. Even the formations of contemporary masters wouldn’t be as proficient; however, in the hands of Feng Feiyun, it was as if every word he wrote became poetic proses.</p>
 <p>If all the children of the Feng Clan were this wonderful, then it would truly be frightening.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue was a child of the Yin Gou Clan, so she naturally had the responsibility to destroy any power that could threaten the clan. If Feng Feiyun was truly this powerful, then she must kill him without mercy and destroy the grass to its root.</p>
 <p>For a clan as powerful as the Yin Gou Clan, wanting to destroy one hundred Feng Clans was an easy matter.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was very clever, and, with just a glance, he knew what Dongfang Jingyue was calculating in her mind; thus, he smiled:</p>
 <p>“No, of course not; unless it was a person with an extreme aptitude, the elders of the clan absolutely wouldn’t allow us to learn it. In the end, learning these unorthodox methods would slow down our cultivations, ah!”</p>
 <p>And he continued:</p>
 <p>“It is also clear that I have an extreme aptitude, hahaha!”</p>
 <p>“That is why your cultivation is so weak; it seems like the elders of your clan didn’t worry without reasons.”</p>
 <p>Even though Dongfang Jingyue was teasing Feng Feiyun, the wariness in her heart had lowered by quite a bit.</p>
 <p>Of course, out of ten phrases coming out of Feng Feiyun’s mouth, nine couldn’t be trusted. Dongfang Jingyue naturally would still maintain some sort of caution. Once leaving the Mortal Life Cavern, she would definitely investigate this matter thoroughly to achieve a real peace of mind.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun ignored her teasing; in the end, his cultivation time was very short and he couldn’t compete with her. If he also cultivated for eight or ten years, then he would definitely disappear right before her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Shh! Do you hear a sound?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun focused on listening, and he felt that there was something next to him dripping down. He was ecstatic. He stomped on the lotus seat, flew outside of it, and he reached out his hand to grab a translucent drop of dew.</p>
 <p>This drop of dew, from a gap between the brown tree barks, was from an ancient tree that had died many thousand years ago. It was filled with spirit and life energy. It was originally going to fall into the ancient well’s mouth, but it was discovered by Feiyun and caught in mid air.</p>
 <p>“Such a powerful spirit, could this be a drop of Spirit Spring Water?”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue was also extremely excited, and she directly gripped Feng Feiyun’s wrist, forcing him to open his palm, and took away the drop of dew.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed a drop of Spirit Spring Water.”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue acted like there was no one next to her, and she carefully observed the drop of dew. Inside the Spirit Spring Water was a shadow of a small girl the size of a rice grain; it was as if she was sleeping calmly.</p>
 <p>This was naturally not a little girl; it was simply the spirit condensed inside the Spirit Spring Water.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun came to the Mortal Life Cavern precisely to find Spirit Spring Water to increase his cultivation. Through arduous hard work, he finally obtained a drop of it in his hand, yet it suddenly changed its owner.</p>
 <p>“I can’t imagine that a grand character from the renowned Yin Gou Clan would commit such a robbery!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun shook his wrist back and forth. This damned grandma Dongfang Jingyue’s move was too vicious, and a bloody bruise was left on his wrist by her.</p>
 <p>“The ancestor of our Yin Gou Clan indeed became prosperous from robbery!”</p>
 <p>Of course Dongfang Jingyue also wanted the Spirit Spring Water to break through to the next realm, so she absolutely wouldn’t give the drop back to Feng Feiyun. Her eyes slightly raised upward towards the sky, and she carefully stared at the dead and dried ancient tree. Spirit Spring Water was dropping from its body, but there was something odd going on.</p>
 <p>This ancient tree was one hundred and thirty zhang tall, with a radius of four to five zhang. Its exterior was dry like the yellow soil on the ground, and there were many weather parts in the tree trunks, riddled with thousands of holes on its body.</p>
 <p>The life of this tree had ended many thousand years ago, so how could it give birth to Spirit Spring Water?</p>
 <p>One has to know that Spirit Spring Water was a wonder medicine in this world. When a mortal drank a drop, he could live for two hundred years. When a cultivator consumed a drop, not only could it refine the body and increase one’s innate talent, but it could also help them break through to the next realm.</p>
 <p>Obtaining one drop could already be considered a grand immortal fortune!</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was also looking for clues. In the end, he would be such a rich man if he could find the originating location of the Spirit Spring Water.</p>
 <p>His gaze finally locked onto the ancient well with a layer of yellow mud under the ancient tree. If Feng Feiyun didn’t make a move earlier, the drop would have fallen down the ancient well; so this ancient well was certainly not ordinary.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun didn’t feel like there was anything strange, but after looking at the well a few more times, he felt some tightness in his chest. It was as if all of his internal organs were wanting to burst open.</p>
 <p>“Poof!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s entire body was in shock, his chest in great pain, and he vomited a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>‘How could this be… Can’t even look at it… What mysteries could be hidden inside this ancient well?’</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth; he was not deterred but even more excited.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue coldly sneered:</p>
 <p>“You don’t know life from death? Don’t you know that there are some forbidden things in this world? Not to mention a gaze, even thinking about them is impossible!”</p>
 <p>“The more taboo the place is, the more worthy it is to take a risk. Maybe this yellow ancient well is filled with Spirit Spring Water. If we get a Spirit Spring Water well, then imagine how many masters we could cultivate? Not mentioning the Yin Gou Clan, we could even overthrow the Jin Dynasty!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun radiantly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue quickly grabbed Feng Feiyun’s neck, and she whispered:</p>
 <p>“Do you not want to live any longer? The Jin Emperor’s cultivation is mysteriously powerful. One gaze is enough to see matters within one million miles, and one ear is enough to hear the canary bird’s singing outside of ten thousand miles. If those words of yours were heard by him, then it won’t only be you; the nine clans of your Feng Clan would all be massacred.”</p>
 <p>“Cough cough!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s neck was in pain from her grip, but he still smiled:</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry! Chicken Dongfang, the Jin Emperor’s cultivation might be powerful, but he totally cannot detect the godly spirit inside this underground temple; so nervous my ass!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Dongfang Jingyue let go of Feng Feiyun and she coldly said:</p>
 <p>“Your mouth is truly very vulgar. It is best to remember my words well, otherwise, sooner or later, you will suffer an unnatural death. There was crying inside the ancient well; in my eyes, that is not a Spirit Spring Water well but a corpse water well. You still shouldn’t act rashly.”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue naturally was afraid that; if Feng Feiyun died in the well, she wouldn’t be able to control the lotus seat formation and thus, she reminded him.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun had soon noted this matter, and that was why he didn’t make a move. However, if it was only a strand of crying remnants, giving up the Spirit Spring Water well would make him feel very hesitant.</p>
 <p>Just then, from the darkness came many heavy footsteps.</p>
 <p>“Third Uncle, what the hell is this place? Causing twelve out of our fifteen protectors to die. Will we die in this place as well?”</p>
 <p>The voice of a middle-aged man appeared.</p>
 <p>“Shut up. As long as we don’t meet those ancient monk corpses again, we will definitely escape this godly temple.”</p>
 <p>An older voice sounded, but it was not filled with much confidence.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man said:</p>
 <p>“When Seventh Uncle was bitten to death, Sixth Uncle was decapitated, and even Feng Xiaolin was dragged into the buddhist hall, only his white bones were thrown out; then there was also…”</p>
 <p>The fifteen protectors came into the Mortal Life Cavern in order to chase down Du Shougao, and they also mistakenly went into this temple. However, their luck was not as good as Feng Feiyun, and they went into the main entrance of the temple; eight of them were ripped into pieces by the monk corpses.</p>
 <p>The other remaining seven hid in the temple, and they met all types of ghostly creatures. In the end, only three were left, and all of them were heavily wounded. They fled toward Feiyun’s direction.</p>
 <p>“Third Uncle, there are people ahead!”</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man excitedly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The three of them quickened their pace and ran towards Feng Feiyun; it was as if they had seized the last path of survival.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun carefully gazed at the old man leading the way. He was a bit surprised; the heavy armor on this old man was taken off, and he was only wearing a Feng Clan robe. The white robe was embroidered with an ancient pine and inscribed with three black words: “Feng Zhizi.”</p>
 <p>Feng Zhizi was the name of this old man.</p>
 <p>After seeing this name, Feng Feiyun suddenly froze. Wasn’t his grandpa’s name Feng Zhizi?</p>
 <p>Of course Feng Feiyun was able to recognize his grandpa. After all, when he was a child, he had met him a few times. Even though the body armor was taken off, the steel helmet on his body was not removed; it still covered half of his face. Without a careful look, he naturally couldn’t recognize him.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was alarmed by this; Feng Zhizi had never been so tattered before. What terrible things did they meet in the end?</p>
 <p>“An expert from the Yin Gou Clan? We are saved this time.”</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man recognized the iron token on Dongfang Jingyue’s waist, and he spoke with great admiration.</p>
 <p>“Expert from the Yin Gou Clan?”</p>
 <p>Of course Feng Zhizi knew just how powerful the Yin Gou Clan was, definitely more than the other two. In front of the Yin Gou Clan, he couldn’t act rashly; this matter had been told to him earlier by the Feng Patriarch.</p>
 <p>This girl was able to carry the white jade iron token of the Yin Gou Clan, so she was definitely a descendant. He couldn’t be late on the courteous formality; he had to bow down. Otherwise, it would be disrespectful.</p>
