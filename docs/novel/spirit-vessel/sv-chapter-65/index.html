<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The peace within the entire godly temple was restored, but this peace and quiet carried a false sensation.</p>
 <p>The Buddhist candle on the highest floor of the Buddhist pagoda remained bright and forever eternal.</p>
 <p>Outside of the godly temple, the atmosphere became tense. In a flash, another Giant appeared.</p>
 <p>This Giant sat in an ancient bronze carriage, driven by a godly deer that held an aura no less powerful than the other two Giants in front, which denied others the sense of ease.</p>
 <p>An invisible pressure also followed the carriage and became increasingly stronger, causing the energy in the air to create traction and it turned into a huge source of power.</p>
 <p>Even though it was just an ordinary bronze carriage, its presence felt like a heavenly army on an expedition!</p>
 <p>The driver was a handsome young teen, adorned with a gold robe and a long sword on his back, around the age of seventeen. With this age, he was no longer considered an infant, yet on his neck was a silver locket meant for infants.</p>
 <p>Qin Ming stretched his back and looked at the godly temple in the far distance, then gazed at the crowd near his vicinity. His legs were uncomfortable from the long distance traveling.</p>
 <p>He jumped off the bronze carriage and took off the sword on his back. The long sword in his hand was indeed extremely swift and in a flash, there were many sword auras appearing on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Bang, bang, bang…”</p>
 <p>Dust on the ground was scattered about and when the dust storm settled, domineering characters appeared at the scene.</p>
 <p>“The Qin Clan ancestor has arrived!”</p>
 <p>The power of the Qin Clan in the Grand Southern Prefecture was great. It was one of the leading clans with power identical to the Feng Clan — definitely an overlord of one direction.</p>
 <p>“Within the bronze carriage is an ancestor of the Qin Clan, this is really not good!”</p>
 <p>Feng Zhizi’s face became serious and carefully gazed at the ancient bronze carriage outside of the godly temple.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun didn’t understand and asked:</p>
 <p>“Why is it not good?”</p>
 <p>“The Qin Clan and the Feng Clan are the two top clans of the Grand Southern Prefecture with similar power, so only the Prefecture Governor is able to suppress our two houses. Of course, the Prefecture Governor was a character of the Tian Hou level in the Jin Dynasty so our two houses definitely cannot catch up. However, he also doesn’t care about the conflicts between major powers.”</p>
 <p>“The Qin Clan and the Feng Clan have many grievances throughout the years; many talented Feng disciples died in the hands of the Qin Clan. Of course, Qin disciples also died in the hands of our own experts. The hatred between our two houses became deeper and deeper; if it wasn’t for the Prefecture Governor taking charge, our two clans would have fought to the bitter end already.”</p>
 <p>“The clan masters of both the clans, throughout the generations, have always been ones with great foresight and knew that our powers were not quite different. If we truly fought to the bitter end, then both houses would suffer greatly, so both sides were waiting for just the right opportunity.”</p>
 <p>Feng Zhizi truthfully brought out all of the grievances between the two clans into the open and his eyes became more anxious with contemplation.</p>
 <p>“What opportunity?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun asked.</p>
 <p>Feng Zhizi continued:</p>
 <p>“When the balance between the two clans is lost, one side will attack the other while not giving them a chance to turn around. At this moment, there must be a heaven-shattering secret in this godly temple. If the ancestor of the Qin Clan was to seize this treasure, his battle power would definitely soar. At that point, our Feng ancestor wouldn’t be a match for him.”</p>
 <p>“When the Feng ancestor is defeated or dead, the destruction of the Feng Clan would be easy for the Qin Clan.”</p>
 <p>Sometimes, the war between clans was simply decided by a battle of the masters. Whoever won would become king; the loser would become lost souls!</p>
 <p>The Qin ancestor was a reclusive person. If there wasn’t an appearance of a great treasure, then why would he rush here so quickly? It was clear that there was something unfathomable inside this godly temple, attracting the Giants from all directions to quickly rush here.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s eyes slightly shrunk and he channeled the Phoenix Heavenly Gaze towards the ancient bronze carriage, but he couldn’t see through to the inside. Who on earth was inside the carriage? He could only see strands of shadows flying around the ancient carriage as if the Qin ancestor was practicing a certain cultivation method.</p>
 <p>“A junior from some little hole dares to peek at our house’s ancestor!? Your one glance, I will pay you back with one as well.”</p>
 <p>Qin Ming felt the gaze of Feng Feiyun and his eyes also focused, then turned into a tiny needle.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>A sword energy around the size of an ox’s hair flew out from his pupil!</p>
 <p>The reaction of this person was extremely fast and he had a high awareness; worthy of being a young genius. Also, his sword gaze was even faster compared to the dual gaze technique of Feng Jianxue, rendering others unable to escape.</p>
 <p>“Immortal Phoenix Physique!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun naturally couldn’t escape this sword, but he channeled his Immortal Phoenix Physique and the blood in his body quickly channeled, allowing this sword aura to pierce through the middle of his eyebrows.</p>
 <p>“Phoosh!”</p>
 <p>The tiny sword energy was extremely sharp and in a flash, it penetrated Feng Feiyun’s forehead.</p>
 <p>The sword energy invading the body was extremely painful, but once it came into contact with Feng Feiyun’s channeled blood, this invincible sword energy began to dissipate.</p>
 <p>Just like ice meeting boiling water!</p>
 <p>Of course, this was because this sword gaze energy of Qin Ming was far too small; this was why Feng Feiyun was able to use his boiling blood to melt it so quickly. If this was the Dual Gaze Fragmenting Moon Sword from Feng Jianxue, even if the power wasn’t as focused as this sword energy, Feng Feiyun absolutely wouldn’t meet it with his body — doing so would be akin to seeking death.</p>
 <p>After Qin Ming saw that his sword energy had pierced through Feng Feiyun’s forehead, he mockingly smirked and said:</p>
 <p>“Can’t even block one blow!”</p>
 <p>Even though Feng Zhizi and the other two protectors of the Feng Clan were standing very close to Feng Feiyun, they were too slow to react. When they tried to stop the sword energy, it had already pierced through Feng Feiyun’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Feng Zhizi’s heart was filled with anxiety; his old gaze became crimson. He actually had to watch his only grandson die in front of him.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue, standing in front of Feng Feiyun, saw with her own eyes the sword energy piercing his forehead and even heard the sound of flesh being cut through.</p>
 <p>There was a red dot of blood on Feng Feiyun’s forehead. His eyes were dull and he remained motionless as if he was dead.</p>
 <p>“Feng Feiyun, I tried to kill you twice yet you still survived; how could you die at the hands of an outsider?”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue suddenly punched Feng Feiyun’s chest.</p>
 <p>Once Feng Feiyun was dead, there would be no one able to control the lotus seat so escaping the godly temple would be very difficult. As a result, she was naturally angry.</p>
 <p>“Ouch! Not so hard, all of my bones feel like they’re almost breaking!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun covered his chest and kept on coughing.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue’s tender body shuddered, and naturally, she was scared out of her mind by Feng Feiyun. This little brat still wasn’t dead?</p>
 <p>How could this be?</p>
 <p>He was pierced by a sword through the forehead, how could he still survive?</p>
 <p>Not only was Dongfang Jingyue in a daze, but Feng Zhizi was also shocked and unable to react. It was as if he was a stone statue.</p>
 <p>“Clank clang!”</p>
 <p>In the far distance, the sword in Qin Ming’s hand suddenly fell to the ground!</p>
 <p>Even the three characters of the Giant rank wanted to rush over. Although it was just a glance, the three Giants had noted this strange Feng Feiyun character.</p>
 <p>He was pierced by a sword through the forehead yet he still didn’t die; could it be a reincarnation of a demon’s spawn? Many people here shared this same line of thought!</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue was, of course, the most depressed. She began to doubt: With her own ability, would she be able to kill this shameless man in the future?</p>
