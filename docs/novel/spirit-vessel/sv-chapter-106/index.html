 <p>When dusk descended, the trio finally left Wang Wu Mountain and entered a small old town. The bustling crowd was slowly resounding in their ears.</p>
 <p>They finally made it to Green Maple Town.</p>
 <p>Even though the town was small, it had everything!</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun had been here for five days and was gradually adapting to everything.</p>
 <p>With his eyes closed and legs crossed while his hands were slightly folded in front of his chest, lights were condensing in his hands, exuding some sparkling lights. His palms slowly pushed outward and unleashed a strike that struck three meters away, hitting an iron bell as big as a head and created a buzzing sound.</p>
 <p>He recalled his palms and opened his eyes!</p>
 <p>“Yes! Finally restored three parts of my power!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun felt the blood in his body flowing everywhere and his veins were filled with spirit energy.</p>
 <p>“Creaking!”</p>
 <p>The door of the wooden storage room was opened, letting a ray of sunshine in.</p>
 <p>“Hey, still alive?”</p>
 <p>Ji Xiaonu stood at the door while loudly asking Feng Feiyun.</p>
 <p>“Can’t die just yet, I’m still alive. At this moment, I feel as strong as a dragon or a tiger and can even knock down an ox.”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun jumped up from the haystack and was laughing nonstop.</p>
 <p>Ji Xiaonu glared at him and then coldly said:</p>
 <p>“If this is the case, then you can go now, right?”</p>
 <p>“Go? Go where?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun pretended to not know anything.</p>
 <p>“You ate and slept for free at my house for five days, don’t tell me you want to keep on freeloading?”</p>
 <p>Ji Xiaonu never saw eye to eye with Feng Feiyun and wished that she could kick him out even sooner.</p>
 <p>However, Ji Xinnu was a very kind girl and had always taken care of Feng Feiyun. Even though Ji Xiaonu was unruly, she also never went against her sister’s words.</p>
 <p>While her sister was out selling herbs, Ji Xiaonu decided to go behind her back and chase Feng Feiyun away.</p>
 <p>Before returning to peak condition, how could Feng Feiyun leave? Even if it was shameless, he would still stay behind. This place was far away from the cultivation world and was an opportune haven for him.</p>
 <p>After the battle at Jing Huan Mountain, Feng Feiyun’s reputation was thunderous, resulting in many cultivators knowing his appearance. Once someone recognized him, it would bring about countless pursuers.</p>
 <p>Before reaching his peak condition, it was better for him to not show his face in the cultivation world.</p>
 <p>“Miss Xiaonu, I won’t be a freeloader for you two girls. If there is any menial hard work later, just leave it to me!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun sat down on the floor again.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“What can I mean? I’m not planning to leave. I want to stay behind to take care of you guys. Two beautiful young girls living together is very dangerous, ah! It is really not fine for this house to not have a man!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun began to exclaim.</p>
 <p>Ji Xiaonu’s eyes were showing a hint of impatience. It seemed like Big Sister really brought home a scoundrel. This bastard was probably lusting after our beauty. There would be trouble sooner or later if we keep him here.</p>
 <p>He was definitely was not a good person. He could be a desperate thief on the run!</p>
 <p>Green Maple Town was at the boundary of Fire Beacon City so, each year, there were many escapists that used this route to escape into Fire Beacon City. This beggar could be such a person.</p>
 <p>A murderous thought appeared in Ji Xiaonu’s mind. Anyone that could survive in this town, even a young girl, would all greatly value caution. When they met a bad person, they would preemptively take action; otherwise, the ones harmed would be themselves.</p>
 <p>A cold wind blew forward causing Feng Feiyun to shiver. He felt the killing intent!</p>
 <p>A girl with killing intent was truly not simple. Feng Feiyun felt that this problem was a bit extraordinary. Even though his head was still down, he quickly peeked from the corner of his eye towards the door.</p>
 <p>The originally fragile girl’s eyes turned into a strange green. Even her long, black hair turned green as well and her fingernails quickly grew longer and sharper. Without a doubt, a claw from this hand would be enough to tear people into pieces.</p>
 <p>How did a girl in the middle of nowhere — without any cultivation — suddenly turn into such a frightening shape!</p>
 <p>The killing intent increasingly intensified and became colder like ice. Even though Feng Feiyun was sitting on the ground with his head down, his finger had already made a seal. If she truly took action, then he could only make a move first.</p>
 <p>“Xiaonu, what are you guys talking about?”</p>
 <p>Rapid footsteps came from outside. Ji Xinnu had came back and she was quickly approaching.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun dispersed the seal in his hand and the chilling murderous intent also disappeared in the blink of an eye. When Feng Feiyun lifted his head, Ji Xiaonu turned into an innocent little girl with black eyes and hair again. It was as if everything he saw earlier was just an illusion.</p>
 <p>Was it just an illusion?</p>
 <p>“Big Sister, why are you back so soon?”</p>
 <p>Ji Xiaonu grabbed her sister’s arm and revealed a brilliant smile.</p>
 <p>With a reproachful expression in her eyes, Ji Xinnu’s lips slightly moved. She was naturally scolding her, but there was no sound coming out.</p>
 <p>She finally sighed and shook her head and then went inside the wooden storage room. She gently smiled:</p>
 <p>“Did Xiaonu scare you earlier?”</p>
 <p>“What? No way! Big Sister Xinnu, what are you talking about, ah? Xiaonu is so cute like this, how can she scare me?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun stared blankly as if he didn’t know anything.</p>
 <p>Although Ji Xinnu was mild-mannered and had a faint smile on her face, her beautiful eyes — from start to finish — was carefully observing Feng Feiyun’s every move. She wanted to confirm whether he truly didn’t see anything or not.</p>
 <p>If Feng Feiyun revealed a slightly abnormal hint, then this gentle and lovable Big Sister Xinnu would kill him without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Ji Xinnu slightly glanced at Ji Xiaonu and was met by a gentle head shake. It was as if Xiaonu was telling her that Feng Feiyun didn’t see anything.</p>
 <p>At this moment, she finally calmed down and smiled:</p>
 <p>“That’s good then, that’s good. This brat, Xiaonu, grew up without parents so I always doted on her. This is why she is a little unreasonable and unruly. You shouldn’t blame her right away.”</p>
 <p>“How could I blame my savior? In fact, I think I should be taking my leave. If I stay here any longer, I might be affecting the relationship between you two sisters!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun felt a sense of dread from the earlier transformation of Ji Xiaonu.</p>
 <p>One had to know that he had the soul of a phoenix and his spiritual sense was very accurate. Due to the side effect of the ancient pill, his spirit sense weakened; however, it absolutely shouldn’t have been unable to find anything strange about these two. This meant that these two sisters were not simple — truly not simple.</p>
 <p>A pair of poor sisters… The older one at sixteen years old and the younger one at fourteen years old was capable of surviving independently in an inhabitable city such as Fire Beacon City… Not only this, but they often traveled to the mountain as well. This was definitely not something ordinary girls could do.</p>
 <p>Just this alone revealed the unusual situation, but Feng Feiyun had not thought of it before. The killing intent from earlier was real, along with the green eyes, green hair, and those sharp claws. All of it gave Feng Feiyun an intensifying ominous feeling.</p>
 <p>There seems to be a problem, ah!</p>
 <p>Cannot stay in this place any longer!</p>
 <p>“Earlier, you didn’t want to leave when I tried to kick you out, how come you suddenly want to leave?”</p>
 <p>Ji Xiaonu exposed a glimmering sense of doubt in her eyes. She also came in and stared at Feng Feiyun with her jet-black round eyes.</p>
 <p>She squatted to the right-hand side of Feng Feiyun and gently placed her small hand on his shoulder. Even though she transformed earlier, Feng Feiyun was sitting on the ground with his head down. He truly didn’t see anything.</p>
 <p>However, why did he suddenly want to leave? What would be the explanation for this?</p>
 <p>Could he have really seen my transformation from earlier so he wanted to leave out of fear? If this was the case, then they absolutely couldn’t let him leave this place alive!</p>
 <p>This matter had a grave implication. Even the normally gentle and pleasant Ji Xinnu raised some suspicions at this moment. If this beggar actually knew, then they could never let him leave this place.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, why do you suddenly have to go, ah? You aren’t completely well yet. Plus, you don’t have a home to go back to, so where can you go?”</p>
 <p>Ji Xinnu also stared at him intensely as she slowly placed her jade-like hand on his other shoulder. Her voice was still soft like before, and her smile was full of kindness!</p>
 <p>Two beautiful girls, sitting left and right of him. Plus, they were both charmingly staring at him. Their jade-like hands were on his shoulders in a very intimate manner. Any man in this scenario would have laughed out loud and hugged them into his arms.</p>
 <p>However, Feng Feiyun felt as if there were two centipedes crawling over his body. At this moment, if he said the wrong words, then these slender jade-like hands of theirs on his shoulders would directly tear him in half.</p>
 <p>Their eyes continuously blinked, but they never averted their gaze from Feng Feiyun. They only wanted a reasonable explanation. If Feng Feiyun couldn’t come up with anything, then this meant that their identities have been revealed and that he must die!”</p>
 <p>“I… Why, why did I want to leave? It is, it is because… I found that I…”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun stuttered, and his face became redder and redder. The blood rushed all the way to his neck. He slowly lowered his head as if he was mustering all of his courage, then he finally said:</p>
 <p>“I… I found that I like Big Sister Xinnu. I really cannot restraint this love in my heart. After you saved my life next to the small stream in the mountain, along the way, I always silently remembered it in my heart. Sometimes, emotions just come so suddenly, and I was not prepared. I know that in Big Sister Xinnu’s eyes, I am just a beggar. You saved me because you pitied me. However, I can’t extricate myself… I can’t help myself from falling in love with you.”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun bitterly shook his head and smiled till tears flowed out, and he said:</p>
 <p>“I know I am not worthy of you, and you also don’t think much of me. Compared to sitting in the wooded storage room every night while being tormented by love, I would rather leave this place early. Xiaonu is right, I cannot linger in this place. I am trash and a freeloader, but… even if I leave this place, I will never be able to forget you. You are engraved in my heart and carved into my bones. Big Sister Xinnu, am I foolish? You want to tell me to leave this place, right?”</p>
