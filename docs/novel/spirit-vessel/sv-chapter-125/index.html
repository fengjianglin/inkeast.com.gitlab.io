 <p>“Rumble!”</p>
 <p>The earth started to shake in the wilderness for some time, causing the birds in the underbrush to fly away!</p>
 <p>“Ha, what is going on here!” Wang Meng withdrew his huge bare arms back in a defensive position as his body shrank from being startled.</p>
 <p>Wang Meng was one of the four bandits that Feng Feiyun brought along this time. This guy wore big trousers with a large hemp rope as big as an arm wrapped around his waist. Draping over his shoulder was a white large shirt that accentuated his strong, powerful, and tanned arms. His arms — compared to Feng Feiyun — were three times larger.</p>
 <p>His physique was appropriate for his name; he was absolutely a fierce male. Everywhere on his body had bulging muscles the size of a big arm. One glare of his, alone, was enough to make children cry.</p>
 <p>He was indeed the defining image for a bad guy!</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun and the four bandits stopped at the same time and looked back just to see that there were more than ten Qilins running from the billowing smoky horizon. Each Qilin was several meters tall with bodies bigger than even elephants that were covered with scales.</p>
 <p>These were real Qilins, not Qilins created by powerful energy.</p>
 <p>It was a team of armored soldiers wielding long spears while riding on the Qilins with flying speed going forward.</p>
 <p>They were actually using Qilins as mounts. This was a beast of war. Without a peak Immortal Foundation, one simply couldn’t control them. Clearly, this team had an incredible background along with impressive battle prowess.</p>
 <p>“That is the grand flag of the Godly Martial Army, these are the people from the Qilin War Cavalry — elites of the Godly Martial group.” Liu Qinsheng spoke as he was stroking his goatee.</p>
 <p>Liu Qinsheng was also one of the four bandits and the only person who appeared to be more intellectual and gentle. He was around forty years old, with a blue robe with a tail end piece attached behind while wearing grass slippers.</p>
 <p>Of course, what is considered gentle was only due to the contrasting image of Wang Meng and Wu Jiu next to him. In the end, how gentle could a person who killed someone just to drink flower wine be?</p>
 <p>Fire Beacon City’s Godly Martial Army was not the real Godly Martial Army of the Godly Jin Dynasty. They were only an army formed by cultivators in this region.</p>
 <p>Fire Beacon City was located in the southern frontier border in the middle of the Godly Jin Dynasty, the Po Luo Country, and the Grand Eclipse Country. It was a place without any sovereignty where the experts congregated and evil doers ran amok. This place utilized the law of the jungle, and the role played by the Godly Martial Army was, in fact, rather limited.</p>
 <p>“The Qilin War Cavalry — in total — only has around thirty people; they are elites of the elite. There must be half of them here.” Liu Qinsheng said.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun stared at the ten huge Qilin over there and was very excited. This was a powerful force, and as a vanguard, they could break through an army of ten thousand.</p>
 <p>“If we can bring the thirty Qilins of this cavalry back to the Huang Feng Ridge, then we will become so domineering.” Feng Feiyun said.</p>
 <p>The four bandits were not nice people and revealed a crafty smile as they stared at the approaching Qilin army.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!”</p>
 <p>The Qilin army sweeping through caused a large amount of dust and dirt to fly onto the group of Feng Feiyun. Even their faces were covered by dirt and sand, so they were loudly shouting curses.</p>
 <p>Their cursing had not yet ended but the Qilin War Cavalry, who were riding quickly past, turned around and stopped in front of the five. More than ten gazes came down from above and stared at the five ragged clothed people.</p>
 <p>Luo Lin, riding high on top of the Qilin’s back, stared at the five strange-looking people in front of him. One was wearing a great iron saber, one had bare black arms, and one was a hunchback. Only the boy standing ahead had a normal appearance and was easier to look at than the rest. However, his feet were bare as well having messy hair that was still covered with dust.</p>
 <p>This group of people — no matter what — didn’t look to be normal. They were more like refugees, or slaves of a slave camp.</p>
 <p>Luo Lin revealed a contemptuous look. He stroked the white spear in his hand and arrogantly asked: “Have you all seen a monk and a beautiful girl coming past here?”</p>
 <p>The five people shook their heads at the same time.</p>
 <p>Luo Lin frowned and, with eyes as cold as ice, swept over the five people, then he continued: “This monk is a murderous monk who kills people without blinking an eye. If I know you all purposefully hid this, then Fire Beacon City’s walls will have a few more bodies hanging on it.”</p>
 <p>Luo Lin was quite angry at this moment. One hour ago, he initially was patrolling with fellow Qilin cavalrymen and met a monk covered with tattoos with a jar of wine on his hand along the way.</p>
 <p>Where in this world would there be a monk with an Azure Dragon and White Tiger on his chest?</p>
 <p>Where in this world would there be a monk opening his large mouth to drink wine?</p>
 <p>Luo Lin decided that this was an evil monk on the spot and was sure that this monk escaped to Fire Beacon City to get away from his enemies.</p>
 <p>What most people couldn’t accept was that next to the evil monk was a beautiful young girl akin to a goddess around the age of fourteen or fifteen. She was prettier than all of the women Luo Lin had seen before.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t right, this evil monk did not only drink wine but was even a human trafficker. Seeing the pained expression on the girl’s face, Luo Lin immediately had the urge to become a hero by saving the beauty.</p>
 <p>Hehe, at this Fire Beacon City region, after a hero saves a beauty, she will absolutely use her body to repay the debt.</p>
 <p>If he could actually get such a city toppling little beauty like this, then it would truly be too great. How could Luo Lin keep calm any longer? He carried his spear and didn’t bother to ask about the situation. He said one random phrase about righteousness then immediately stabbed his lance forward with the intention of leaving a huge hole in the evil monk’s chest.</p>
 <p>However, the monk was not easy to mess with. He, with just one kick, made Luo Lin fly outside right into a manure dump to the side.</p>
 <p>When the other Qilin riding soldiers got him out, the monk and the girl were nowhere to be seen. Captain Luo Lin was enraged and, after cleaning his body, he immediately brought people to pursue, which led to the current situation.</p>
 <p>“Something stinks ah! Which person’s mother stepped on dog shit?” Wu Jiu sniffed and let out a shout.</p>
 <p>“Open your eyes and look at your father’s foot ah, I didn’t step on dog shit!” Wang Meng also sniffed and then looked up towards the valiant Luo Lin and exclaimed: “My lord, you can’t be the one that fell down a manure pit, right? Why do you smell so bad like this?”</p>
 <p>Luo Lin’s expression was very ugly. He angrily snorted then gravely said: “You want to die?”</p>
 <p>Lin Luo was the captain of the Qilin War Cavalry and his personal cultivation had reached the early God Base. Even if he killed a few people at this chaotic place, no one would dare to say a word.</p>
 <p>At the moment, he hated anyone who brought up the words “manure pit” the most.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun smilingly asked: “My lord, don’t tell me you actually fell into a manure pit?”</p>
 <p>This time, Luo Lin was really fuming with rage. He tapped the Qilin’s butt with his spear and the gigantic Qilin, like a small mountain, immediately rushed forward.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!”</p>
 <p>Its huge pillar-like legs caused the ground to vibrate as it ferociously rushed forward with its iron soles, wanting to stomp Feng Feiyun into meat paste.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun naturally was not afraid in the least bit. He directly took the horse stance and one hand actively stretched forward to catch the Qilin’s leg while the other hand placed below the Qilin’s stomach and exerted his power to directly lift the entire Qilin up.</p>
 <p>With one throw, the Qilin and Luo Lin directly flew away.</p>
 <p>“Bam!”</p>
 <p>The Qilin bellowed a miserable cry as it fell on the ground!</p>
 <p>Luo Lin was indeed an early God Base cultivator. A green mist appeared below his feet, lifting up his body. Then, he immediately propped backwards with his spear while exerting its full power, creating lightning sparks.</p>
 <p>“It seems that I underestimated you all, try tasting a spear of mine!”</p>
 <p>Before Feng Feiyun could take action, Wang Meng rushed forward first. He waved his thick arms and directly knocked away the spear in Luo Lin’s hand, then he unleashed his iron first, shattering Luo Lin’s body armor.</p>
 <p>“Your father, I don’t like the way you look for a long time now!”</p>
 <p>Wang Meng frantically unleashed fist after fist. Luo Lin wanted to use a powerful energy to shield his body, but it was quickly broken in an instant. His handsome face was beaten into a pig’s head as his teeth fell all over the ground.</p>
 <p>“How bold, daring to beat our captain. He is the son of the Three Mysterious Gate’s sect master.”</p>
 <p>The Qilin War Cavalry’s troops began to rush forward. They bullishly roared with a sky-piercing momentum. Each of them threw out a jade talisman — the size of a palm — with flashing lights, creating countless runes that resulted in a formation.</p>
 <p>They combined to create a formation and attacked together.</p>
 <p>Wang Meng felt the pressure and thus, his skin illuminated a golden brilliance and the muscles on his body completely bulged, almost bursting from his white shirt. One huge golden fist was thrown out with the power to compete against the fourteen jade talismans.</p>
 <p>“Bam!”</p>
 <p>A golden explosive wave flushed out, causing the layer of soil on the plain to be stripped away. A surrounding radius of ten zhang turned into flattened earth.</p>
 <p>The fourteen Qilins suddenly took three steps back, almost throwing the fourteen soldiers off.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was in a complete daze: “Oh heavens ah, this Wang Meng guy has too much power. I can’t believe he almost knocked fourteen Qilins flying. Is this guy a beast transformed into a man?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun currently was at the peak Immortal Foundation realm. Moreover, he could even surpass two small levels to fight. However, his power was absolutely not as devilish as that, unless he used the Infinite Spirit Ring.</p>
 <p>“Motherfucker! This time we are playing in the big leagues. We offended the Godly Martial Army and the Three Mysterious Gate.” Wang Meng let out a strange cry.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun and the four bandits glanced at each other and uttered a cry of horror as they directly ran away, leaving behind the perplexed Qilin soldiers. Who the heck were these people ah? Clearly, each of them were people with powerful strength, why did they just run away? Were they really afraid of the Godly Martial Army and the Three Mysterious Gate’s revenge?</p>
 <p>The most pitiable was Luo Lin. Earlier, he was kicked into a manure pit and, at this moment, he was crazily beaten up by someone into a pig’s head.</p>
 <p>After being helped up by someone, he angrily growled: “Return to Fire Beacon City, I want Father to mince these dogs into paste. I want to report to the City Lord and deploy ten peak God Base knights to kill them. Right, there is also the monk and the little beauty… Ow! It hurts!”</p>
