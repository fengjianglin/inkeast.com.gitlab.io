 <p>“Damned grandma, you should have died in my hands. I, Feng Feiyun, am feeling extremely charitable today, and I will save your life. In the future, if you keep on entangling with me, then I will definitely not show any mercy.”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun grabbed the struggling hands of Dongfang Jingyue, and he moved them behind her head. Then, he started to suck out the corpse poison from her smooth and delicate neck, and he spat out the pitch black poisoned blood to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Feng Feiyun, let me go! I don’t want to be saved by you. If you dare to touch me again, I will risk my life against you!”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue gritted her teeth. The feeling of Feng Feiyun’s lips creeping around her neck made her want to slap him, but at this moment, she didn’t have any strength; she only could let Feng Feiyun’s lips continue to kiss her jade-like neck.</p>
 <p>Yes, this was a kiss — at the very least, she thought so!</p>
 <p>This made her want to vomit…!</p>
 <p>“Don’t move, if I become infected by the corpse poison as well, then both of us will die in this place.”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun’s mouth had been covered by spirit energy, so he was not infected by the corpse poison.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun, once again, sat on her slender waist, and in one “rip” later, he tore off her dudou. He then buried his head in there, and he continued to suck out the poison.</p>
 <p>“Slurp, Slurp!”</p>
 <p>The wound that was infested by corpse poison on her chest was even deeper and longer. If the poison wasn’t sucked out quickly, then her chest would begin to rot all the way to her belly, resulting in death.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, Dongfang Jingyue would rather have her chest corroded to her stomach and die rather than have this low life Feng Feiyun take advantage of her in this situation, at least, from her perspective. This Feng Feiyun was truly a beast out of all beasts. His mouth was even letting off “slurping” sounds; it was as if he was truly intoxicated by the act.</p>
 <p>“Feng Feiyun, I’m telling you that from now on, I will not leave you alone. I will cut out your dirty eyes, cut off your lowly hands, and… and… and your tongue; it must be cut away as well…”</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue didn’t even have the strength to berate someone. Her forehead was filled with sweat, and she was breathing heavily. Her cheeks were blushed red; it was not certain that it was because the poison was being removed from her body, her blood energy became stronger, or from embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“Dongfang Jingyue, who do you think you are? I, Feng Feiyun, could be considered a womanizer, but I will absolutely never consider you. Even if you were standing in front of me, completely naked, I would not touch you once.”</p>
 <p>After Feng Feiyun spat out a mouthful of poison blood to the ground, he covered her chest again with her clothes. No longer riding her waist like a water serpent, he immediately stood up.</p>
 <p>His words were the truth. Even if Dongfang Jingyue was naked to seduce him, he wouldn’t be moved at all. He couldn’t accept a woman who looked so similar to Shui Yueting. The only reason he saved her was because he wanted to make up for the guilt in his heart.</p>
 <p>The corpse poison was all sucked out of her body; her eyes regained their color, and she some spirit; however, because she lost too much blood, her body was still very weak.</p>
 <p>She coldly glared at Feng Feiyun, and then she took a spirit pill out of her chest, placing it in her mouth. She then assumed a meditation pose, and she began to recover her energy.</p>
 <p>It was clear that this spirit pill was not an ordinary one. Even though it was already swallowed, it was still emitting light, resulting in her body being enveloped by its brilliance.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Haotian Spirit Mirror also slowly floated upward to the top of her head, and it protected her with its mirror light. Of course, this was a precaution against Feng Feiyun; she did not trust this shameless beast.</p>
 <p>‘Feng Feiyun! Wait until I recover three tiers of my strength, then I will absolutely kill you in this place.’</p>
 <p>Even though Dongfang Jingyue was not a narrow-minded person, she was definitely a prideful woman. She absolutely would not allow the Feng Feiyun who had tainted her innocence to leave the Mortal Life Cavern alive.</p>
 <p>This would be a scar for the rest of her life. Only by killing Feng Feiyun would she obtain a sense of solace!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Feng Feiyun naturally didn’t know Dongfang Jingyue’s thoughts. He squatted on the ground, and he began to analyze the ancient corpse poison on the ground. The poison that could render a powerful person like Dongfang Jingyue unconscious must be extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>‘If I collect this blood, then use it against elder level characters, I could definitely turn them into a pool of pus and blood within two hours!’</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun took out the jade box that originally stored the True Brilliant Spirit Stone, and he carefully packed the tainted blood inside.</p>
 <p>Having done all of this, Feng Feiyun was very tired. He also sat in a meditation pose to begin to recover his energy.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the river of blood, the shrill screeching of the three monk corpses continued. The mournful tone shook the river, causing ripples to form.</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun and Dongfang Jingyue were meditating next to the blood lake, and they closed their eyes to heal. The screeching had no effect on them.</p>
 <p>Behind them was a scene of black emptiness, and they essentially couldn’t see what was there. There were faint sounds of footsteps, but no one ever walked out. In other words, it was not the footsteps of humans!</p>
 <p>The injury of Feng Feiyun was much lighter than Dongfang Jingyue’s, so his recovery was faster. He stared over at Dongfang Jingyue, who was still healing, and he gazed at her magnificent face that was unmatched in this generation. This kind of beauty, with this kind of temperament, was enough to lure any man’s heart.</p>
 <p>‘No wonder why she always has to wear the veil. This beauty does not belong to the mortal world. If people with lower self-control were to see her, then they would lose their minds instantly.’</p>
 <p>‘Such an alluring face can endlessly captivate others; she is not only beautiful, but she is also proud. With such a face that’s capable of murdering people; if she wasn’t so petty, then Dongfang Jingyue could be reckoned to be the first or second best woman of this generation.’</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue naturally was not a petty woman. If it wasn’t for Feng Feiyun striking her once for no reason, then she wouldn’t be pursuing him. If it wasn’t for Feng Feiyun mistaking her for Shui Yueting again, she wouldn’t hate Feiyun to this extent.</p>
 <p>If Shui Yueting didn’t exist in this world, then there wouldn’t be so many misunderstandings; Feng Feiyun would absolutely fall madly in love with her — this was for certain, and even Feng Feiyun wouldn’t deny this.</p>
 <p>Of course, regarding Feng Feiyun at this moment, Dongfang Jingyue lamented the fact that she couldn’t immediately kill him and drink his blood. The moment her cultivation was restored by one level would be when he would be brought nearer to the gate of death.</p>
 <p>“I gotta get out of this place before she wakes up!”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun removed his gaze from her city-toppling beauty, stood up, and he started striding to the pitch black space.</p>
 <p>There were still faint footsteps in his ears. In the beginning, Feng Feiyun thought that it was his own footsteps but, when he stopped, the footsteps were still ringing.</p>
 <p>It was as if there was someone wandering in the black curtain back and forth!</p>
 <p>In front of him was a never disappearing darkness, and it was like there were layers of black mists covering his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Who on earth are you, come out!”</p>
 <p>The Immortal Foundation within Feng Feiyun’s dantian exuded wave after wave of godly senses, and the energy in his entire body was channeled; he was ready to make a move at any time.</p>
 <p>“Who are you, come out…?”</p>
 <p>“Who are you, come out…!”</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Besides the echoes — along with the footsteps — in his ears, there was no one else appearing.</p>
 <p>“Pretending to be gods and devils, show yourself!”</p>
 <p>Two flames rose up in Feng Feiyun’s pupils. The Heavenly Phoenix Gaze burst out a shooting light towards the darkness. This scene caused him to frighteningly jump, and he couldn’t help but take several steps back.</p>
 <p>This was an extremely shocking scene!</p>
 <p>In front of his eyes was an empty space with a ruined temple that was suspended in the air. It was unknown for how many years this temple had been abandoned, but the walls and the broken rooftops were covered with spider webs.</p>
 <p>This temple was extremely huge. There were buddhist chambers, pagodas, and a courtyard planted with great towering trees, but, because it had been buried for many years under the earth, the trees were already dead, bare, and austere.</p>
 <p>Of course, the thing that really frightened Feng Feiyun was not the ancient temple underground, but the monks walking back and forth inside the ancient temple. These monks had died for who-knows-how-many thousand years, but they were still holding their buddhist beads. They seemed to be chanting, but there was no sound of chants.</p>
 <p>The ancient monk corpses inside this ancient temple numbered around one thousand. Each of them was enveloped in a thick muderous aura; they were definitely not any weaker than the three ancient monk corpses that were chasing Dongfang Jingyue earlier.</p>
 <p>If these ancient monk corpses in this underground temple were to run rampant outside, then it would be an earth-shattering calamity. The entire Grand Southern Prefecture, or even the entire Jin Dynasty, may no longer exist.</p>
 <p>‘It seems like they are imprisoned by something, and they simply couldn’t escape from this broken temple.’</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was slightly relieved. If these ancient monk corpses truly rushed outside, then there would absolutely be no one that could stop them.</p>
 <p>“Feng Feiyun, you still dare to escape? I want to see where you will run to today?”</p>
 <p>The voice of Dongfang Jingyue rang about and became increasingly closer. She had chased to here and swore to not let this go without killing Feng Feiyun!</p>
 <p>“Damned grandma, don’t come over here! Do you want to die?”</p>
 <p>Feng Feiyun was angered to the point where he started cursing.</p>
 <p>Dongfang Jingyue naturally wouldn’t believe his nonsense, so, after hearing his plead, she smiled instead:</p>
 <p>“Today, even if you have wings, you wouldn’t be able to fly away!”</p>
