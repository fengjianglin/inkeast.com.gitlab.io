 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An was thoroughly intrigued.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just how beautiful is this Qiu Honglei that she can drive so many men crazy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no need to talk about that old pervert Ji Dengtu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even Chu Hongcai, this habitually aloof and quiet man, seemed completely smitten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them made haste towards the Immortal Abode. Even though Zu An had never ridden a horse before, he could just learn by watching the others. He was a cultivator after all, so maintaining his balance wasn’t too difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along the way, Chu Hongcai and Chu Yucheng kepty trying to find chances to ask him about Chu Chuyan’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An was fully aware of their attempts, and he bluffed his way through them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, they arrived at a street filled with a mysterious fragrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Yucheng winked at Zu An, but his small eyes, set within his excessively chubby face, made it difficult to notice. “New Apsara Lane has far more than just the Immortal Abode! This street has over a hundred different brothels. It is a man’s paradise, not only in name but also in reality!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Over a hundred?” Zu An was completely stupefied. Brightmoon City had such a big market for this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Brightmoon City was a large city, it still paled in comparison to the international metropolises of his past world. Most of the people were also poor commoners without much disposable income. Were there really enough customers to support this level of business?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Hongcai spoke, his face filled with pride.“This is why I say you are lacking in culture. Brightmoon City is a well-known and bustling city, and it serves as the commercial hub for the nearby commanderies. This place even produces salt and steel, and is a populous city well-known to all the rich and famous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not only does Brightmoon City have a huge population, it is also crisscrossed by an endless stream of trade routes from many different places. This has caused all sorts of professions to spring up and grow, creating the bountiful beacon of prosperity that is Brightmoon City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His explanation gave Zu An a rough understanding. This place was like Ancient China’s Yangzhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a hundred thousand coins strung up by the thousands, we ride a crane to Yangzhou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a place that many ancient people had yearned for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brightmoon City was experiencing a similar boom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes scanned the street, and sure enough, he saw brightly colored buildings of all different shapes and colors. There were many girls in skimpy clothing that exposed half their bodies. Some of them covered their mouths while giggling, and others were bold and unconstrained… their methods for attracting customers were as varied and miraculous as the eight immortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Yucheng took a deep breath and said with an intoxicated voice, “Even the air is filled with the sweet aroma of seduction! This fragrance must be the sweet scent of all the ladies here. This place really is the paradise of men after all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An couldn’t help but remark, “Are you sure that it isn’t just the smell of cosmetics?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fatty normally seemed rather polite and adorable. Who would have thought that he would be such an experienced veteran in this field?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Yucheng felt like he’d been strangled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had felt hot blood surging within him, and the words of fiery passion roaring within him were ready to set the whole place ablaze. However, Zu An’s comment had caused him to choke, and all his words died in his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An used this chance to take in his surroundings more deeply. Even though this New Apsara Lane was full of brothels, the most eye-catching place here was definitely the Immortal Abode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tall building with several floors, it rose steeply from the ground. In terms of design and scale, it far exceeded the other brothels around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason Zu An noticed this building wasn’t because of its rich ornamentation, of which every detail would have been praised in his previous world as a shining example of ancient cultural heritage. Nor was it because of the flamboyant calligraphy with which the establishment’s glorious name, ‘Immortal Abode’, was depicted on a plaque above the main entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because of the ocean of human flesh that had already gathered around the entrance. Amidst the sea of people, many were screaming the name of Qiu Honglei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An was completely stupefied. This scene was playing out exactly as if some celebrity had appeared in a downtown area in his previous world. Qiu Honglei hadn’t even shown herself yet, so who knew what these people were hollering about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can none of these people be aware that this goddess they are so crazy about will end up as a mere plaything for the strong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good thing we came early! There aren't too many people here yet.” Chu Hongcai sounded pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An blinked at the mass of people in front of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bro, what’s wrong with your eyes?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing Zu An’s confusion, Chu Yucheng explained with a chuckle, “These people are only here because they enjoy a good commotion. They don’t actually have the qualifications to enter the Immortal Abode. Second brother Hongcai isn’t wrong—we can still be considered among the early arrivals. It seems like we can grab some good seats today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he squeezed his way through the ground. His body was thick, at least twice as wide as a normal person’s. This fellow had been a tank in the Clans Tournament, so he had no trouble moving through these ordinary people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Yucheng’s chubby palm pushed forward, and the people in front of him staggered out of the way like drunks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His actions drew curses from those he offended, but when they realized his strength, not a single one dared to go beyond hurling a few tough words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing all these people around him, Zu An’s eyes began to twitch. These were all living sacks of Rage points! How could he let them go so easily? He began to yell loudly, “Losers, please move out of the way. You all can’t even go in, so why are all of you crowding around here blindly? You’re just blocking the way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though none of them had heard of the word ‘loser’ before, it wasn’t hard to infer that it was a derogatory term. The crowd were quick learners, and in short order, all of them became furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Loser A for 99 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Loser B for 99 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Loser C for 99 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An sighed in satisfaction at the influx of Rage points. How pitiful, his Keyboard System didn’t even find these side characters important enough to be named.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Yucheng continuously wiped the sweat off his brow as he kept a keen eye on the swarm of people around them. His chubby body sweated easily, but he knew that the sweat he was currently producing definitely came from the anxiety stirred up in him by the fellow behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Hongcai followed him, gripping his sword tightly. Even though their cultivation was far greater than these people around them, he knew there was no way they could stand against so many of them together, especially since many of these people were cultivators themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them rattled off a constant stream of curses under their breath. There really was something wrong with this guy’s head! Just what did the first miss see in him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Chi Hongcai for 222 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Chu Yucheng for 222 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, they managed to squeeze their way to the entrance. The guards from the Immortal Abode stepped in to assist, holding back the furious crowd for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A young man yelled out from somewhere in the crowd, “Tsk, do you all think you’re all that just because you’ve got a bit of money? Do you think that it gives you the right to do whatever you want?” His voice was dripping with disgust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard this, Zu An stopped in his tracks. He turned around and flashed the youngster a wide smile. “We’re going in right now, but all of you can only watch stupidly from outside. Sorry, but money talks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He even shrugged a perfect textbook shrug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Loser A for 199 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Loser B for 199 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You have successfully trolled Loser C for 199 Rage points!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing even more Rage points pour in than before, Zu An almost orgasmed. He finally understood why villains always loved saying such cheesy, scripted lines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It really feels so damned good!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He giggled as he put his arms around Chu Hongcai and Chu Yucheng. “You guys definitely have to bring me to more lively places like this in the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wouldn’t obtain many Rage points even if he bent over backwards trying to farm points off a single person. Meanwhile, just a random holler here had gotten him over ten thousand points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure, sure…” Chu Yucheng took out a handkerchief to mop up the sweat on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ll have to be batshit crazy to invite you out again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guards from the Immortal Abode were afraid that he would start a riot, so they quickly led the trio inside in a hurried and flustered manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they entered the establishment proper, Zu An’s eyes were immediately drawn to the gleaming, crystalline river not too far away. Only now did he realize that the Immortal Abode was constructed along the bank of the Brightmoon River.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He even noticed some pleasure boats by the riverbank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aren’t there already enough brothels here? Why are there still so many pleasure craft?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people in this city really know how to play…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An sighed. It seemed he still lacked imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How many silver taels did you have to spend to meet with this Qiu Honglei?” Zu An noticed that his two companions had fished out exquisite invitation cards, and the guards smoothly let them through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Entering actually doesn’t require any money. Immortal Abode has sent out invitations to all of the well known figures in Brightmoon City, as well as all other respectable figures. Each invitation allows one to bring a companion. As for your expenses afterwards, that will depend on how hard you play.” Chu Yucheng wiggled his brows, giving him a knowing look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is this damn fatty looking more and more like that actor Qiao Shan?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An thought jokingly. Then, he suddenly realized what the other party said, and immediately became upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Abode had issued an invitation to all respectable figures. If even the juniors of the side branches, Chu Yucheng and Chu Hongcai, were given one, where was his damn invitation?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Were they looking down on him?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Immortal Abode can eat shit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately turned to leave, his face as dark as a storm cloud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah Zu, what’s wrong?” Chu Yucheng was shocked by this, and hurried over to check on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An said with a snort, “This Immortal Abode has the nerve to not send me an invitation. They clearly don’t give a shit about me! Why do I have to show them warmth when all they show me is their callousness? That whatever pretty courtesan or whatever, can she be as attractive as my wife? Forget it, forget it, I might as well go home to embrace my wife.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard his words, the people in the hall all turned to look at him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just which idiot was saying such things? He actually dared to claim that Lady Qiu isn’t as pretty as his wife?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is his wife a goddess?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These men had all been worried that they might not have the chance to show themselves off before Qiu Honglei. Now, an opportunity had come knocking on their doors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you a shameless fool? Your wife…” Several of the men closest to him jumped to their feet, about to pummel the idiot who had dared slander their goddess. However, when they saw Zu An’s face, they immediately looked like they had eaten a mouthful of shit. The rest of their words slinked back down their throats. “Apologies, we’ve disturbed you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow’s wife really was prettier than Qiu Honglei. After all, Chu Chuyan was publicly acknowledged as the number one beauty in Brightmoon City! No matter how pretty Qiu Honglei was, her standing was still incomparable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a private room on the second floor, a pretty young heir watched this scene through the curtains, and scoffed, “Not a trace of elegance! A complete rascal! I really don’t know what Chu Chuyan sees in him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice was gentle and pleasant to the ear. Despite the generous dollop of anger, the words had the precise and unhurried cadence befitting a simple yet elegant scholar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reply, another man with delicate features said with a bitter smile, “Sis, you cannot let yourself be deceived by his outward appearance. There is definitely more to him than meets the eye. Beneath his wanton and unrestrained exterior is a cool-headed and crafty mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Zu An were here, he would have definitely recognized this person as none other than the city lord’s young master Xue Xiu, while the pretty heir was actually his older sister, dressed as a man.</span></p>
