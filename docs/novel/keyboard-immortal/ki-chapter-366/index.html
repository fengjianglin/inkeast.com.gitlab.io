She had never expected it to be this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other party seized this chance to whip out a bamboo pipe. He blew out a blast of pink mist into her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Qin Wanru instantly held her breath, it was still too late. She smelled a sweet scent, and instantly became dizzy. She backed away from him in a few quick steps. “What sort of drug did you use?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person wasn’t in a hurry to leave either. Instead, he slowly walked over to her from the window, his face lit by the moonlight and the soft glow of the candles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two dark circles ringing his eyes were especially clear. He was the head of the Chu clan’s second branch, Chu Tiesheng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The name of the drug is Bull’s Cream. It gets its name from the fact that only the milk of a bull can neutralize its effects.” Chu Tiesheng’s breathing grew ragged. He hadn’t expected to reveal all of his cards at once, and he couldn’t contain his anxiety as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What rubbish is that? How can you obtain milk from a bull?!” Qin Wanru deliberately raised her voice. She began to wonder why no guards had appeared, despite all the noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Tiesheng laughed. “Indeed, bulls cannot be milked. As such, there is no antidote for this drug. Only the joining of a man and woman can eliminate its effects.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An aphrodisiac!” Qin Wanru’s face immediately paled. “Chu Tiesheng, I never knew you harbored such shameless thoughts towards me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shameless?” Chu Tiesheng’s expression became cold. “How can this be shameless? A beautiful woman belongs to a noble man, after all. I refuse to believe that you’ve never sensed my intentions after all these years!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru roared in fury. “Absolutely disgraceful! I am your sister-in-law! It’s normal for feelings to develop between men and women, but you should know when to show restraint!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister-in-law?” Chu Tiesheng sneered. “There’s a common saying—nothing is tastier than dumplings, and nothing is more fun than a sister-in-law.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru stared at him in horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you gone mad? The Chu clan is currently facing an unprecedented crisis. We cannot afford an internal conflict right now! I can pretend that nothing happened if you apologize and admit your wrongdoing immediately!” Qin Wanru was so angry that her entire body was shaking. However, her rational mind told her that it would be unwise for her to make a move right then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Tiesheng laughed. “Isn’t the Chu clan in its current predicament precisely because of Chu Zhongtian’s stubbornness? If the Chu clan continues under his leadership, it’ll only be a matter of time before the Chu clan meets its end! Everything I am doing is for the sake of rescuing the Chu clan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru’s heart sank. It dawned on her that things were definitely not as simple as she thought. “Are you planning to rebel?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The seat of clan master of the Chu clan should obviously belong to the most competent person. Since Chu Zhongtian is leading the clan towards a collapse, why shouldn’t I take his place?” Chu Tiesheng was in no rush. The longer he stalled, the more the poison would spread through her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru was at the sixth rank, after all. If they fought on even terms, he might not be able to win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just how many people are in on this? Did you incite the third branch to rebel as well?” Qin Wanru demanded. She wanted to find out just how bad this rebellion was right now. She wanted to know if this was a rebellion by a single party, or if the second and third branches were conspiring together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Tiesheng snickered. “At least you have some self-awareness. You know that you’ve let down the other branches, which is why you have such a guilty conscience.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru felt her body heating up. She couldn’t help but loosen her collar. She knew that remaining here wasn’t a sensible choice, but she needed to know more. “Hmph! The two of you have always harbored uncontrollable ambitions. Anyone could see that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can a human being not have ambition?” Chu Tiesheng walked towards her slowly, one step at a time. “Wanru, could it be that you still want to save Chu Zhongtian? There is no harm in telling you this. He won’t be coming back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru was stunned. She wasn’t stupid—she picked up on his meaning immediately. “You colluded with Sang Hong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Tiesheng brought his palms together. “Lord Sang is working for the emperor. I am merely going along with the flow by cooperating with him. How can this be called collusion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not even the slickest tongue can hide your despicable nature.” Qin Wanru rubbed her forehead. Her temperature was climbing, and she was starting to feel dizzy. She didn’t know how much longer she could hold out for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The winner is the one who is right. I won’t argue pointlessly with you anymore.” Chu Tiesheng fished out a bottle from an inner pocket. His expression grew more and more malicious. “Sister-in-law, do you know how much I’ve thought about you, every day and night? Yet, I could never obtain you. I had no choice but to seek out other methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is something I found a while back. It’s called ‘Worries-Be-Gone’. Take this, and you’ll forget everything that has happened within several hours. When I first got this, I planned to find a chance to overpower you, knowing that everything would be back to normal the day after. You wouldn’t remember a thing… The next time I wanted you, I’d make you use it again. This way, you’ll be all mine, and we’d even be able to keep it quiet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru’s countenance changed drastically when she heard his deranged murmurings. How could such a vile drug exist in this world? There was no way she would be able to die in peace if she was given such a drug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the end, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. It wouldn’t have been any fun if I was the only one who remembered what happened. I didn’t want you to continue being so proud and arrogant, looking at me with those eyes filled with scorn. I want you to remember every single detail about what happens between us!” Chu Tiesheng’s eyes grew slightly bloodshot. His breathing hastened. “That’s why I continued searching, and I eventually found this ‘Bull’s Cream’. This is a miraculous drug, on par with the ‘Eighteen Spring Winds’! It can turn even a virgin into an absolute slut, and only the milk of a bull can neutralize its effects. But where would you get milk from a bull? You know what other white substance is needed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shameless!” Qin Wanru didn’t dare remain any longer. His words were becoming more and more despicable, and her condition was deteriorat. She yelled out a curse and charged towards the exit. However, Chu Tiesheng was already prepared for this. He moved to block her path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Wanru seemed to have become weaker after being exposed to the drug. Her speed had decreased dramatically, and she couldn’t get past him at all.</span></p>

She was worried that he would force her to the ground.</span></p>

Who would’ve thought that the tides would turn so quickly?” Chu Tiesheng had a smug smile on his face. “What’s the rush? I still have so many good things to show you.”</span></p>

However, she was also worried that, if she did so, he would seize the chance to restrain her. She was at a loss as to what to do.</span></p>

It was black and round. “This is a recording stone that I obtained with great difficulty. It will be able to record everything that happens here. I can replay the recording at any time in the future.</span></p>

She charged at him, hoping to kill the disgusting brute in front of her before the drug could spread through her body fully.</span></p>

It merely served to speed up the effects of the drug. He easily dodged her attacks. “Sister-in-law, don’t be in such a rush! There are actually two paths you can choose from. The first is exactly what I described. If you oppose me, I’ll use force to acquire you. Then, I’ll show Chu Zhongtian everything.</span></p>

I will even agree to help you safeguard Chu Zhongtian’s life. You can continue to be a duchess, but only on the condition that you accompany me wherever I go. This is quite a favorable deal for you, don’t you think?</span></p>

Outsiders might not know about the issues within the Chu clan, but how could I not know? The two of you have always desperately wanted a son, and yet you’ve only managed to give birth to daughters after all these years. In the last ten years, the two of you haven’t even been able to give birth to another daughter. I’ve struggled so hard to understand why this would be. A beautiful wife like you shouldn’t be cast aside until you’ve had a whole litter of children!</span></p>

You’re in the prime of your life, yet you’ve been neglected for so many years. Surely you have your own needs and desires as well?”</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone! New month, new updates!</p>
 <p>The previous release schedule was quite uncomfortable for many of our readers in the states, so I bumped it up by 12 hours. Hopefully, those of the F5 sect will be able to make a breakthrough soon because of this change :D</p>
 <p>For those of you who are willing to support the novel, there will be more sponsored chapters available soon!</p>
 <p>Thank you all for supporting this novel. Happy reading!</p>
