 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An thought about Jiang Luofu’s long and shapely legs, and he subconsciously answered, “Skin color~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Suo gulped down a mouthful of saliva. “As expected of my goddess. Ahh, I’m so jealous of you. You were able to meet her twice despite having just arrived a few days ago. I haven’t even gotten a chance to meet her once thus far!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An burst into laughter. “You’re so obsessed with her even though you have never met her before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t understand. Distance makes the heart grows fonder. From the moment I caught a glimpse of her on the street, I was already captured by the charms. My heart and body belong to her,” said the lovestruck Wei Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An shook his head in disdain.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heart and body, my ass. Like she would be interested in your body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Speaking of which, who is this teacher who keeps putting on airs?” Zu An took this opportunity to scout intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected of a true gossip master, Wei Suo was able to immediately provide Zu An with an answer, “His name is Yang Wei, Brightmoon City’s Civil Affairs Administrator. He’s in charge of collecting agricultural taxes in the city. At the same time, he’s also our arithmetic teacher too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ohhh, arithmetic teacher,” murmured Zu An contemplatively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zu An, get up and stand at the back of the classroom!” Yang Wei suddenly bellowed from the podium all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was like a sudden thunderous rumble, jolting awake many students who had just barely fallen asleep once more. They nearly peed their pants from the scare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What the hell are you up to? Can’t a student get proper sleep now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone turned to look at Zu An, curious to know just what kind of tyrannical deed had he done to make the teacher so angry. By this point, there were actually a few people who were already quite impressed with him. Ever since this fellow enrolled in the academy a few days ago, he had been barging into trouble after trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had only been several minutes since the class started, but the teacher had already shouted at him twice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An frowned. He knew that Yang Wei was hostile toward him, but he didn’t expect the latter to act up so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you deaf? Didn’t you hear me telling you to stand at the back of the classroom?” Yang Wei walked down from the podium to glare at Zu An with a darkened face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An sneered coldly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You aren’t even offering me any Rage points at all; it’s obvious that your anger is feigned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, he replied leisurely, “If I may ask, why are you punishing me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Instead of paying attention in class, you start chatting with your neighboring classmate instead. Tell me, should I not punish you for that?” Yang Wei spoke with an air of haughtiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the privilege of being of higher standing. If a teacher was determined to punish a student, he could easily find an excuse to do it, and no one could fault him on it. Besides, Zu An hadn’t been listening to the lesson, which spared Yang Wei the trouble of having to think of an excuse to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An’s eyebrows shot up. One must know that the Yellow class was filled with the worst students in the academy. There was hardly anyone paying attention to class. Based on what he saw earlier, a third of them were sleeping and a third of them were chatting. There were even a couple of them secretly playing cards at the back of the classroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instead of dealing with those, he chooses to come after me instead…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An didn’t even turn to look at Wei Suo earlier so as to avoid giving Yang Wei a reason to flare up, but as it turned out, it didn’t make a difference at all. Since the latter was determined to deal with him, he shouldn’t blame him for retaliating accordingly then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher, I’m afraid that I don’t understand what you’re saying. I’ve been listening intently all this while, and I haven’t talked to anyone. Do you have any evidence to prove that I haven’t been paying attention?” asked Zu An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei fell speechless at the rebuttal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought that it would be easy for him to deal with a mere student—he just had to find a reason to punish him before blowing up the matter to have him expelled from school. As long as he lost the protection of the academy, those lords would be able to deal with him much easier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, who could have thought that Zu An would actually talk back to him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the significance of the academies in this world, there was a great focus on respecting the teachers. It was completely unprecedented in the history of the academy for a student to talk back to a teacher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this turn of affairs might be to his advantage instead. He was still struggling to find a legitimate excuse to have Zu An expelled. After all, he was just an ordinary teacher. It was still possible for him to dish out punishments to students, but having them expelled went beyond the scope of his authority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if Zu An were to disregard etiquette and openly challenge him, he could make use of this to drive him out of the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I saw you chatting away with the person seated next to you. Are you telling me that my eyes are playing tricks on me?” Yang Wei harrumphed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response, Zu An pointed out sharply, “If you saw the two of us chatting with one another, shouldn’t you call out the two of us together? Why did you only point me out then? It can’t be that a respected teacher is picking on one of his students, can it?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An burst out laughing. “Oh? That sure is weird. I don’t recall introducing myself when I walked in earlier. I’ve only enrolled in this academy a few days ago, and this is my first lesson with you. Yet, you actually knew who I am… I can’t help but think that you’re intentionally picking on me right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other students in the eyes also began narrowing their eyes. None of them were fools. There was indeed something weird going on here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While none of them was fond of Zu An, their feeling of detest toward the teachers was far greater. This was especially so for scrawny middle-aged men who combed their hair into an awful center parting like Yang Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If teachers were really intentionally picking on students, wouldn’t that mean that they could possibly be next?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all eyes suddenly centered on him, Yang Wei found himself feeling rather uncomfortable. He quickly clarified, “Who in Brightmoon City hasn’t heard of you, Zu An? You got into a conflict with a fifth rank senior, and you gambled in the Silverhook Casino and won 7,500,000 silver taels. How could I possibly be oblivious to who you are?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I nearly fell into his trap!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei had long heard that Zu An had a sharp mouth, but he didn’t think that the latter would actually be this formidable. He reminded himself to keep his guard up so that he wouldn’t be done in like Mei Chaofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An nodded lightly as he continued speaking, “Well, even if you do know me, I wasn’t talking earlier. As a teacher, you shouldn’t slander your own students.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rubbish! I saw you chatting with your neighboring classmate with my own eyes! Do you think that I, as a teacher, would wrong you?” It was just a moment ago that Yang Wei was happy that he didn’t have to pin a false accusation on Zu An, but who could have thought that the latter would start lying outright?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s hard to say. As they say, a huge jungle has all kinds of weird birds.” As Yang Wei was already openly hostile to him, Zu An didn’t think that there was a need to hold himself back. “Since you said that I was chatting with my neighboring classmate, why don’t you present some evidence then? Otherwise, I’ll have to sue you for defamation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +666 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei nearly fainted from anger. He had always been the one to point fingers at others and accuse them of false charges. This was the one time that he caught a person in the midst of wrongdoing, but ironically, he found himself unable to punish him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How the hell am I supposed to find evidence for this? It’s not like there’s a recorder around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have evidence, right?” However, Yang Wei was unwilling to give up just like this. He turned to Wei Suo and asked sternly, “Speak, did you talk to him earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Suo blinked his eyes innocently. “Teacher, I didn’t.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An secretly shot Wei Suo a thumbs up. He was still thinking of reminding the latter not to give him away, but it seemed like he was a person who knew how to read the room.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young lad, you have potential!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I…” Yang Wei was so angry that he found himself at a loss of words.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The academy’s culture is really getting worse. Each batch of students is worse than the previous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Yang Wei had come prepared. He wouldn’t trip over something as minor as this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hah, all you have is your mouth. I shall show you the absolute difference between us!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei took a deep breath to calm himself down before proceeding on, “You claim that you have been earnestly listening to my lesson earlier. In other words, you should be familiar with what I’ve just taught you, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many students felt that Yang Wei was being unreasonable here. In the first place, arithmetic was not a simple subject. Even if a student was earnestly listening to the lesson, it was unlikely that he would fully understand what was being taught right away. By this point, it was already clear as day that Yang Wei was picking on Zu An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of the students felt spurred to speak up on Zu An’s behalf—they were still in the hot-blooded phase of their life, after all. However, to their horror, Zu An actually went along Yang Wei without any hesitation, “Indeed. The content you are going through is too easy for me. There’s no way I could possibly not know it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This world had the additional mystical element of cultivation, but when it came to other fields of study, it was far lacking behind that of the modern world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who do you think I am? I’m a university student who has been through the torture of the National College Entrance Examination! Your arithmetic questions are a child’s play to me!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Yang Wei was delighted to hear Zu An’s response.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You could have chosen to back down, but your arrogance got ahead of yourself!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my first time seeing such an arrogant student! Very well, I’ll come up with 20 questions. As long as you can answer any of them correctly… No, I mean three of them correctly, I’ll believe that you weren’t lying. How does that sound?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was confident that Zu An wouldn’t be able to answer even one of them correctly, but when he thought about the incident at Silverhook Casino, he felt that there was a need for him to be a little more conservative. Perhaps, Zu An might be able to get one right by some stroke of luck, but there was no way he could answer all three correctly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching as everything unfolded, Wei Suo couldn’t help but feel deeply worried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei’s arithmetic class was known to be hard. When it came to other subjects, the students could still try to get by through memorization, but the same trick didn’t apply to arithmetic. There was once Yang Wei set the questions a little harder than usual, and everyone ended up flunking the test. Given that Yang Wei was intentionally picking on Zu An this time around, he was bound to set the hardest questions. It was unlikely that anyone in the class would be able to answer any of them at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Suo was going to warn Zu An about it, but the latter had already accepted the challenge. “Sure, sound fine to me. However, what if I manage to answer all of the questions correctly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Answer all of the questions correctly?” Yang Wei burst into laughter, as if he had heard the most hilarious joke in the world. “If you can get all of them correctly, I’ll resign from the academy and let you take over my position!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An’s eyes lit up. “It’s a deal then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Deal!” Yang Wei sneered coldly, wondering if Zu An was out of his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did you think that the questions I set would be easy? As a Civil Affairs Administrator handling taxes, I have been dealing with arithmetic for decades now! With my experience, I reckon that there no one in the entire prefecture who can surpass me in this field!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That fool must have only seen the papers I have set in the past. Let me tell you this… I have actually been dumbing down the questions for the sake of the students! I shall go all out this time around and show you how terrifying arithmetic can be!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if you can’t answer three questions correctly then?” Yang Wei looked at Zu An provocatively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’re willing to put your career in the academy on the line, it’s only fair that I do the same too. If I’m unable to answer three questions correctly, I’ll leave the academy on my own accord,” replied Zu An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei was overjoyed to hear that.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You sure jumped straight right into my trap! Since that’s the case, don’t blame me then!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing the tense atmosphere between the two of them, the students of the Yellow class began getting fired up. Regardless of which world one was in, the crowd always loved commotion. Besides, there were hardly any students in the Yellow class who were interested in studying in the first place. To them, gambling was much more fun and productive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, they began gathering closer to take a closer look.</span></p>
