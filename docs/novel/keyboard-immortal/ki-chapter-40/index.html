 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man didn’t lose his temper at Zu An’s words. Instead, he closed his fan and chuckled softly. “I can offer you some pointers if you want to. I am Xie Xiu. May I know what your name is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am Zu An.” Zu An thought that the man’s name was really reflective of his appearance—he sure was a suave man. <a href="#footnote_1" id="footnote_ref_1">[1]</a></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Your name sounds familiar. I seem to have heard it somewhere before,” Xie Xiu placed his fan beneath his chin as he spoke contemplatively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An was just about to respond when Cheng Shouping waved his hand at him and called out, “Young master, it’s going to be your turn soon. Come over!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An clasped his fist at Xie Xiu and said, “Brother Xie, if a chance arises, I hope to learn the art of how to become a scu… Pui pui pui! I mean, the art of courtship from you in the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You seem to be a fellow peer. Of course, I welcome you to do so,” Xie Xiu clasped his fist and replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An quickly returned back to the queue. In front of him, Hong Xingying sneered coldly and said, “Birds of the same feather flock together. People like you can only make friends like that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An shrugged nonchalantly. “What a pity that it’s a person like me who ended up marrying the goddess of your dreams.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Xingying immediately lost his temper. “You dare to insult the First Miss?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +321 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An chuckled in response. “We’re a married couple. How could this be considered an insult?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!!!” Hong Xingying was so angry that he was about to draw his sword on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for +344 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was then that a staff of the academy knocked on the door and shouted, “What are you causing a ruckus for? Those who dare to cause trouble will be immediately stripped of their qualifications as a student!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the face of such a threat, Hong Xingying could only put aside his anger and turn his head to the front. He thought that it would be a huge loss if he were to ruin his own future over a wastrel like Zu An.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just wait till I accrue some accomplishments in the academy. I shall free myself from the position of a servant, and I won’t have to hold back anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Zu An felt that it was a pity that they were stopping here. He shook his head in disappointment before turning his attention to Cheng Shouping. “What’s the background of that man named Xie Xiu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Shouping replied, “He’s the Second Young Master of the City Lord Estate.” Then, he leaned a little closer and continued with a hushed voice, “He’s a renowned wastrel in the Brightmoon City. He’s well-versed in zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting, practically dabbling in everything. Be it eating, drinking, whoring, or gambling, there’s nothing that he wouldn’t do. However, his cultivation appears to be his weak point. Due to that, his father is at a loss as to what he should do with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like you, young master,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Cheng Shouping silently added in his heart. But soon, he shook his head in rebuttal.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How can our young master compete with him? This Second Young Master Xie is at least proficient in so many skills!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A wastrel? Interesting!” Zu An noticed that Xie Xiu had just approached another woman, and the latter, noticing his gaze, nodded slightly in acknowledgment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Next, Wei Suo!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Zu An was just about to wave to Xie Xiu from afar when he heard the voice of the staff and widened his eyes in surprise. He never thought that he would hear such a refreshing name in this world. <a href="#footnote_2" id="footnote_ref_2">[2]</a></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned his gaze over, only to see a young man of smaller stature stepping forward. He had an appearance that looked reminiscent of a sneaky rat, especially with the two buckteeth he had. His appearance gave him the impression of a cunning man who wouldn’t hesitate to do all sorts of underhanded things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wow, his parents must be prophets to actually give him such a fitting name!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An noticed the academy’s staff taking out a crystal ball. The staff pricked Wei Suo’s finger and squeezed out a droplet of his blood onto the crystal ball. The crystal ball emanated a dim glow that would have been hardly visible if one wasn’t paying close attention to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lower Ding.”</span><br><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">(Equivalent to D-)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Suo was initially looking at the crystal ball with eyes filled with anticipation, only for his excitement to deflate like a leaking balloon upon hearing the result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An was confused by the set of procedures. He turned to Cheng Shouping and asked, “What are they doing over there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Shouping quickly explained, “They are testing the students’ aptitude for cultivation. All students who seek to enter the academy must go through this process. The classes they will be assigned to, as well as the cultivation resources they will be allocated with, will be determined by the results of this test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An was truly amazed. “Little Pingping, how is it that you have an answer to every question I ask?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Shouping stuck his chest out proudly and spoke gleefully, “Of course! As a qualified study companion, it’s only right for me to find out such details beforehand!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An patted Cheng Shouping’s head, but deep inside, he was starting to worry a little. He didn’t think that he would have to go through an aptitude test in order to enter the academy. Given how many Marrow Cleansing Pills he had eaten, his talent should be maxed out by now. Would the result of his test blow the minds of everyone here?</span></p>

He perfectly carried out all of the missions that the old master and old mistress assigned to him, no matter how tiring or difficult they were. Just looking at the ravishing profile of the First Miss from afar was enough for him to feel that his efforts were all worth it.</span></p>

He hoped that she could find a capable man from an outstanding background that was worthy of her, and he thought that he would be satisfied with that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To his delight, the Chu clan had chosen to draft in a son-in-law for the First Miss. It went without saying that those of distinguished standing wouldn’t lower themselves to become a drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan, so those who participated in the selections were lesser nobles and ordinary civilians. As such, he thought that his chance had come.</span></p>

Everyone around him congratulated him as if it was already decided. While he maintained a nonchalant face, in truth, flowers were already blooming in his heart as if his spring had arrived. It was no wonder why the First Miss would direct a faint smile at him from time to time; it turned out that she was interested in him too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just thinking about how the beautiful and lofty First Miss would soon become his wife, and that he would be able to embrace her fragrant and soft body to sleep every night made him giggle in his sleep.</span></p>

The First Miss actually chose a renowned wastrel as her husband instead. When he heard the news, he fell from cloud nine down to the pits of despair. He became the laughingstock of those around him.</span></p>

He was just a servant in the Chu Estate, so it had never crossed the mind of the First Miss to think of him as a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he begged his father to use his connections to get him into Brightmoon Academy. If he did well there, there was a chance that he could become an official and build up his own clan. By then, he would be able to stand on equal terms with the First Miss and have her notice him as a man.</span></p>
