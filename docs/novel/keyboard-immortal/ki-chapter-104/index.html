 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Kun rubbed his eyes, fearing that he was seeing things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many people who shared the same thought as him. Almost every single student in the room was staring at Zu An with eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did that fellow make his hairdo? It looks pretty cool. Should I give it a try someday too? Also, what’s with the music? It really makes my heart pump fast,” murmured Xie Xiu softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now that I’m taking a closer look at him, he’s actually quite good-looking. He looks much more imposing in this dress-up than his casual look,” added Zheng Dan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why does this fellow look much more pleasing to me than before? My gosh, I must be going mad!” Wu Qing harrumphed coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan also only started to recover from the initial shock at this point. She realized that she really wasn’t seeing things and that the person on the podium was no other than her husband. Even with her usual cold personality, she felt her face burning up. Had there been a hole right beside her, she might have just leaped in without a second’s hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing?!” She transmitted her voice secretly to Zu An anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An shot a glance at her, but he didn’t respond to her question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan bit her lips and carried on, “Stop messing around and go back!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had never felt so embarrassed in her entire life before. All her life, she had always been the one in control. Even in the academy, she was a lofty existence that no one dared to mess with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this very moment, she felt like she was sitting on a bed of needles. She felt like everyone was directing weird stares at her, waiting to make a laughingstock of the Chu clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Zu An had already gotten into position and had turned over to face the students before him. Upon noticing the furiously blushing Chu Chuyan, he put on a stern expression and said, “That student over there, please be reminded that we’re having a class over here. You should stop sending messages secretly to your teacher in the midst of the lesson.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ohh~”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A commotion broke out within the class as they figured that Zu An was addressing Chu Chuyan over here. Considering their married status, it didn’t take a genius to figure out what they were whispering to one another about. A little bit of drama here and there was always welcomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, not everyone was taking this well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Acting all chummy in public, don’t you have a sense of shame?” Wu Qing clicked her tongue in annoyance as she clutched the hems of her clothes tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Dan also frowned at the remark too. “It looks like the two of them are closer than I thought. It might get a bit troublesome…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan felt an urge to cover her own face. She had never felt so embarrassed in her entire life.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What in the world is wrong is that fellow’s mind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wait a moment, did he just say ‘teacher’?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Kun also bore the same doubts in mind, so he gestured at his underlings. Unexpectedly, his underlings averted their gazes, not responding to him at all. Left with no choice, he could only step forward himself to challenge Zu An. “Take a look at your surroundings closely. You’re in the Sky class right now. This isn’t a place where someone from the Yellow class should be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looks like these people are really inept. They sure don’t know how to read the situation! I really should find myself new underlings soon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Did you just say that this isn’t a place where I should be?” Zu An looked at Shi Kun with a playful look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course. A person should know his place. There’s nothing wrong with you being in the Yellow class; you’re simply born with inferior talent. However, it would be a grave mistake if you try to forcefully overstep your boundaries in hopes of breaking into higher grounds.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Kun was determined to trample Zu An all the way into the ground before everyone else. He wanted to see if the Chu clan would still accept that wastrel even after he was being humiliated before so many people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look at what you’re doing. What’s with that earlier melody and your hairdo? All your desperate attempts to raise your standing look no more than a joke before prodigies like us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gestured to the people around him as he spoke, only to frown right after. He noticed that the atmosphere in the room had suddenly gotten weird, and everyone else was looking at him peculiarly. Even Yuan Wendong had a hesitant look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on here?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Kun suddenly felt a terrible premonition, as if something really bad was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan rose to her feet and looked at Shi Kun coldly, “Young master Shi, Zu An is my husband. Regardless of his level of competence, it’s not your place to criticize him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She might not be fond of Zu An, but she couldn’t bring herself to sit still while others were putting down her husband right before her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan’s act of standing up for Zu An only further stoked Shi Kun’s fury. However, he didn’t allow his emotions to show through, still maintaining the perfect smile on his face. “Young miss Chu, you have misunderstood my words. I don’t mean to criticize the Chu clan. I just think that someone as outstanding as you should have married an equally competent man. That fellow over there isn’t worthy of you at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Marry an equally competent man?” Chu Chuyan burst into laughter. “Such worldly standards bear no meaning to me. I think that Zu An is perfectly fine as he is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was outstanding enough as she was anyway; she didn’t need her husband to be capable too.

On top of that, Zu An was a teacher of the academy, which gave him even less reason to side with Shi Kun.</span></p>

She was very tempted to nod her head, but after getting done in earlier on this very issue, there was no way she would foolishly leap into his trap once more. Besides, Xie Xiu had already made a stance earlier. There was no way she would oppose her big brother Xie Xiu in public. So, she could only indignantly harrumph, “I dare not to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan’s eyes widened in bewilderment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on today?

With an authoritative voice, he ordered, “Go and stand outside the classroom.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Kun laughed at the sheer ludicrousness of the situation. “Who do you think you are?

In the worst-case scenario, they can even be expelled from the academy. Do you think that my words are just for show?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, he knew that there was only so much the rules could do. The academy couldn’t possibly expel the Sixth Young Master of the prominent Shi clan over such a minor issue. However, if it was a minor punishment, the academy wouldn’t say anything much about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, a teacher?” It was as if Shi Kun had heard the most hilarious joke in the world.

Besides, you didn’t introduce yourself when you entered earlier, so I don’t think that I should be blamed for this misunderstanding.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An nodded in agreement. “You’re right. I reckon that you would feel indignant if I punish you just like that too. Well, since that’s the case, why don’t we resolve this problem through arithmetic instead? I’ll conduct a test today, and anyone who can’t answer the question correctly will have to stand outside the classroom. Does that sound fair?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words immediately shocked almost every student present in the class.

He didn’t think that the questions Zu An came up with could possibly stump him. Besides, the bet involved not just him but everyone else in the class. He was confident that no one else in the class would be able to answer a question that even he couldn’t answer. Surely Zu An wouldn’t go to the extent of sending everyone out of the classroom, right? His wife was amongst the crowd after all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, listen carefully.” Zu An began posing his question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This question involves two people, A and B. A only speaks lies whereas B only speaks the truth, but the two of them can only answer questions through nodding or shaking their heads. One day, you’re faced with two diverging roads, Road One and Road Two. One of them leads to the capital whereas the other one leads to a small village. It just so happens that A and B are standing before you at this very moment, but you don’t know who is A and who is B, and you don’t know whether nodding means yes or no. Right now, you have to ask them a question and figure out which road leads to the capital. Given so, what’s the question that you’ll ask?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The students in the classroom gasped upon hearing the question.

Even after hearing the question in full, he was still having difficulties trying to comprehend what was going on. A long time later, he finally answered with a reddened face, “I don’t know. However, I don’t believe that any of the other students can answer the question either. I dare you to test her too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pointed his finger at Chu Chuyan.

At this very moment, Chu Chuyan’s mind was in a fluster. She was still having difficulties trying to snap out from her earlier shock, and the question Zu An posed earlier had stumped her as well.</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone! New month, new updates!</p>
 <p>The previous release schedule was quite uncomfortable for many of our readers in the states, so I bumped it up by 12 hours. Hopefully, those of the F5 sect will be able to make a breakthrough soon because of this change :D</p>
 <p>For those of you who are willing to support the novel, there will be more sponsored chapters available soon!</p>
 <p>Thank you all for supporting this novel. Happy reading!</p>
