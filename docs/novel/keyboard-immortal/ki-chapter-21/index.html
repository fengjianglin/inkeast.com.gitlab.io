 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“No, that’s not…” Ji Xiaoxi quickly averted her eyes. “I didn’t think that you’re that good-looking.” She was too embarrassed to look at him properly earlier in the water, so it was only now that she finally caught a good glimpse of his appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Indeed. Back in my hometown, my family and friends tend to call me Sanlitun’s Daniel Wu.” Zu An was more than delighted to be acknowledged by a beauty. When he heard Cheng Shouping mention that the First Miss of the Chu clan had brought him in as her wife was due to his looks, he thought that it was just bootlicking. However, now that he looked at it again, it seemed like his looks were indeed considered outstanding in this world. <a href="#footnote_1" id="footnote_ref_1">[1]</a></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Who is Daniel Wu?” Ji Xiaoxi asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Ah, he’s one of the best-looking men back in my hometown,” Zu An replied as he began to reminisce about his other world. He missed his handphone and internet, and the boredom of having nothing to do really grated at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Oh.” Ji Xiaoxi’s face reddened a little. All of a sudden, she said, “You aren’t a good person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Ah? Why is that so?” Zu An was astonished. While the young woman was a little naive, there was no doubt that she was stronger than him in terms of strength. If she were to turn against him right now, it would pose quite a bit of trouble to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“You said that the Assrip Wolves were chasing you, and it was in a moment of fluster that you fell into the water. However, when I took a look around the area, there are no traces of Assrip Wolves around. Furthermore, your clothes are folded neatly on the shore, which shows that you entered the water in a relaxed manner. The situation is definitely different from how you depicted it to be,” Ji Xiaoxi said as she pointed to the marks on the ground. She was naive, but she wasn’t a fool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An laughed in embarrassment. However, the time they spent chatting with one another earlier had given him a good grasp of her personality, so he quickly explained, “It’s not that I want to lie to you, but I was afraid that you would misunderstand, especially given the situation then. That’s why I spun up that excuse. However, it’s true that I lost consciousness and ended up being swept there. I assure you that I wasn’t lying about that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Is that so?” Ji Xiaoxi assessed him suspiciously from head to toe. “You seem to be in perfect condition though. You don’t appear to be ill to me. Give me your hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“What?” Zu An was a little perplexed, but the young woman had a disposition that made it hard for anyone to turn down her request. He subconsciously obeyed her and stretched his hand out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Three icy fingers fell on his pulse, and at that moment, Ji Xiaoxi seemed to have turned into a different person. Her gentle and tender atmosphere suddenly turned severe and inviolable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even a chatterbox like Zu An found himself not daring to say anything out of fear of interrupting her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I see. There’s indeed a problem with your Sea of Yin Pulse,” Ji Xiaoxi retracted her fingers as she said. Her wariness toward him alleviated slightly, and it was replaced with pity instead. “I’m afraid that I am unable to treat you due to my lacking skills. However, you need not worry. My father should be able to do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Seeing the young woman eyeing the lower half of his body with a look of sympathy, Zu An felt tears brimming in his eyes. Which man would be willing to show his weak side to a woman? He was still thinking of teasing her a little, but now that his problem was completely seen through by her… How embarrassing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An felt deeply regretful. He shouldn’t have given his arm to her so obediently. But again, how was he to know that this young woman was actually such a capable physician?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Wait a moment, her surname is Ji, and she’s skilled in medicine too. It can’t be that coincidental, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An tried asking, “May I ask who your father is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Ji Xiaoxi replied with a sweet smile, “My father is Ji Dengtu. He has quite some fame in Brightmoon City, so you might have heard of him.” She was initially guarded against him, but after learning of his illness, she put her wariness away. She believed that the earlier peeking incident was indeed an unintended coincidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Ah, Divine Physician Ji. I have heard of him,” Zu An replied. After some thought, he decided not to tell her that the reason behind his trip here was due to the task allocated by Divine Physician Ji.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“You need not worry too much about it. I’ll bring you home to meet my father. He should have a way to treat your illness.” Seeing the slightly out-of-it look on Zu An’s face, Ji Xiaoxi thought that he was worrying about his illness, so she quickly consoled him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“But I still need to collect goubaos.” Zu An was a little skeptical at Ji Xiaoxi’s offer to help. He had seen just how much Divine Physician Ji loved his money, and he had put down his daughter unhesitatingly in public too. It was hard to believe that a person like that would help him if he didn’t complete his task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hearing Zu An’s words, &nbsp;Ji Xiaoxi hesitated a little before saying, “But given your strength, I’m afraid that…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her meaning was extremely clear.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s not that I want to look down on you, but your strength is indeed trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An chuckled in response. “I was indeed feeling a little troubled by this matter, but I figured a way out after meeting you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“After meeting me?” Ji Xiaoxi appeared to be put in a spot too. “But I’m only at the third rank. If I use the dragon feces, those Assrip Wolves would only stay as far away as possible. As for the sedative, I’ve already used up all of them to deal with the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An felt that it was a miracle that this young woman could live till this day. She actually gave away all of her trump cards to a stranger without any hesitation. Had she never contemplated the possibility that he could possibly be a bad person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But thinking deeper into it, it could be because she knew the affliction he was suffering from that she was able to put down her guard against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Don’t worry, I don’t need your help. I can settle this by myself,” Zu An replied with a secretive smile. “You mentioned earlier that the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino is vindictive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Indeed,” Ji Xiaoxi replied with a nod. It was then that her eyes widened in realization. “You’re intending to use the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino to deal with those Assrip Wolves? Even though the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino has thick skin, its speed is far from a match for those Assrip Wolves. It’ll be hard for it to kill them. Besides, the leader of the Assrip Wolves appears to have already reached the third rank. In a real fight, I’m afraid that the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino wouldn’t be a match for them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I have an idea in mind.” Zu An replied with a mysterious smile as he began making his way downstream. The perplexed Ji Xiaoxi quickly followed him too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The two of them returned back to the shore and saw that the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was already starting to rouse from its sleep. As potent as Ji Xiaoxi’s sedative was, its amount wasn’t enough to knock out this massive beast for too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An quickly turned to Ji Xiaoxi and asked, “Do you have a handkerchief?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I do.” Ji Xiaoxi subconsciously took out a clean white handkerchief and passed it to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Smelling the light fragrance of an orchid coming from it, Zu An hesitated for a little before asking, “Do you have one that is used? It’ll be a pity to dirty this one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“It’s fine, I’ll just wash it afterward.” Ji Xiaoxi waved her hand casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An thought that she probably wouldn’t want to wash it by the end of it, but he chose to swallow those words back down. “Alright, I’ll owe you a handkerchief then. I’ll buy you a new one when we get back to the city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After saying those words, Zu An took out the Poisonous Prick and covered it tightly with the handkerchief, revealing just the tip of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Ji Xiaoxi was confused. “What are you going to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Stand a bit farther away,” Zu An said without explaining. After Ji Xiaoxi was finally hiding by the side, he walked up to the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino. While holding the Crazy Rhino’s tail with one hand, he used the other to push the entire dagger up into the rhino’s ass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“???”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You have successfully trolled Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino for +2 +2 +2 +2…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zu An was surprised. Perhaps it was because these wild beasts lacked intelligence, that’s why the Rage points they produced was much less as compared to humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was initially still a bit giddy, but the abrupt insertion of a foreign object into its rear jolted it awake right away. It rose to its feet and hurriedly turned to its back to take a look. However, its body was simply too inconveniently bulky that despite turning many rounds, it was unable to figure out what had happened to its rear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It was then that a whistle sounded not too far away. A human was waving its hands to it, and this infuriated the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino. It figured that this human must have been the shameless culprit who dared make a move against its rear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Its eyes grew redder and redder, and a breath of white smoke snorted out from its nose. It began charging forward like a frenzied bull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Seeing that he had successfully caught the rhinoceros’ aggro, he immediately turned tail and took flight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Meanwhile, Ji Xiaoxi watched the human-and-rhino chase by the side with a flabbergasted look on her face. “This is the idea he has in mind? It feels… disgusting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">However, she was still worried about Zu An’s safety, so she quickly chased after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fortunately, even though the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was at the fourth rank, its bulky body and powerful defense were offset by its lack in speed. Despite it chasing after Zu An with all of its might, it was unable to close the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The chase continued all the way till the borders of the Wolf Valley. The Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino suddenly halted its footsteps right before the entrance. It was aware that it was about to enter the territory of the Assrip Wolves, and its instincts compelled it to stop its footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Seeing this, Zu An turned around and shouted at it, “Hey, big oaf! How does it feel to have your ass busted? Don’t you want to get revenge? I guess yo' mama wasted her effort giving birth to a big lump of trash like you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino didn’t understand human speech, but it knew that the human was definitely insulting it. Recalling the insolent act of aggression the human had done to it earlier, its eyes began burning with rage as it charged forward once more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Who cares about the Assrip Wolves? My skin is tough enough anyway, so the bites of those lousy dogs can’t hope to do anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You have successfully trolled Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino for +2 +2 +2 +2…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">On the other hand, Zu An laughed arrogantly as he led it straight toward the den of the Assrip Wolves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Assrip Wolves had just finished their meal and were lying lazily on the ground. It was a huge pity that the human from earlier on was too skinny, such that it wasn’t enough to share amongst their hundred wolf brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Starvation was actually not the worst feeling in the world. The worst feeling was to be only given a bite while one was starving; that only worsened the feeling of deprivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">All of a sudden, the leader of the Assrip Wolves pricked up its ears. He could sense the ground tremoring. Could it be that some massive fellow had just entered their territory?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Awooooooo~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The leader of the Assrip Wolves immediately gathered its people in preparation to deal with the intruder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Hmm, another human has barged in here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The leader of the Assrip Wolves was a little perplexed. Were humans that fearless nowadays? That being said, it was not as if it would turn down food that was delivered right at its doorstep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So, it immediately ordered all of its subordinates to encircle the human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Seeing that the Assrip Wolves were starting to make a move, Zu An hurriedly did a u-turn and ran out of the Wolf Valley. On the other hand, the less agile Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino had a much harder time doing that. The sheer momentum built up by its massive body made it impossible for it to brake swiftly, so it ended up ramming all the way into the den of the Assrip Wolves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The sudden appearance of the massive rhino caught the Assrip Wolves off guard. They quickly hurriedly scattered around the area to avoid the impact, but there were a few of them who failed to dodge in time and ended up being violently rammed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This abrupt intrusion of the massive rhino infuriated the leader of the Assrip Wolves. If the enemy was a fifth rank beast, it would have swallowed its anger and tolerated it. However, the rhino was a mere fourth rank beast, not to mention that it was a dumb oaf who couldn’t even move its body properly! There was no way it would fear such an enemy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Awoooooo~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The leader immediately ordered its pack to let the human go and focus on the rhino. That human had barely any meat on him whereas this rhino was enough to feed them for at least ten days. It was obvious which prey it would choose to hunt down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So, the Assrip Wolves rushed toward the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino to bite down on its rear. Some of the more daring ones even leaped onto its back and clamped its fangs down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">However, the thick skin of the Red-Eyes Crazy Rhino was no joke either. Instead of hurting it, the wolves who tried to bite down on it nearly shattered its teeth instead. Despite having no sustained any injuries, the Crazy Rhino grew infuriated from the aggression of the Assrip Wolves. It turned around and rammed them down, crushing their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After the deed was done, it opened its mouth smugly, mocking the wolves for not knowing their place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Awooo~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That, in turn, provoked the leader of the Assrip Wolves. It raised its head toward the sky and howled out loud, sending a reminder to its subordinates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Are you all idiots? Have you forgotten what our specialty is? Wreck his ass!”</span></p>
