The stronger four of the five lackeys stepped forward to stop Zu An whereas the weakest hurried over to feed Shi Kun the medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had witnessed Zu An’s elusive movement skill and swift swordplay, so they dared not to let down their guard. They swung their weapons before them to create a defensive arc, aiming not to bring down Zu An but just to keep him at bay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An tried to charge forth numerous times, but he was forced to retreat before them. These four lackeys were stronger than him in terms of cultivation ranks, so it was hard for him to bypass them in a forceful charge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By then, the weakest subordinate had already reached Shi Kun and was offering him the pill. Shi Kun was dripping tears and snot around the place from the sheer pain. If someone told him that eating shit could alleviate his suffering, he would probably do so without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He swallowed the pill without any hesitation, and a moment later, his pain really began to alleviate. While it didn’t disappear entirely, it had receded to a level where he could still barely tolerate it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why would you have a pill like this?” Shi Kun’s face was drenched in sweat, such that his hair was sticking to his face. He looked at Qiao Xueying with appreciation in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiao Xueying glanced at Zu An with a slightly reddened face as she answered, “I suffered the same plight back then too, so I prepared some medicine in the off case the same thing happens once more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The previous encounter had really traumatized her, and being unaware of the cause of it only scared her more. So, she requested some Pain Suppression Heart Calming Pills from Divine Physician Ji in the off case that it happened to her once more. Who could have thought that it would really be put to good use here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An was dumbfounded. He didn’t think that this trump card of his was overcome so easily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why is my luck so bad today? Goddamnit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I wasted 100,000 silver taels on ‘Befriend a Rich Man’ for naught, and ‘Faith in Brother Spring’ wasn’t as useful as I thought. And now, I’ve wasted a precious use of ‘Knock-You-Up Eyes’ too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had used so many of his trump cards, but they still weren’t out of danger yet. This was really a huge loss to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Shi Kun had already recovered, Zu An dared not to push too much anymore. He quickly retreated to Chu Chuyan’s side, and the battle between Chu Chuyan and Qiao Xueying came to a halt too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well done!” said Shi Kun. His face was still pale and he couldn’t stop clutching his stomach, but he was in a much better condition now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Shit, congratulations on being the very first man in the Great Zhou Dynasty to have a taste of pregnancy and labor pain. Don’t you feel more appreciative of the sacrifices your mother had to make for you now? Don’t you think that you’ll be a far more filial son now?” said Zu An.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was done was done. He would just have to make it back by squeezing more Rage points out of Shi Kun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You were the one who did it earlier?” Shi Kun growled lividly. “Wait a moment, what do you mean by pregnancy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Shi Kun for +233 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t it obvious? The pain you suffered earlier was a symptom of labor pain. Actually, I’m quite curious as to where it would hurt for you. After all, you shouldn’t have a womb as a man, right?” asked Zu An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…” Shi Kun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It turns out that he really is the culprit here.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just thinking about the hellish experience he had just gone through made rage rush into his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Shi Kun for +1024 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiao Xueying was astonished too.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It really is pregnancy! Wait a minute, doesn’t this mean that I was knocked up by that hateful Zu An?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her face immediately flushed red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +1024 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll kill you!” Veins popped out on Shi Kun’s temples as he gathered his wind blades once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instead of stepping away, Zu An took a step forward and said, “Oh? You want to have a taste of pregnancy again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words immediately jotted up the intense spasms of pain that assaulted him earlier, and he began shuddering uncontrollably. The wind blades around him dispersed right away as he muttered with a hint of fear, “H-how did you do it?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An smiled. “Well, this skill is called ‘Knock-You-Up Eyes’. All it takes is one glance from me, and that person will be able to enjoy the joys of childbirth. Does any of you want to give it a try too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wherever Zu An’s gaze fell on, that person would instinctively take a step back. Be it Shi Kun or his lackeys, no one had any interest in suffering the pain of childbirth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Qiao Xueying was frightened too. She was probably the only one who could empathize with Shi Kun as she had been through the same unbearable pain too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rubbish! How could there be such… an eccentric skill in the world!” Shi Kun couldn’t stop his voice from quivering. Without a doubt, he was already scarred for life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t you already try it out yourself? Would you like to try it once more to see if I’m lying or not?” Zu An took another step forward.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there’s nothing else, we’ll be taking our leave then.” Zu An grabbed Chu Chuyan’s hand. “Honey, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan was still dazed even up to this point. Everything that had happened so far had transcended her common sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is it really possible for there to be a skill in the world that makes one pregnant just by looking at them? Doesn’t that mean that he can make me pregnant whenever he wants to?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those thoughts made Chu Chuyan’s face heat up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, she raised her hand and formed an ice barrier right behind the two of them. Innumerable wind blades crashed onto the ice barrier the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An quickly turned around, only to see that Shi Kun and his lackeys were chasing after them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, I nearly got scared off by you!” Shi Kun sneered in disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An’s faced darkened. “It looks like you really want another taste of pregnancy, huh? You better pray that you have enough medicine for everyone there then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words made Shi Kun’s lackeys recoil in fear. If all of them were to fall under the ‘Knock-You-Up Eyes’ skill, the ones prioritized for the medicine would definitely be Shi Kun and Qiao Xueying. As for the rest of them… it was likely that they would have to suffer through the full course of the skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Kun harrumphed coldly. “Don’t be intimidated by him! How could there be a skill in the world that could induce pregnancy? Even if there is, he definitely has to pay a heavy price for it. Otherwise, given his vindictive personality, how could he possibly let us off? He could have just ended all of us with a glance instead of talking so much!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An was stunned. He realized that he had underestimated Shi Kun all this while. He should have known that a person who could reach his position at that age was bound to be no fool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could use the ‘Knock-You-Up Eyes’ again, but there were too many people here, and they had painkillers on them too. It was likely that his skill would just go to waste once more. He would be much better reserving this skill to use on someone else in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan pulled Zu An behind her and glared at Shi Kun coldly, “We haven’t finished our earlier battle. Let’s continue then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your aura… Why do you seem unharmed?!” Shi Kun’s eyes widened in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earlier clash had proved that he wasn’t a match for Chu Chuyan in a direct confrontation, not to mention that his limbs were still weak from the extreme pain he just suffered from the ‘Knock-You-Up Eyes’. In his current condition, he wouldn’t stand a chance against her at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone quickly explained to Shi Kun how Zu An had fed her a bottle of medicine, which led to Shi Kun staring at Zu An deeply. “I must admit, I have made a grave error thinking that you were an insignificant good-for-nothing. With all of the means you have displayed here today, there’s more reason for me to eliminate you for good here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more outstanding Zu An was, the higher chances of him winning Chu Chuyan’s body and soul over. Besides, even if not for Chu Chuyan, it was a threat in itself to make an enemy out of a talented individual who possessed a myriad of means. The wisest move was to stifle Zu An while he was weak, or else he would surely pose a great threat in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you being too confident here?” remarked Chu Chuyan with a frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had recovered greatly from her injuries whereas Shi Kun was in a weakened state at the moment. Even if he combined forces with Qiao Xueying here, she was confident that she could deal with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the others, given the powerful movement skill that Zu An had demonstrated earlier, he should be able to hold his own against them until her battle came to an end. Overall, they should have been in an advantageous position here, so she couldn’t understand why Shi Kun was making such confident remarks here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed, it would be hard for me to defeat you in my current condition. Had it been any other situation, I would have offered a truce.” Shi Kun paused for a moment as he glanced at Zu An. “However, that fellow is a huge variable. I’ll have to get rid of him here regardless of the cost!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heed my summons, Devouring Kun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Kun raised his ring up high as he muttered an esoteric chant. His ring began to glow with a grayish light as a terrifying pressure crushed down from above.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of his lackeys immediately fell to their knees under the pressure, unable to move at all. A green barrier formed around Qiao Xueying, allowing her to barely hold on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An wasn’t faring any much better either. The sudden outburst of pressure made it hard for him to breathe, as if a mountain was crushing down on his back. His bones began to creak under the force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If even fourth rank cultivators were finding it hard to hold on, how well could a third rank cultivator possibly stand against it? It was just that he gritted his teeth and tried his best to hold on here. He didn’t mind mooching off others, but he wouldn’t allow himself to kneel before Shi Kun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that willpower could only do so much against absolute strength. Just as he was about to cave in, he felt a cooling touch wrapping around his hand, and the pressure on him suddenly alleviated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blue barrier was erected around them. Chu Chuyan had activated her Blue Guardian once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was daytime, but the sky suddenly darkened. Zu An raised his head, only to be appalled by what he was seeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A massive beast of over three hundred meters in length had floated into appearance in the air. It was grayish in color, reminiscent of a massive whale. However, its appearance was far more frightening than any whales. There was a blood-red light glaring from its eyes, and it had a massive mouth filled with innumerable sharp teeth. Its appearance looked more than enough to intimidate any lifeform into submission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the whiskers curling down from its mouth, Zu An frowned doubtfully.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why does this look like the kun</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span id="footnote-ref-eeb0"><a href="#footnote-eeb0">[1]</a></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;I’ve seen in game ads in my previous life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This aura… Ninth rank?!” Chu Chuyan’s face paled. “No, its aura is at ninth rank, but its strength is much weaker.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter how much weaker the summoned beast was, it was still far beyond her means to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gleeful smile emerged on Shi Kun’s face as he said, “This is the means our Shi clan possesses. It’s a defensive tool that my clan has specially prepared for me, and I was reserving it only for dire situations. Zu An, you should be glad that you’re going to die in the hands of Divine Beast Devouring Kun…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zu An interrupted him before he could finish his words, “Wait a moment, you said that this beast is called Devouring (Shi) Kun too? Ah, it actually has the same name as you! Is it your father?”</span></p>

 <p>For those of you who are willing to support the novel, there will be more sponsored chapters available soon!</p>
 <p>Thank you all for supporting this novel. Happy reading!</p>
