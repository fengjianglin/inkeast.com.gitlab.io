 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The River Patrol Army was originally set up as a preventative measure against the river flooding. If the river floods, then they need large amounts of manpower to repair the dike. There was also a need of laborers to cut out canals for ease of transportation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, as the transportation system developed, the River Patrol Army also assumed the role of ensuring the safety of the trade route along the river. They were in charge of exterminating some wild beasts in the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brightmoon City’s area prospered because of the salt industry, and because of the potential profits, the illicit drug trade had always been a problem. The River Patrol Army thus took on the job of suppressing smugglers. Over time, everyone eventually called them the River Patrol Police Camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside a secret room within River Patrol Camp’s government office, Commander Sang Qian bowed respectfully to an elder. “Father’s move truly is brilliant. You’ve effortlessly divided Wang and Chu clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Hong lightly stroked his beard. There wasn’t much joy in his expression. “How can it be that simple? I really would be looking down on Chu Zhongtian if this was enough to make those two families fall out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it possible that Chu Zhongtian can still turn things around?” Sang Qian asked with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He will definitely think up some countermeasures, but it doesn’t matter.” Sang Hong released a light laugh. “The exchange permit is just the beginning, there’s still a whole arsenal of tricks waiting for him. We’ll cut off their most competent ally first, and then we’ll deal with the isolated Chu clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You make Brightmoon Duke sound pretty impressive, but isn’t he still being toyed with under father’s hands?!” Sang Qian roared with laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Hong shook his head. “It’s not that Chu Zhongtian is inferior, but instead that I have the emperor and empress behind me. The irresistible trend isn’t something a mere man can go against.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Qian grumbled to himself that his father always loved to blabber about nonsense. He was clearly doing amazing for himself, yet he kept flattering other people. He really was taking modesty too far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, by the way, father needs to take good care of your body too. Brightmoon City’s rich merchants sent over some of Immortal Abode’s ‘fine goods’ earlier.” Sang Qian winked as he spoke, giving his father a knowing expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Hong rolled his eyes at his son. “Are you really still holding a grudge because I didn’t let you go to Immortal Abode last time? You called for their girls as soon as I turned my back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wouldn’t dare!” Sang Qian bowed his head at once in apology. But inside, he had some other thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father has always been upright and honest. I’ve made a rash decision in calling those escorts today! This might slander your respected self’s name and easily draw political attacks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As long as I can take care of the mission the imperial household has assigned me, an honest reputation is pointless. Your dad will give you a piece of wisdom today,” said Sang Hong with a heavy voice, “An honest appearance is completely useless apart from having a good reputation. If you want to be an honest and upright official, then you have to be even more crafty than those corrupt officials.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only if you receive those clans’ gifts would they treat you as one of their own, only then will cooperation become much easier in the future, eliminating some unnecessary misgivings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The task we were entrusted with this time is to deal with the Chu clan, take back all of their salt and iron wealth back to the court where it belongs. Everything else is secondary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Hong bowed respectfully. “Father’s instructions are wise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t help but sign inwardly. To even justify sleeping with women with such proper wording and reasoning… perhaps his father was the only one in this world who would do such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reporting! Chu clan’s young master Zu An has brought men with him and requested a meeting!” A soldier passed on this message at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did he come here?” Sang Qian’s brows furrowed. He really didn’t like this guy for some reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought about how that second-rate rascal ended up obtaining the goddess like first miss Chu, he really felt like this was a flower falling into shit. No, this was a flower falling into an entire hole of shit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt even more irritated when he recalled how Zu An won a few hundred thousand silvers from his own family’s casino.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are letting your emotions affect you too greatly! How many times have I already taught you? You just don’t learn!” Sang Hong said in dissatisfaction. His son was way too immature, not possessing a shred of his father’s composure. “Go and see what Zu An came for.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes…” Sang Qian replied resentfully. It’s all that Zu An’s fault that his dad scolded him again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An was waiting in the hall. He suddenly saw two chunks of Rage points come from Sang Qian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An was speechless. He was already so upset when the two of them didn’t even meet yet?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Does he know about what happened between me and his fiance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But apart from having a bit of an ambiguous relationship, groped a few times, nothing really happened either?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’m really being wronged here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he let his imagination run wild, Sang Qian finally came. “Young master Zu, what brings you to River Patrol Police Camp today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Calling this fella young master made him want to throw up. How could the two words young master possibly fit someone like him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But his father always told him not to let his anger get the best of him. If he directly called out this guy’s name, wouldn’t he feel even more enmity?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was incredibly conflicted inside. But how could he possibly know that Zu An already knew about his hostility through a different way?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We discovered that a large batch of illicit salt is being unloaded from the pier tonight. That is why we need Commander Sang Qian to lead your men and completely take out those illicit salt traffickers.” Zu An didn’t feel like wasting any time with this man either, instead getting straight to the point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Illicit salt?” Sang Qian was immediately frightened. “Where did Brother Zu obtain his intelligence? Why did our River Patrol Army not receive any news of this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gave a slight nod to his subordinate while talking. That subordinate nodded slightly as well before silently withdrawing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An and the others didn’t notice anything. After all, there were just too many River Patrol Army men here, and none of them were familiar with this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I do not believe the key issue right now is where the intelligence comes from, &nbsp;but rather that we need to catch those criminals as quickly as possible.” Zu An obviously didn’t want to bring up Qiu Honglei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He originally wanted to berate this guy and say that even a brothel has better information than the army actually in charge of this type of criminal activity. Weren’t they completely good for nothing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after some consideration, the Chu clan still had to depend on them in the future. He held back on these words for now and cook his ass later when things were already decided afterwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s really not that I don’t believe you, but this matter is too important! If we always fail and alarm the true illicit salt traffickers, then that’ll only make it even harder to catch them in the future,” Sang Hong said with a heavy voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My information is definitely reliable. The commander just needs to do your part and catch them,” said Zu An. This didn’t come purely from his trust in Qiu Honglei, he himself already scouted things out. There was definitely no mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, does Brother Zu dare lay down a military order?” Sang Qian also got up, his expression becoming serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An’s eyes narrowed. He shook his head and said, “I am not a military soldier, why would I bother with any military order?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he had great confidence, he didn’t want to assume risks for no reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpected things always happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This guy is definitely up to no good by making me give some military order, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An frowned. He thought for a bit, and then he felt like this operation might not go as smoothly as he thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Qian laughed and said, “There is no need for Brother Zu to feel alarmed, I am merely seeking confirmation. It is just that dispatching troops isn’t that simple of a matter. I need to report to the authorities for approval. If we make a huge fuss but end up with nothing, then everyone from the top brass to the low level soldiers will have complaints.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You need to request for approval from the higher ups?” Zu An was stunned. “Then why are you wasting time here? How long does it take for this process to be completed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An’s brows furrowed tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where was there any time to waste like this? These fellas are so inefficient! No wonder the illicit salt trade has gotten so out of hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Qian then came up with all types of subjects to stall for time. Zu An replied indifferently to all of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while longer of this, Zu An finally couldn’t take it anymore. He got up and said, “If the commander’s side won’t be able to help, then I’ll move my Chu estate’s own men to catch the criminals.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things always had a higher chance of going wrong the more time was wasted. Being held up here already left him with a vague ominous feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please do not be impatient Brother Zu, it’ll be completed soon.” Sang Qian changed the topic. “Furthermore, the arrest of the illicit salt trade is our River Patrol Army’s responsibility, so how can we make Brightmoon Duke go through the trouble? If the governor, City Lord, heard about this, then I will be severely punished for negligence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will wait another ten minutes. If there is still no progress, then I will head over to deal with it myself.” Zu An also knew that Chu Zhongtian most likely sent him here out of reservations towards the regulations, to prevent his political enemies from having more things to use against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he couldn’t wait here limitlessly. If someone really scared those illicit salt traffickers away, then everything would go down the drain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Minutes?” Sang Qian didn’t really understand this measurement of time, but he roughly guessed Zu An’s intentions. “We’ll receive news soon. Please be patient, Brother Zu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After waiting a few more torturous minutes, Zu An finally couldn’t take it anymore. He got up and began to walk out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unknown if it really was a coincidence or not, a soldier suddenly ran in and said, “We received orders from above!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Qian said with a laugh, “Good, we’ll immediately mobilize the troops. Depart!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldiers in River Patrol Army’s drill ground began to gather. When he saw how slow these soldiers were moving, their armor not even on straight, Zu An frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Are these soldiers or riffraffs?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this type of army in charge, no wonder the illicit salt trade has grown so rampant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Qian’s expression also became a bit unpleasant, hurriedly explaining, “Yesterday’s drills ran a bit late. I reckon that the men haven’t completely recovered yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He spoke while roaring at his subordinates, “Hurry up, stop dilly dallying!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, no matter how he roared, those soldiers only put on a bit of an act. In reality, they didn’t move that fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just the assembling of the troops took half an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But thank the heavens they still departed in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Hong silently watched as the troops departed. He fiddled with a smoking pipe in his hand and quietly took a hit. His slim face flickered behind the rising smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of confusion rose within him. “How did Zu An manage to pinpoint the illicit salt traffickers’ activity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An brought Chu estate’s guards and River Patrol Army’s soldiers towards the pier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of worry that the illicit salt traffickers already ran, Zu An was extremely anxious. He urged the horse to charge crazily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, after only covering half the distance, a palanquin suddenly rushed out from a street.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zu An hurriedly reined his horse in. Even though it stopped at the final moment, those porters were clearly alarmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palanquin on the shoulders of the men who fell over also leaned to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aiya~” A young lady’s alarmed voice sounded from within.</span></p>
