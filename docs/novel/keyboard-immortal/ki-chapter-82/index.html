 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei took great pride in his occupation as a teacher, and he was extremely uncomfortable with this sort of streetlike atmosphere that was suffusing the classroom. However, thinking that he should prioritize dealing with Zu An here, he decided to bear with it. “Since that’s the case, we shall have the students here bear witness to the process lest someone refuses to acknowledge the bet later on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zu An raised his hand and said, “Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? Are you afraid now?” Yang Wei asked with a frown. He was worried that Zu An would back down at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Afraid?” Zu An burst into laughter. “Nay, I just want to find a witness for our bet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei gestured to the students around him and asked, “Are these people not enough for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course not!” Zu An replied matter-of-factly. “If you win, these witnesses would be enough for you. However, if I win, I’m afraid that we won’t have enough say to make you fulfill the end of your promise. After all, we’re in a weaker position here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that I’d lose to you?” Yang Wei snorted angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might not have excelled as a cultivator, but he was still proud of his expertise when it came to arithmetic. He wouldn’t allow anyone to question his ability in that field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s nothing for certain in this world. If you aren’t willing to do it, let’s just call off the bet.” Zu An shrugged before turning around to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei thought that Zu An was really going to back down at the last moment, and he immediately panicked. It wasn’t easy for him to lead his prey up to this point, and he was already on the verge of ensnaring him. There was no way he could allow Zu An to leave at this juncture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, he replied, “Very well then. Let’s get another teacher to bear witness to this. However, I don’t know who would be free at this timing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei was intending to bring some of the colleagues he was on closer terms with, but at that very moment, a refreshingly gentle voice sounded by the doorway. “I shall be the witness of this bet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The euphonic voice immediately caught the crowd’s attention, and everyone swiftly turned their heads over to look at the doorway. In an instant, the previously bustling classroom fell silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A woman was leaning lazily by the doorway. Her skin was fair and her lips were crimson. Her dress flowed along her body like silk, vaguely shaping out her beautiful profile. Even though she only revealed a small portion of her fair hands and legs through her dress, her appearance was more than enough to steal the breaths away from the men present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a carefree disposition that added an indescribable grace to her actions. Even just by casually leaning by the doorway, she still looked as beautiful as a goddess descending from the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Had it not been for the green wine gourd she was carrying on her waist, it was easy to think of her as an ethereal fairy untouched by the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“T… Teacher Shang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief moment of silence in the classroom, loud cheering broke out all around. The students all rushed forward to look at the woman with excited looks on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Yang Wei’s breathing hastened as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, he wasn’t willing to teach at the academy at the start. Just his work at the Civil Affairs Department was enough for him to keep his hands busy. Had it not been for the rules of the royal court dictating him to serve as a teacher, he would have never bothered coming to an academy to teach a bunch of immature brats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the first time he held a lesson at the academy, he caught sight of this woman’s visage, and all of a sudden, he felt that this work wasn’t so tough anymore. In fact, he would find reasons to stay at the academy, all in hopes that he would be able to catch an additional glimpse of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Zu An was also surprised by this development too. To his astonishment, he had actually met this woman before. They spent time playing with a flute in the gazebo back then…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah pui pui pui, I mean we bonded through music!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He asked the woman for her name afterward, but the latter refused to tell him, saying that they would meet each other again if fate permits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, he thought that she was just turning him down. How easy could it be for two strangers to meet one another once more in this massive world? However, now that he was looking at it once more, he felt that it was likely that the other party already knew that he was a student from Brightmoon Academy, and that they would surely meet one another again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not as if Zu An was a dense protagonist in a novel. With everyone around him addressing her as ‘Teacher Shang’, as well as those men acting as if they were animals in their mating season, he could figure as much that the woman was likely to be Shang Liuu, rank three on the Sweetheart Ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That would explain why the gorgeous principal had asked him if he was acquainted with Shang Liuyu, saying that the latter had helped him change the records. All of it was coming together now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei’s face immediately lit up as he put on what he thought to be his nicest smile as he said, “Teacher Shang, what brought you here today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Liuyu smiled back and said, “I just happened to be passing by. I heard some commotion, so I came in to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her smile was so potent that Yang Wei felt as if he could melt in it. However, when he recalled the situation he was in, his face immediately heated up. He quickly explained, “Sorry that you have to bump into something like this. This student simply too obstinate, so I’m hoping to teach him how to respect his elders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Liuyu shot a glance at Zu An, and her lips inched upward. “I happened to overhear that the two of you are intending to make a bet against one another. Why don’t I be the witness for your bet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sounds good~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher Shang, you’re the best~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher Shang, you’re my idol!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Loud cheers broke out in the classroom. From this, it could be seen just how popular Shang Liuyu was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” Yang Wei was a little hesitant to accept Shang Liuyu’s offer. It should have been easy enough for a teacher like him to deal with an unruly student, but if another teacher were to get involved too, there could be unexpected complications.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I unwelcomed here?” Shang Liuyu looked at Yang Wei quietly with her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Yang Wei was interacting with her in such proximity. Her impeccable face was like a critical strike right into his chest, leaving his breathing hastened. “T-that’s not what I mean! You’re more than welcome here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei quickly convinced himself that it was no big deal.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I don’t have any chance to interact with Shang Liuyu usually, so this is a good chance to display my talent before her. I might be lacking in terms of cultivation, but there’s no one in Brightmoon City who can hold a candle to me when it comes to arithmetic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was usually hardly any opportunity to flaunt his arithmetic skills. After all, he couldn’t possibly just walk up to Shang Liuyu and start reciting all sorts of mathematic equations—she would just think that he was insane! It was unlikely that he would ever get another opportunity to like this flaunt his skills before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher Shang, this way please.” Yang Wei guided her toward the podium fawningly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An clicked his tongue at his subservience, thinking that he was exemplifying the very definition of simping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Liuyu casually took a seat before smiling at the students. “Alright, let’s quieten down so as to not interrupt their match.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words seemed to contain some sort of sorcery. The classroom that had been as noisy as a wet market a moment ago suddenly fell utterly silent. Zu An couldn’t help but be impressed by her impressive charisma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei rolled up his sleeves as he felt motivation pumping through his veins. He was determined to prove his worth to his goddess. So, he used the knowledge he had accrued over the past few decades to craft out twenty highly difficult questions. He was confident that these students wouldn’t be able to solve them—even he would stumble on them if he got distracted for a moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could already imagine what was going to happen afterward. Zu An would nibble on his brush in frustration as he found himself utterly stupefied before the questions. Afterward, he would shamelessly claim that these questions were unsolvable. Then, before the respectful eyes of the students, he would slowly decipher every single question and awe everyone present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maybe Shang Liuyu will look at me with glittering eyes too. This might just be the start of my love life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just thinking about it was more than enough to make his cheeks quiver from laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No no no, I have to calm down. A lot of eyes are on me right now. I need to pay heed to my image!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, Yang Wei coughed softly before passing the test paper to Zu An. “It is not too late to back out now. If you can’t even do a single question, you’ll have to leave the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was only saying those words before Shang Liuyu to create the impression that he had no intention of cornering his student; it was his student who insisted on it himself. Of course, he was only saying those words because he knew that Zu An wouldn’t be able to retreat easily even if he wanted to given the current heated atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response, Zu An chuckled softly and said, “You’ll be the one leaving the academy if I get everything right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Putting aside Yang Wei, even the other students in the classroom felt that Zu An had a screw loose. Only Shang Liuyu was watching the scene with an enigmatic smile on her lips, as if she knew something that the others didn’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ignorant and arrogant!” Yang Wei flew into a state of wrath. “You shall pay the price of being so self-assuming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Yang Wei for +541 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t take being insulted by his student before his goddess too well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Zu An shrugged leisurely as he took the test paper over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that all you got?” Zu An burst into laughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be honest, he wasn’t certain that he would be able to answer all of the questions. After all, he wasn’t too sure how developed mathematics in this world was. However, when he saw the questions on the paper, he realized that he had been overestimating Yang Wei’s ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I advise you to focus your efforts on answering the question instead of running your mouth here. If you can’t finish the paper before class comes to an end… Heh…” Yang Wei didn’t finish his sentence, but his implied meaning was clear enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Liuyu couldn’t help but interject in, “There isn’t much time before the class comes to an end. Isn’t this too rushed? Why don’t we do this instead? Since I’m taking the next class, I’ll allocate half of the lesson to you so that you can take things slowly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei was taken aback by the proposal. However, he didn’t think that Shang Liuyu was really helping Zu An here. In the first place, Shang Liuyu wasn’t related to Zu An in any way, so there was no reason for her to look out for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My goddess is probably just pitying Zu An and want to give him a chance. She must also be worried that others would accuse me of bullying the juniors, so she’s doing this with my reputation in mind. How touching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wei was so moved that tears were about to seep out of his mouth. He quickly nodded his head and agreed to it, “Yes, what Teacher Shang makes perfect sense. Zu An, I’ll give you another half a class to answer the questions then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arithmetic is a subject where either you get it or you don’t. If you don’t understand anything at all, I can give you all the time there is in the world, and it’s still to no avail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Zu An couldn’t be bothered to respond to Yang Wei anymore, so he started reading the first question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">3 people drink 3 buckets of water in 3 days. How many buckets of water do 9 people drink in 9 days?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Suo’s eyes lit up right away upon seeing the first question. “This is such an easy question! Even I can answer that! If 3 people drink 3 buckets of water in 3 days, it should go without saying that 9 people would drink 9 buckets of water in 9 days!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words were met with widespread agreement by the students all around. Only a small minority felt that there was something wrong with the answer Wei Suo proposed, but they couldn’t put their finger on what was wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Yang Wei sneered coldly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Do you think that I would come up with such an easy question?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That being said, he didn’t bother putting a halt to the discussions all around. He would love more than anything for these people to mislead Zu An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Zu An shook his head in disappointment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even elementary schoolers would be able to solve such a question easily. 3 people drink 3 buckets of water in 3 days, which meant that 3 of them drank a bucket of water each day. Multiplying it proportionately, 9 people should drink 3 buckets of water each day, and 27 buckets of water in 9 days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zu An wrote down the answer, Yang Wei’s eyes widened in disbelief.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this be possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first time he saw this question on an ancient record, he ended up falling for its trick and answered it wrongly. Afterward, he posed this question to many of his colleagues, and most of them would instinctively answer ‘nine buckets of water’. How did this fellow solve it so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But again, this question wasn’t too difficult. Yang Wei thought that Zu An might have just gotten lucky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmph, this is the easiest question of the lot! The difficulty will only rise with each passing question. I don’t believe that you can remain so lucky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that given that Zu An had managed to answer a question, it would probably be difficult to chase him out of the academy as he had envisioned anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eyy, if only I knew that this would happen, I shouldn’t have set the bet so low.</span></p>

So, how many guests has she hosted in her house?’</span></p>
