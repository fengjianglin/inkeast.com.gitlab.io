 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with the son of the city lord and First Miss Chu eyeing him here, no matter what he chose, he would surely offend one side. This was truly a headache to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was then that the sound of galloping horses sounded outside. A glint immediately flashed across Sang Qian and Mei Chaofeng’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the entire Brightmoon City, there was no one else who had an army of cavalry other than the Chu clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, a tall silhouette that looked almost like a metal tower marched into the casino with a group of soldiers. All of these soldiers were donned in golden armor and red cloaks. There was a sharpness in their eyes that kept others away. As soon as they entered the casino, they immediately stood in two rows, surrounding everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their sharp and organized footsteps cast a grim and heavy atmosphere in the casino.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Chu clan’s Red Cloak Army. They do look much more formidable than those from the River Patrol Team.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shhh, quiet down! You don’t want your life anymore?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…&nbsp;</span></p>

He stepped forward and bellowed, “Yue Shan, what are you doing right now? How dare the Chu clan mobilize its private army without any legitimate justification? Are you planning a rebellion here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it hadn’t been long since Sang Qian was appointed, he was still able to recognize the leader of the Chu clan’s Red Cloak Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We only heard that our First Miss has been bullied, so we came here to protect her. Surely our Chu clan is justified in ensuring the safety of its own clan members?” Yue Shan replied coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying those words, he walked up to Chu Chuyan and bowed respectfully to her. “Paying respects to the First Miss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This turn of events had further hyped up Zu An.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How cool would it be if he calls me young master under such a situation?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, he waited in anticipation for Yue Shan to greet him too, only to see the latter looking at him hesitantly before turning his head away without saying anything. Indeed, Yue Shan was disregarding his presence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan smiled in response as she reached out to help Yue Shan up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the exchange of formalities, Yue Shan quickly got straight to the point. “First Miss, the Master has said that no matter how weakened our Chu clan is, we won’t allow a mere underworld organization to climb over our heads. As long as you give the word, we’ll obliterate the Plum Blossom Sect today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words immediately provoked a huge reaction from the crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Mei Chaofeng shuddered in shock at those words. The Plum Blossom Sect had been able to fare well in recent years not because they were powerful, but that the powers in Brightmoon City had implicitly recognized their existence and turned a blind eye to their activities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if they were to fall out with one another, the head of an underworld organization like him, even if he had backing from some higher-ups, couldn’t possibly be a match for a ducal clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Putting aside the fact that the Brightmoon Duke was an eighth rank cultivator, just the Chu clan’s Red Cloak Army was more than enough to obliterate the entire Plum Blossom Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no choice but to turn to Sang Qian for help.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sang Qian was also taken aback by how decisive the Chu clan was regarding this matter, such that he was unable to decide on a stance right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing how these two fellows were reacting, Zu An felt exhilarated inside. He had indeed made the right choice choosing to cling onto the thighs of the Chu clan. It sure felt good to oppress others with his connections!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He even forgot about his earlier thoughts to leap out of this ‘sinking ship’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, it was Pang Chun who coughed slightly and remarked probingly, “It doesn’t seem appropriate for the Chu clan to get involved with the administrative affairs here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words jolted Sang Qian out of his daze, and he hurriedly added, “Indeed! Is the Chu clan intending on plotting a rebellion here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan stepped forward and sneered coldly, “Is clearing off an underworld organization considered a rebellion? I must ask you to watch your words, or else I have no choice but to think that you’re intentionally defaming the Chu clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the First Miss of the Chu clan making her words known, the soldiers of the Chu clan placed their hands on the handles of their swords, ready to draw their blades and clear the field right away as soon as the command was issued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sang Qian gulped fearfully. “Whether the Plum Blossom Sect is an underworld organization or not, and how it should be punished should be a matter for the city lord to decide on. It’s against the rules for the Chu clan to overstep its jurisdiction.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very well, let’s follow the rules then.” Chu Chuyan’s eyes turned utterly cold. “Someone has plotted to electrocute my h… husband in the suburbs of the city, and there was an attempt to assassinate him outside the city right afterward. And not too long ago, someone tried to make use of his debt to sever his limbs… All of these matters are related to the Plum Blossom Sect. May I ask Lord Pang to arrest Mei Chaofeng and his 13 godsons, as well as all of the higher-ups of the Plum Blossom Sect. They must be thoroughly interrogated for their involvement in this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, that…” Pang Chun was put in a spot. He quickly turned his eyes toward Xie Xiu for assistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xie Xiu was also unsure of how he should maneuver the situation either. He had heard rumors that Zu An wasn’t too welcomed in the Chu clan, but the current situation appeared to disprove the rumors. In fact, Chu Chuyan appeared to be ready to go all out for Zu An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This realization left him feeling deeply envious. While he was still somewhat on friendly terms with Zu An, he was still a man after all. There was no man who could remain unfazed upon seeing a woman as beautiful as Chu Chuyan standing up for another man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Xie Xiu quickly adjusted his state of mind. In the first place, his target wasn’t a perfect woman like First Miss Chu. After all, no matter how perfect a woman was, the happiness she could bring to one could never be a match for a harem of women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the very least, that was his life’s philosophy. He would never get involved with those extraordinary women as they would only hinder him from philandering around. He liked how things currently were—flirting around with those lesser-known beautiful women and doing as he liked without having to think too much into matters; this was what life should be like!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Pang Chun was still waiting for Xie Xiu to give a directive to him, only to see bizarre expressions appearing on the latter’s face. This left him at a loss as to what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was then that Chu Chuyan spoke up once more, “If Lord Pang is worried about offending others, why don’t I have my men personally capture them and deliver them to the magistrate court?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Chu, please calm down.” Pang Chun took out a handkerchief to wipe off his sweat. “There’s a need for us to talk things over first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Sang Hong’s eyes also turned grim as well. The crime of attempted assassination on a member of a ducal clan was a huge matter. Seeing the killing intent emanated by First Miss Chu and the members of the Red Cloak Army surrounding them, he dared not to speak up for the Plum Blossom Sect recklessly anymore. He feared that it would bring his father trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mei Chaofeng’s heart was also pounding frenziedly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Am I going to meet my end here?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With such thoughts in mind, a vicious glint flashed across his eyes as he made up his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the very least, I’ll bring some of them down with me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was then that a voice sounded in his ears. “Write down a debt note of 7,500,000 silver taels and put an end to the matter here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mei Chaofeng could tell that it was Snow secretly transmitting her voice to him. It was then that he realized that the reason why the Chu clan was going hard on him was due to the debt of 7,500,000 silver taels. However, was it really safe for him to write such a debt note?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing Mei Chaofeng’s hesitation, Snow hurriedly said once more, “Are you a fool? Even if you write a debt note, you can still think of ways to delay the payment or even avert it all together later on! If the Chu clan were to really eradicate your Plum Blossom Sect today, the young master’s years of effort would go down the drain!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tight frown formed on Mei Chaofeng’s forehead as he replied, “However, the Chu clan doesn’t have the authority to pass judgment on us. If they dare to make a move here, the governor would surely clamp down hard on them afterward.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not that easy. The city lord of Brightmoon City is someone from King Qi’s faction. Besides, once you're locked in prison by then, there would surely be plenty of people who will step forward to testify against you. You should know deep well how many evil deeds the Plum Blossom Sect has committed over the years. Once they really start looking into it, you’ll be over!” Seeing how Mei Chaofeng still didn’t understand the gravity of the situation, Snow emphasized in a mixture of anxiety and fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mei Chaofeng was conflicted, but he had no choice but to make a decision here. So, he turned to Chu Chuyan and apologized. “Our Plum Blossom Sect has acted inappropriately here today and offended Miss Chu. Allow me to apologize to you here. I hope that you’ll be magnanimous as to forgive us for our mistakes today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having to say such subservient words before such a huge crowd left him with a burning heat on his cheeks. He could imagine how he would become the laughingstock of the crowd after tonight. The reputation that he had built up painstakingly over many years would be going to ruin just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had no other choice here. He dared not to gamble on the Chu clan’s determination to pull him down. If the Chu clan were to really order its army to apprehend everyone of the Plum Blossom Sect, it would indubitably be the end of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was just an individual, he might have still considered screwing everything so as to uphold his dignity. However, the Plum Blossom Sect didn’t just belong to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was someone behind him, and that someone had devoted great effort and resources into supporting him over the years. If the Plum Blossom Sect were to be destroyed within the span of a single night, even if he managed to get out of here with his life, there was no doubt that his backing would ensure that he was met with a cruel death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, he could only put down his pride and apologize to the lady who was much younger than him. At this very moment, every single stare coming from the crowd felt like a huge shame to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mei Chaofeng apology didn’t appear to have fazed Chu Chuyan at all. He knew very well that it was impossible to settle the matter here with just a couple of words, so he shouted, “Men, bring me paper and brush!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, his subordinates brought paper and brush over. He quickly wrote out a debt note and handed it over to Chu Chuyan. “Miss Chu, here is a debt note of 7,500,000 silver taels. We’re willing to admit our loss and pay what is owed to you. However, we can’t afford to fork out such a huge sum of money in a moment’s time—there’s probably no power in the world who has the ability to pull that off. So, I need to ask Miss Chu to give us some leeway. We’ll make sure to pay an interest every year. As for the main sum, we’ll find a way to raise the money. May I know what’s your thought about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mei Chaofeng had played a little trick here. It was stated on the debt note that the money was owed to Zu An and not the Chu clan. He wouldn’t be in a good position to shirk off a debt against the Chu clan, but if it was just Zu An, there was still space to maneuver around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chuyan noticed this detail too, but in consideration that the money was won by Zu An, she didn’t think that it was appropriate for her to claim his earning as a property of the Chu clan. So, she turned to Zu An and asked, “What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An was pleased to see that Chu Chuyan was seeking his opinion. He took a look at the note before remarking pretentiously, “Aiyo. If only Sect Master Mei did this earlier, this matter could be resolved easily. Yet, you just had to try your luck. Looks like you’re the kind of person who needs a spanking before you’ll learn!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +888 Rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mei Chaofeng nearly spurted blood on the spot.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the Chu clan, I would never allow a wastrel like you to talk shit to me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He nearly gave in to his rage to pummel Zu An into dust on the spot, but looking at Chu Chuyan and the Red Cloak Army that Yue Shan had brought here, he could only swallow his grievances down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zu An took a look at the debt note and said, “Hm? You’re only going to pay the interests? Well, I shall have magnanimity and go easy on you. I shall charge only 10% per annum. I trust that it’s acceptable to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it is,” Mei Chaofeng replied with gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be fair, a rate of 10% per annum was not expensive at all. Compared to the high-interest loan charged by the Plum Blossom Sect, an interest rate of 10% was almost like free money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, why did it feel particularly jarring hearing these words coming out of Zu An’s mouth? Not to mention, that merciful look he had on his face that made it seem as if he was showing pity to a beggar…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have successfully trolled Mei Chaofeng for +345 Rage!</span></p>

Are you going to pay with silver ingots or banknotes?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…” Mei Chaofeng.</span></p>
