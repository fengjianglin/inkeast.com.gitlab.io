 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Fwoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Two blurry figures instantly appeared in front of Count Sagunda as he attempted to get between the emperor and Ruv Tylen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Thwack!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Gwagh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a dull sound, Count Sagunda dropped a fist-sized dagger from his palms and fell to his knees. The identity of one of the blurs was Count Jean Granite, and he kicked the dagger away after knocking down Count Sagunda.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, he looked up towards the other blur with a surprised expression. The other man had instantly appeared behind Count Sagunda and struck him on the back of the neck. It was Elkin Isla, the knight of the Pendragon Duchy who had maintained an impassive expression during the entire time after entering the Lion Hall. Even now, he maintained his cold gaze as he subdued Sagunda.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sheathe your sword, Sir Granite.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Granite retrieved his sheathe which he had used to strike Sagunda’s wrists.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Cough! Cough!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor looked down at Count Sagunda as the man drooled in an ugly manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you understand the significance of your actions just now, Lord Sagunda?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keugh….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda raised his head. His face was covered with tears in pain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Majesty, this is… This man is… No, I, I…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda spoke gibberish with a soulless expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor silently gazed at the count.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to understand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sagunda was not an incompetent fool.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As much as he was greedy, he was smart and he always maintained his composure in any circumstance. He was a man who would do anything to maintain his own safety and preserve his power. So why would he resort to such a brainless action in front of so many nobles, especially in front of his royal self?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A glimmer finally appeared in the emperor’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It seemed as if he finally understood why Count Sagunda made such a decision just now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did Lord Sagunda instigate you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ruv Tylen was observing the whole situation unfold with a dazed look, then became startled and hurriedly nodded his head up and down at the emperor’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Y, y, yes, Your Majesty! The seal on the letter I received from the mercenaries, without a doubt, it belonged to Count Sagunda!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah….!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once again, the entire hall drew in a sharp breath of shock at Ruv Tylen’s words. The man who was responsible for the attempted assassination was found to be none other than the governor of Leus, the second largest port city in the entire empire. A man who could be considered one of the top ten nobles in the political circle had committed the high crime of attempting to assassinate the crown prince.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now it was obvious that all of his relatives and kin, as well as anyone who had any connection to Count Sagunda, would not be able to avoid the fiery storm that was sure to descend.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if to prove the point, the faces of the nobles who had been frequently in contact with Count Sagunda slowly turned pale.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An eerily silent confusion descended on the Lion Hall.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After sinking into a brief moment of thought, the emperor lifted his head and turned his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Duke Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two men shared a short look. Even though it was only for a moment, it was clear that the two came to the same conclusion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..Uagh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A sudden groan broke the silence and caught everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven and the emperor displayed shock.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda had his fist to his neck with his eyes flipped open, revealing only the whites.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sagunda’s face quickly turned blue and his body shook ceaselessly. Count Jean Granite hurried to his side and supported him. Soon, Count Sagunda’s fist fell from his neck, and his hand went limp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dark red droplets began to paint the surroundings of his neck. After observing Sagunda’s neck, Count Granite looked up with a darkened expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…His ring contained a poisoned needle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda’s face continued to darken until it became black, and his mouth foamed with dark, red, bubbles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keugh! Keu….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a few final convulsions, the movements finally ceased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The truth of a treasonous act was revealed at the grand banquet of the imperial castle. Furthermore, the criminal had even committed suicide in front of the emperor, and the nobles could only stare in shock with ghastly expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Several royal guards hurriedly recovered his body, and Count Granite spoke in a somber voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My apologies, Your Majesty. I never thought he would be carrying such a device in his ring…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it’s not your fault.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The duty of Count Jean Granite, the captain of the Royal Knights, was to escort the emperor and to ensure his safety. If Count Sagunda had attempted to attack the emperor, he would have been instantly crushed before by Count Granite before he could make a move.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, after his attempt to kill Tylen failed, Count Sagunda had proceeded to touch the back of his neck as if to stroke the place where Isla had attacked him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No one could have anticipated that he was actually committing suicide with a ring-mounted sting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor raised his stiff face. The nobles of the Aragon Empire did not dare meet his eyes and hurriedly bowed their heads.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The banquet is over. Everyone may return.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As your will, Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As your will!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles bowed their heads and shouted in one voice. After turning around, the emperor started to walk back towards where he had come from, then suddenly stopped next to someone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think we need to have a talk. Come to my office along with Ian.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven responded with a somber expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After patting Raven on the shoulders, the emperor was escorted away by the royal guards along with the empress.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“T, that will wrap up the grand banquet today! The pillars of our great empire are to each…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even before the announcement was over, the nobles hurried out of the Lion Hall in small and large groups. Everyone turned away from the body of Count Sagunda and did their best to avoid glancing in its direction. However, a considerable number of people stole glances at someone else as they left -- a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;young duke who looked down at the body of Count Sagunda with quiet eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The tide is…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Now leaning towards that man.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone could now recognize that the small wind that blew from the periphery had gained momentum and finally evolved into a huge typhoon that was capable of shaking the entire Aragon Empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After sending everyone from the Pendragon family back to the Golden Rose Palace, Raven stood in front of the royal office. The chief of staff, who had personally guided him, knocked on the doors that were guarded by two soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Majesty, Duke Pendragon has arrived.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two Royal Knights opened the doors at the voice of the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes narrowed as he walked into the royal office.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though it had an elegant air, the office of the emperor was rather neat and simple, somewhat unexpected from the great master of the entire empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Raven’s surprise wasn’t due to the appearance of the office. Rather, it was due to the group of people that were gathered inside the office.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Apart from the emperor, there were three more people present in the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The group was composed of Count Jean Granite, the head of the Royal Knights, Prince Ian, and Duke Lindegor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Emperor Aragon was seated at the head of the long maple table which could seat dozens of people and Count Granite stood behind the emperor, while Duke Lindegor and Ian were seated to the left and right of the table.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sit down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven sat where the emperor gestured towards. Coincidentally, it was the seat opposite of Duke Lindegor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll get straight to the point. I think all of you are already aware of why I gathered everyone here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven, Ian, and Duke Lindegor nodded their head wordlessly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I will ask again, just in case. Lasse, why do you think Sagunda acted in such a thoughtless way today?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only the emperor could address Duke Lindegor in such a casual manner. Duke Lindegor answered in a calm voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is highly likely that he lost his composure when he attempted to kill the man named Tylen. He must have been overcome by his nervousness. As soon as his name came out of Tylen’s mouth, it would have signaled the end for himself and his family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think so too. Ian and Alan, what do you two think?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I agree as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian nodded his head in response, and Raven replied as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even so, his actions were too reckless. Sir Granite was present in the hall, as well as the captain of the griffon order. Even a fool would know that his actions were most futile. Furthermore, the Sagunda I know of was anything but a fool.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm, your words have their merits. What are your thoughts, then?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It felt as if the emperor was treating Raven as his own child or a nephew. However, Raven was not at all offended by the emperor’s attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Given that he took such an attitude in private, rather than in public, it was certain that the emperor considered himself and Duke Lindegor a part of his own family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sagunda wouldn't have wanted any other names to come out of Ruv Tylen’s mouth. Perhaps the name of Sagunda’s conspirator, or the person who stands behind him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm… Are you saying that Sagunda acted in such a way to take all the blame onto himself?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor nodded his head while stroking his chin, and Duke Lindegor gazed at Raven with an expression of surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, in the end, all of the nobles gathered today in Lion’s Hall witnessed Sagunda’s behavior. Everyone is bound to think that he acted in such a manner to prevent Ruv Tylen from speaking his own name.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Therefore, they will be prone to believe that he was the mastermind behind the assassination of Crown Prince Shio. But as you may already know, Your Majesty, Sagunda definitely did not act alone. He certainly has conspirators or instigators. And Sagunda… he must have been very afraid of them. That’s why he committed suicide.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your thoughts align with mine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor nodded his head with a solemn expression before continuing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is as Alan said. Sagunda was not a foolish man. Besides, the man named Tylen hurriedly called out Sagunda’s name as if he had been waiting for the chance, deliberately taking his time until Sagunda took action. It was a golden opportunity to turn everything towards the one man.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then shouldn’t we interrogate him right now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor shook his head at Ian’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it’s of no use now. Today’s events have already transpired. Of course, if we interrogate him, we’re likely to get another name out of him. And in all likelihood…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor turned his head towards the group as if waiting for an answer, and Raven and Duke Lindegor both spoke at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Duke Arangis…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s correct. He should be the one who is operating things behind the scenes, the one who is threatening the empire and trying to harm Shio.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor spoke in a quiet voice, but it contained boundless anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There are already many rumors that I and the imperial army are pressuring Arangis excessively. If we connect Sagunda back to Arangis at this time, the situation in the south will certainly turn for the absolute worst. All but a few cities across the coast are under the control of Arangis. If they unite, my cities will be threatened.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone expressed sympathy with the emperor’s words by nodding their heads. The southern parts of the imperial territory had been devastated by conflict over the past 20 years. It had finally stabilized a few years ago, but the reality of the situation was a ticking time bomb that could set off at any movement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Furthermore, the majority of the powerful lords who secured the southern conflicts were blood allies who were loyal to the Arangis Duchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Currently, they were in a rather amicable relationship with the emperor and the imperial army, especially because they were rather intimidated, but it was likely that they would instantly band under the flag of the Arangis Duchy if the emperor labeled Duke Arangis as a traitor and sent the imperial forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, if the situation somehow caused a chain reaction to erupt into a series of riots in the east or the north, the entire empire would tumble down into chaos with large conflicts sweeping through its land. It was the worst possible outcome for the emperor and the empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is unfortunate, but only Sagunda and his immediate line should be held accountable for the treasonous crimes against Shio. However…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor’s spirit flared.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He spoke in a furious voice, not attempting to conceal the boiling anger from his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We cannot overlook the guilt of shamelessly showing contempt for myself and the royal successor of the great empire. I will hold Arangis accountable. I swear on the name of Aragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The intense Spirit of the Emperor heated up the office.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the four people who were gathered here were one of the only people who could maintain their composure under the emperor’s vast spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I cannot personally punish him with the imperial army, then someone else can. However, Arangis is strong, and there are only a few who can challenge him, and even fewer that I trust…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor continued, turning his eyes towards a certain person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, Duke Pendragon, I will leave it to you. For your loyalty towards Aragon, no… Would you take upon my personal favor?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s heart throbbed. He felt his blood start to boil at the emperor’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The master of the great empire was asking him, requesting of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded firmly after meeting the eyes of the emperor, which burned brightly due to his spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the name of Pendragon, I will accomplish it.”</span></p>
