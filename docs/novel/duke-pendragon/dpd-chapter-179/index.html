 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“But Sir Isla, since then, Sir Killian has become an even more outstanding and brilliant knight. Thanks to that, the knight order is coming along nicely as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Irene spoke with a gentle smile in an attempt to change the atmosphere, and Mia nodded her head in agreement, all the while eagerly chewing her food.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The image of the two sisters’ actions put a smile on everyone’s faces regardless of their status and gender. The presence of two beautiful ladies in the official residence was like a spring breeze. Otherwise, it would be a den full of expressionless soldiers and knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“The lady is right. It is all thanks to the lord that Sir Killian was able to break his big ego.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Yes, yes! Of course, that goes without saying!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Irene blushed and agreed wholeheartedly with compliments about her brother. However, Raven shook his head lightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It is all because Sir Killian is a truly loyal knight to the Pendragon Duchy. Would he have been able to become such a man if he had possessed an untrue heart?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven spoke in a gentle voice. However, it contained profound meaning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven saw many knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Most of them were from noble backgrounds and tended to be arrogant and selfish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The imperial knights were a little better. It was truly difficult to become a knight of an imperial regiment, and all of them were bold warriors who were hardened in the battlefield. They pledged their allegiance to the empire and the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They deserved to be proud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">However, ordinary knights, those commonly referred to as ‘territorial knights’, were different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They were handed their titles on a silver platter from generation to generation, and they held absolute power over the people of the territory they oversaw. Inside their land, they were no different from kings. Moreover, they hardly experienced any proper battles, so they were ignorant to the fact that there were many people much stronger than them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They were truly frogs in a well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">So even though they were knights, they evaluated everyone else based on status and ranking instead of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When Raven first met Killian in Conrad Castle, he thought Killian to be just like the rest – A shameless man who boasted his status even though he was incompetent. Raven thought him to be a third-rate knight of a fallen duchy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Such judgement led to Raven breaking one of Killian’s eggs. It was a strong countermeasure. If Killian had collapsed, it would have proven his incompetence and Raven would have thrown him away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It was a fallen duchy anyways, and one less knight was not going to make a significant difference anyways.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But Killian did not collapse. He was a completely different person from most of the territorial knights Raven had seen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After suffering such a large humiliation as a man, Mark Killian abandoned his pride and stuck to his duties and responsibilities as a knight of the Pendragon Duchy. He accepted the results like a man, and once again swore allegiance to his lord and to his land as a faithful knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He was a pure, loyal man who was truly a diamond in the rough. That was the Mark Killian Raven saw, the knight of the Pendragon Duchy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“You should know after seeing many knights over the different territories, but a figure like Sir Killian is very rare.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven looked around at the quietened banquet hall before slowly continuing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“He does not covet wealth. He swears his loyalty to the duchy and I as a knight. It was not because I enlightened him that he made a large leap. He was such a person from the very beginning.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The atmosphere became solemn at Raven’s words, and Isla nodded softly. Isla had also figured &nbsp;out Killian’s character after being punished together, although he would die before holding hands again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“So it is not Sir Killian who should be thankful to me, but rather, I who should be thankful to Sir Killian. I am grateful that he has stayed with me as my knight and a knight of the Pendragon Duchy. I am grateful that he pushes himself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven would have been embarrassed to say such words before, but it wasn’t so anymore. If it were not for Killian, he would never be able to leave the duchy behind and be in Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In the past, Raven Valt was a man who fought alone to survive, but the Raven Valt of now knew that he was not alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven now knew. Killian, as well as everyone else here, was the foundation that allowed him to exist, as both Alan Pendragon and Raven Valt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“My lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Isla stood up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He bowed his head while receiving everyone’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“My thoughts fell short. I was the one who was conceited. Sir Killian is a true knight of the lord and the Pendragon Duchy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“No. Sir Killian, Sir Isla, and Leon… Every knight of mine is precious. So do not say such words.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Isla looked up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">His eyes were full of passion and loyalty towards his trusting master.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hmm…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Feeling a little embarrassed, Raven glanced away. But another pair of burning eyes were waiting for him as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“My lord! I, I will live as your knight until I die! N, no, actually, even in death, I will live on as a knight of the Pendragon Duchy!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Leon cried out in a loud voice. It seemed like he was on the verge of crying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It seemed that Leon was touched when he was mentioned by Raven as well, even though he fell way short of Killian and Isla.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ehem! I, I got it! Well, should we go out now? Our friend is waiting for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven spoke in a confident tone, but inwardly felt a little embarrassed. He rose from his seat and moved his steps.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Thud!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>All of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;regiment knights and soldiers from other tables stood up simultaneously as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Let us escort you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The men of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;regiment moved to the sides of Raven. From the looks on their faces, it seemed that all of them had been moved just as much as Leon and Isla.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Hm, well… do as you please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven hurriedly walked out while receiving burdensome gazes from dozens of men. Those who remained behind looked at the back of the group with blank expressions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“This is my first time seeing grown-up men acting like that…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Marilyn whispered in a low voice, and the women standing next to her whispered in unison.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I know, right? But somehow, don’t you feel a little riled up as well?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“You are right. I feel a little jealous too…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But all the whispering women had gentle smiles on their lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Keung! Why don’t you hurry up a little.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I had some things going on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Karuta spoke in a sulky tone while standing amongst a group of orcs, and Raven replied with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Let’s get started now. I can finally warm up. It’s been too long. Keuheung!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Karuta breathed out a gust of air as his steel club hit the floor. Orc Fear began to rise from his whole body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hm…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The expressions of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;regiment soldiers and knights changed at the sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">They were considered an elite force and they frequently encountered the island orcs, but they had never faced such a strong Orc Fear before. In addition, Karuta was two or three heads taller than other orcs, which magnified his intense presence by several times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Isla.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Yes, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At Raven’s words, Isla approached and politely held out two swords. Raven took the two blades and started walking forward in a leisurely manner. He held Widow’s Cry, the Pendragon family’s heirloom, in one hand and a crescent-shaped scimitar in the other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He stopped when he neared Karuta. Someone gulped at the sight of the two warriors’ standoff. It was reminiscent of David facing goliath. There was a huge disparity between the two’s physique.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone could not help but wonder if the two small blades in Raven’s hands could stop the gigantic steel rod.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hey, Pendragon scarecrow. This time, just like the old days…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“First of all, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ke, keung?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Karuta’s face distorted at the sudden remark.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Your whole body must have been itching to fight properly, so I sincerely appreciate that you have trusted me and waited thus far. The Ancona Orcs are true friends of the Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After speaking, Raven gave a light bow to Karuta.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Huh…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone observing the two were quite surprised to see an imperial duke and the governor of Leus bowing to a mere orc. But Karuta’s reaction was even more surprising.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Keu, Ehem! E, even if you say such words, I will not go easy on you! Orcs try their best in every fight!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He raised his voice, but he was obviously embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A shy orc warrior with such hideous appearance…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Among the shocked silence, Raven broke into a sly grin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I know. It is the orc’s virtue and law to fight any opponent to their heart’s extent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“…Yes, I am glad you know.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Karuta’s smiling fangs flashed in the morning sun. Then, his spirit, which had momentarily stalled, began to cover his body more intensely than before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Anyways, since you said thank you, I, Karuta, am going to have a good time today!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Fwoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Orc Fear of the strongest Ancona warrior pushed back the winter air and heated up the entire yard. The flippant spirit quickly formed into a sharp fang and ferociously thrust towards its target.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At the same time, a threadlike blue spirit slowly began to rise against the Orc Fear from the shoulders of Raven. However, the whole scene was reminiscent of a small ship about to face an oncoming typhoon. It was so fragile that it looked like the Orc Fear would completely dominate and swallow it up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hm…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The eyes of the onlookers were filled with tension. However, their expressions slowly changed and the eyes filled with wonder. The weak and precarious looking spirit had begun to slowly push back the Orc Fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">CraaaackI</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The sound of glass cracking seemed to resound, but no one could tell if it was real or just an auditory hallucination.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As the sound exploded…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Kukuukkat!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Karuta burst into laughter that seemed to shake the sky and the earth, then he jumped while leaving behind a trail of red glow from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At the same time, Raven let out a short, sharp breath between his lips, then sprang towards Karuta as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Widow’s Cry, containing the Spirit of the White Dragon, clashed with the huge steel club.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As the spirits clashed, strong winds rose in the yard as if a typhoon had descended. Such an enormous reaction was caused from one clash.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone except Isla stumbled back and clenched their eyes unknowingly. Some of the soldiers even fell backwards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The shockwave created by the clash was not something an ordinary human could handle. On one side was Karuta, an orc warrior transcending physical limits. On the other side, Raven charged with the Spirit of the White Dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But the two figures’ fight was only beginning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Whoosh! Ssshhh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">he sounds were enough to cause goosebumps to rise on the skins of the bystanders, and their eyes struggled to keep up with the collision of the red and blue lights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Shiiing! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Raven parried and dodged the flurry of attacks. He could feel a cold shock on the wrist. Orcs truly lived up to their reputation for possessing great power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">If his sword was not bearing the Spirit of the White Dragon, his wrist would have been broken instantly. Above all, Karuta was very swift, unbefitting of his large frame.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It was not solely due to their power that orc warriors could beat up large bears and lions with their bare hands. It was because they had instinctive reflexes equal to predators.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In addition, they possessed superhuman strength and speed. Humans would be no match for orcs unless they were experienced and could utilize spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Kakang! Klang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Iron clashed shouted joyfully. But for those who were watching, they could only make out sounds of death that caused their hairs to stand on end</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Along with another shockwave, the two fighters separated from each other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Krrr….!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Karuta’s large eyes were glowing bright red. Raven was not his enemy, but Karuta was still in a frenzy. He had attacked with power that would have dominated the knights of Conrad Castle. He was confident that even Isla or Killian would have struggled under the barrage. But even so, he had not been able to deal any damage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It wasn’t solely due to the White Dragon’s Spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">This was a training session.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Therefore, he knew that Raven had not shown the full extent of the Spirit of the White Dragon, just as he had not roused his Orc Fear to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Then in the end…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Krrrrrukk! As expected of Pendragon scarecrow. You are probably the strongest of all the baby-toothed scarecrows.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In anger, Karuta found joy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He would be able to travel through the sea and beat up other orcs with such a strong friend by his side. He would be able to declare the Ancona tribe as the strongest orcs. Moreover, Karuta realized why Rave agreed to the battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Orcs were beasts of blood, and they had to continuously battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The struggle was an instinct for the orcs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But after months of suppressing such urges, all of the Ancona Orcs, including Karuta, were on the verge of exploding. At such a moment, the master of Pendragon accepted a fight with him, the one who accepted the orcs as his friends.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As a friend of the orcs, it was the greatest courtesy and consideration.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Keuuuuuhuehehehahaha…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Karuta burst out into laughter at the unbearable joy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hey, Pendragon scarecrow. You thanked Karuta earlier, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I did.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Realizing that Karuta was enjoying the fight, Raven replied with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Keururuk! Karuta thanks you too! The earth god will bless you forever!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As if to beat such a grateful friend to death, Karuta’s giant frame once again leaped towards Raven.</span></p>
