 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay’s face lit up even more after she finished speaking, and she changed the topics immediately, as if she was embarrassed at what she had just said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I think we are short on hands. I will help out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Not at all, baroness!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn became startled and carefully dissuaded Lindsay, who was about to roll up her sleeves. But Lindsay shook her head with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s okay. It seems like you’re underhanded due to the friends from Ancona. I can help out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even still, I…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Ring Ring Ring!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bell on the kitchen wall rang loudly and interrupted her words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a sign that breakfast would start soon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“O, oh my! Now, now! Everyone, hurry up!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shock jolted Marilyn into hastily giving instructions to the ladies. Then she turned her head and realized Lindsay was still here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The situation was quite urgent, but it wasn’t like she could ask Lindsay to help.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t mind anything, so let me help out. Even in Conrad Castle, I always helped out with the kitchen work during breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn was forced to sigh and nod her head. What else could she do in this situation? It wasn’t as if she could refuse the words of the governor’s wife, and the situation was urgent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“T, then… Forgive me, I will borrow your hands, baroness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course. Ah, I can finish the soup. It’s for the Ancona warriors, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“T, that’s right, baroness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A young maiden was struggling to stir a huge pot that was large enough to fit two or three healthy men. It was so tall that she had to stand on a chair to be able to reach the spurtle. She bowed her heads restlessly when Lindsay asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lady Conrad, that might be a little difficult…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn spoke anxiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was difficult work, sure, but most importantly, Marilyn could not imagine the governor’s wife doing such chores.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Lindsay shook her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s okay. I used to do this all the time in Conrad Castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay rolled up her sleeves bravely and stepped up on the chair. She proceeded to stir to soup with experienced motions in order to prevent it from clumping.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh my…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Lindsay had large chests, she had a small, slender figure overall. Everyone was surprised that she could easily handle the tool to stir such a large pot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmmm!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay sniffed, then turned her eyes to the kitchen table. There was a pile of smoked, lean lamb.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“May I put some of that in?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, yes, yes. Of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was to be used in soup or with bread, so Marilyn nodded her head right away. Lindsay grinned as she poured in large chunks of chopped lamb into the pot with a large spatula.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Ancona warriors like to have a lot of meat in whatever they eat. They don’t mind if it is fish. They will love it even if you just grill the whole thing and serve it. And even though they are not picky, they are not fond of strong spices. You don’t need any pepper, just a little salt.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh! I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn’s expression brightened at once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Salt was common in Leus because of its nature as a port city, but some spices, including pepper, were quite expensive. Their exorbitant prices had caused Marilyn to worry about food costs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Therefore, it was quite fortunate that the Ancona Orcs did not require any other spices than salt in their food. They were the biggest eaters in the whole residence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, it was even more pleasant to hear that they ate fish as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leus was full of fish, even in the winter, and it didn’t take long to prepare grilled fish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Come to think of it, we have quite a few pollacks and perch left over from five days ago…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A woman started speaking excitedly, then soon blurred her words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The food would not have gone bad because of the cold weather. Besides, she had removed all the organs to prevent it from going bad. However, she couldn’t give the orcs something that she wouldn’t put out for humans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, there were more than a hundred fish in the storage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Lindsay nodded with a bright face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That will be good. Orc warriors grill fish to eat even five days after they catch it, and in mid-summer as well. Furthermore, the forest where the Ancona warriors lived was far from the ocean, so they wouldn’t have tried sea fish before. I think they will love it, why don’t you bake it right away?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn turned her head at Lindsay’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pollacks! Perch! Bring it all! Hurry up!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ladies resounded an immediate answer, and dozens of fish began to be baked in skewers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Oh my! You’ve truly saved us, baroness! The 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment soldiers burst in so frequently that we bought large amounts of the fishes, but they haven’t been coming these days, so we had a lot left over. I was worried about what we were going to do with them, but you solved it in one go! Oh ho ho ho ho ho!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling a little more comfortable with Lindsay, Marilyn let out a laughter while bowing her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t mention it. I am so glad that it helped.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay’s embarrassed smile caused smiles to bloom on the faces of the other women.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they first got caught making a joke about her, they thought they would be fired from the kitchen and be punished by the governor-general.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most of the women here were able to work in the kitchen thanks to their husbands’ jobs at the official residence. However, they were caught making fun of the wife of the governor, who was also a duke of the empire. It was a felony that could result in their entire family losing their jobs. Such events were common when Sagunda was governor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the pretty lady named Lindsay Conrad was different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite her high status as the wife of a duke, she was not arrogant, and she did not treat anyone carelessly. She was different from immature ladies who considered themselves great and acted sympathetic towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since entering the kitchen, Lindsay had never acted as she wanted, or spoken rashly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She always made sure to ask Marilyn beforehand, and she asked for Marilyn’s understanding as well. This meant that she recognized Marilyn as the owner of the governor residence’s kitchen, not just as a simple employee.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The kitchen was a woman’s sanctuary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No woman would be happy to have another woman come into her kitchen and play master. Perhaps it did not apply to nobles who were served food on a golden platter since birth, but it was a very sensitive and important topic to those who worked in the kitchen. It held true for Marilyn as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay Conrad could do whatever she wanted in the entire residence, including the kitchen. No one would be able to resist her except the governor and his sister. Nevertheless, she did not abuse her power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was very considerate of Marilyn and the people in the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh my! Baroness, I can take care of this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Baroness! The bread is done baking. Would you like to taste it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Baroness! This is a specialty sauce that is only available in Leus. Do you think any dishes from the Pendragon family would go well with it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“E, excuse me, baroness! If you ever have some free time, could you teach me some famous dishes from the duchy?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the kitchen women, old and young, engaged in conversations with Lindsay and asked her for help. Just as Lindsay Conrad acknowledged and cared for them, they also accepted her as one of their own and the mistress of the residence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course! Anything you want. But I think I will have to spend some time with the ladies this afternoon...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay spoke in a regretful voice. An older lady continued Lindsay’s words with a sly smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And at night, you will have to spend some time with the governor-general!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course! That’s the most important thing for Baroness Conrad!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ho ho ho ho ho!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay’s face flamed up once more, and laughter flowed from the kitchen of the residence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keho! What kind of fish is this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have never had such delicious fish in my life as an orc!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The soup is good too! I chew a lot of lamb!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ancona Orcs went wild.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The meal prepared last night was inadequate to fulfil their hunger. There wasn’t enough time, so the ladies had grilled and steamed sheep and pork. But today, breakfast was abundant and scrumptious thanks to the women’s diligent preparations since dawn.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The meat wasn’t simply steamed or smoked like yesterday either. It was soaked in sauce since yesterday and prepared in conjunction with tasty ingredients. The smell of steamed fish and shellfish was enough to rouse everyone’s appetite.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t believe I’m eating meat for breakfast! Kuekuekuet! I think it’s a good thing we came out of the woods.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Earth God says that the best time to go out is after a good meal! Kuekekeu…kkukeket!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Karuta burst out into laughter at Kratul’s words. He had stuffed his mouth with three grilled fish, and his laughter soon turned into coughs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Eat slowly, there’s still plenty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven shook his head while looking at the orcs with weary eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Karuta gulped down a large jug of beer at once and sent down the food stuck in his throat. He smacked the meat scraps stuck on his fangs with his thick fingers and said haughtily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heung! Orcs with big fangs eat well, and orcs that eat well fight well. Scarecrows can only nibble because they only have a baby tooth. For eating and fighting.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm, really? Then should we have a go after we finish eating? It’s been a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven grinned with an answer, and Karuta flinched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But soon, the orc stood up with a large grin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not a bad idea. Actually, my bones have stiffened because I only had Killian scarecrow to fight for the last few months.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Karuta’s gaze burned with fighting spirit, and Raven narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. I’ve heard that Killian’s skills have improved considerably, so I guess I need to give you a reward as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s gaze caused Karuta’s smile to deepen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keueng! I am full now, so I will go out first and warm up. Eat slowly and come out. Keung!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Karuta swaggered out after he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The morning’s incidence caused the employees and the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment soldiers to take on worried expressions. Karuta was the captain of the Ancona Orc warriors, and he was the biggest of them all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how renowned Raven was in his strength, they were worried whether the slender governor would be able to compete with the orc.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn, who had become quite close to Lindsay while preparing breakfast, approached Lindsay and spoke carefully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“E, excuse me, baroness. Don’t you think we should stop them?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm? Stop what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay responded with genuine curiosity, and Marilyn said in a small voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t mean to belittle the governor, but I am worried that something might happen. He needs to go to parliament today, so if anything does happen…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, you do not need to be worried about that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn was dazed by Lindsay’s smile. How could she remain so calm when her husband was about to compete with a horrifying orc?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay continued with an innocent smile on her lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once upon a time, Karuta was beaten up by the duke and bruised his face. In Conrad Castle, Sir Killian’s egg… ah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Listen quickly shut her mouth with a blush. She had almost accidentally spoken about something so shameful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Egg… what egg?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unable to understand Lindsay’s words, Marilyn tilted her head. Other employees who were waiting to serve the meals also shared curious gazes with each other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The answer to their question came from Isla, who sat across from Lindsay, eating silently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Mark Killian, the first knight of the Pendragon Duchy, has only one egg. The lord smashed one of them during a bout they had.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pfff!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon had been paying attention to the conversation as well, and he spewed out the food in his mouth at Isla’s words. He had not been expecting such words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A brief silence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>But it didn’t take long for the male employees of the residence and the soldiers of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment to start trembling while their hands reached to cover their precious parts.</span></p>
