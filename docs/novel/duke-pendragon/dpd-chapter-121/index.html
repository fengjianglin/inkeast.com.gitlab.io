 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The massive influx of people into the city due to the festival meant that the inns around the waterway were already occupied, as well as the luxury inns for rich nobles. But it was not hard for Raven’s group to find accommodation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me, sir, I’m sorry, but the empty rooms are…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They want the entire floor for four days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We will serve you to the best of our abilities.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the sight of the five gold coins Raven held out, the owner of the pub quickly cleared out the top floor which he resided in with his family for the group to stay in. The five-story pub and inn was quite neat and tidy overall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The top floor had four bedrooms and a spacious living room equipped with a blazing fireplace. It seemed quite comfortable for the group to stay in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please enjoy your stay. If you need anything, just let us know in the pub on the first floor.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The owner of the inn politely guided the group to the room before leaving. He had been paid five gold coins for one room, which was the amount that would normally come from renting out all the rooms in the inn for ten days. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While the two ladies and Leon unpacked, Raven lost himself in thought while adding more wood to the fireplace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Do I need to find Argos first? Or…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Most of the demonic army’s soldiers were vicious criminals who committed various crimes, but there were always some exceptions. Argos was one of them, and he was an exceptionally unusual case, being dragged to the demonic army at the age of&nbsp;</span><span>forty</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;eight.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a simple reason why he was sentenced to the demonic army instead of receiving the death penalty or a labor sentence. Even though he was old, he was one of the rare skilled fighters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘With Argos, I will be able to make Leon into a useful fighter. But… I don’t know if Argos will listen to me.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven seemed troubled when he recalled his old friend. Argos had been one of the only close friends he made when he served in the demonic army, but the Argos he recalled had only been alive physically.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was a man who had lost everything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven could not do anything about the situation, even though he was now the successor of the Pendragon Duchy. So now, Raven had to make sure that Argos was not sent to the demonic army while continuing to do what he set out to do.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was the only way he could save Argos while creating a capable fighter out of Leon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brother, do you have any worries?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm, it’s not…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes grew a little larger when he turned his head at Irene’s voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It did feel like it was taking too long to unpack, but the two girls had changed their clothes in the meantime. Irene wasn’t able to bring her clothes because she was running away from home, so she dressed in simple clothes she bought a few days ago. A pair of pants, a white shawl, and a short red cape for women. Thanks to her beauty, she glowed brightly with even the simplest of attires.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay was wearing a simple, modest dress, but her figure was so voluptuous that men were sure to take second glances at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Huh?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s gaze rested on Lindsay’s left breast. A gentle smile spread around Raven’s mouth when he saw the brooch he bought for her at the market.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hehe!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene dragged Lindsay’s limp arm and stood in front of Raven with their arms crossed. When the two ladies stood together, two beautiful flowers with unique charms seemed to bloom simultaneously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you think, Brother? Do you think it looks good on us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene’s dazzling eyes brought Raven back to his senses, and he answered with an awkward cough.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ehem! Oh, well… Both of you look pretty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You see? I told you my brother would say that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ye, yes… It’s all thanks to your help.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay shyly curled her eyebrows downward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, I think I’ll have to go out for a while, what will you two do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you don’t mind, we would like to go out with you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven thought for a moment. It would not be very difficult to find Argos. Among the finalists of the dueling competition, the relatively poor mercenaries and commoners would stay at the accommodation provided by the High Lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Raven thought back to the stories he heard from Argos, the fighter should already have been quite famous here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘But…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven observed Irene and Lindsay who were sitting with their hands neatly folded. They appeared calm, but seeing how fast they changed their clothes, they must have been dying to go outside, stroll the streets, and enjoy the festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded lightly, knowing that the last 15 days of the journey must have been quite boring and dull for the two girls.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then let’s go together. But both of you must cover your faces and behave yourself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He called for such measures because he knew they would be in the spotlight with Irene’s beauty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ladies answered with a bright, and they left the door alongside Raven and Leon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven found out the residence of the competition’s participants by asking the inn owner, then left the inn with the other three.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The streets beside the waterway were swarming with people.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The stalls that sold simple food and alcohol were packed with low-class commoners. The luxurious terraces were full of nobles and merchants sitting in groups, leisurely enjoying the festival.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Onlookers surrounded the cages filled with rare creatures from across the sea, and the performances of the wandering bards and acrobats’ tricks entertained the eyes and the ears of the crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look at that, Miss!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene and Lindsay looked around the sights without a break.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is an animal called the seal. Even though it looks like that, it’s quite smart. They can perform many tricks if they are trained.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon stuck to the two girls like a shadow and conversed with them. But even when he was talking, he continued to observe the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He certainly has a good sense of responsibility.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven had felt it since their first meeting, but Leon was a sincere and hard-working character. Moreover, living in the imperial castle shaped him to be quick-witted, so he quickly grasped the personalities of the two girls.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he was with Raven, he spoke less, and when he dealt with the two girls, he told funny stories befitting his family background.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon was a very different character from Killian, Isla, and Vincent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Anyways, there are quite a few figures who look dangerous.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes turned sharp as he observed the people in the streets. Most of them were ordinary, but he spotted some men who were obviously free knights or mercenaries.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They seemed to have come to participate in the jousting or the dueling competition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This way, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon did not forget to navigate their way while escorting the two girls. Raven and the ladies followed behind Leon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They saw a spacious square after walking for two more blocks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That must be it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes narrowed when he saw a building in the square that was surrounded by many people. The crowd consisted of armed men, so he deduced that the building was the accommodation for the contestants of the competitions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven looked over the building with cold eyes, then walked towards a nearby restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who do you think will win the jousting competition?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Raul, Serra’s knight, is most likely to win. They say he hasn’t lost in three years!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you talking about? It has to be Sir Romeo of the Knights of Infield. He took four people’s lives at the same time with his godly spear skill in a territorial dispute!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph! You fools. Everyone knows that His Grace Morgan is going to win the competition again. You saw it today, didn’t you? All three matches, won in a single exchange.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, what do you think about the dueling competition? It seems more thrilling and lively.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm! That’s probably because a lot of mercenaries and swordsmen enter. Besides, this year’s preliminaries had more people than last year. Of course, a duel looks more intense on the surface.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But that old fighter who defeated His Grace Eder was really great.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah! I couldn’t even see his hands and feet move!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The restaurant was already packed with people who gathered to watch the competitions. Most who passed the preliminaries already retired in their quarters to prepare for tomorrow, but they knew that some of the winners would head to nearby pubs or restaurants to show off their prowess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A young employee greeted Raven’s group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you have a table for four?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes! We do indeed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The boy noticed at one glance that the group consisted of high-class nobles, and he nodded quickly. The first floor was already full with commoners, but the second floor had some empty tables for nobles and rich merchants, which were several times more expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right this way, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The four people moved their steps under the employee’s lead.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though the two ladies were covering their faces with mesh, their beautiful eyes and fine hair could be seen. The men stole glimpses as they passed through the crowd of the first floor.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, no one dared to openly look or make obscene remarks. The pub did not house just commoners right now. On the second floor above, there were not only nobles who came to enjoy the festival, but also knights who came to participate or watch the competitions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If they accidentally messed with a noble, they would not have enough necks to spare.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But this only held true for the commoners on the first floor, and the second floor was different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ho-oh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The gazes of the various nobles crowded towards Raven’s group as the four people came up the stairs. Those who could afford the two coins per table were extremely limited, and most of them already knew each other or had become acquainted in the past few days. So it was only natural for them to be curious when new nobles appeared as the festival neared the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most importantly, the group of four people were all young, elegant people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Very handsome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know. They look very young. Which family do you think they’re from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles could hardly keep their eyes off the party.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most of the men glanced at Raven and Leon before turning their eyes to Irene and Lindsay. However, the women only stared at Raven’s face while covering their faces with fans. Even though he had and dyed his hair, his beauty and elegance were still shining through.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Not this again… tsk.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven frowned inwardly, but he did not show it. He should have been used to it by now, but it was still uncomfortable to receive the gazes of so many women.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the best menu in this place?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Irene was born a lady of a duchy and lived as such. She did not care for the gazes and spoke to the waiter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, yes. I would like to recommend the veal with mushrooms today, lady.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The waiter answered while thinking that Irene’s voice sounded like a pearl on a silver platter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I would like that with a bottle of Mondesan wine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mo, Mondesan wine?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The employee’s eyes became shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, well, lady. Mondesan wine is a little expensive.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not a little, actually.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mondesan wine was considered one of the highest quality wines, and it boasted a price that was equivalent to 10 days’ worth of food for ordinary citizens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bring it, keep the rest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will be right back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven held out a gold coin and spoke in a cold voice. The employee immediately stiffened up before bowing deeply.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene looked wide-eyed at her brother as the employee went away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it that expensive, brother? We have dozens of bottles in our castle. It’s the only wine that mother drinks as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s because your noble self was born and raised in a castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene nodded her head as if finally understanding, then hunched slightly with a sullen look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry, Brother. I didn’t know the workings of the world, so I made my brother spend a lot of money.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. You don’t have to worry about it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven smiled and stroked Irene’s hair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Irene was not just a regular noble. She was the eldest daughter&nbsp;</span><span>of the Pendragon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Duchy. How could she possibly know the value of the things she was entitled to in the castle?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was rather strange for Irene to even know about the standards of the commoners since she had never experienced it before. That was also why Raven spent money without reserve - because she was so used to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene did not complain even once during the entire trip. She enjoyed the common people’s food, and she never frowned at having to share a small room with Lindsay in the inns. No matter how elevated Lindsay’s status was now, it would be hard for Irene to share a room with someone who had been the castle’s maid until not too long ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven was proud that Irene had such a casual, friendly relationship with Lindsay.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven wasn’t the only one who thought that way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The lord and the lady are truly extraordinary…’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon’s eyes trembled when he looked at Irene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, he had thought of her as a strange, unique, spoiled lady, but during the 15 days, Irene had been a box of surprises.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She had a fairy-like appearance that was comparable to, no, that was superior to any noble ladies, and she always maintained a smile while caring for others.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, she did not hesitate to share conversations with him, even though he had revealed his identity as stemming from a family of jesters, and she was friendly with the lord’s concubine, whom he had heard served as a maid only a few months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To Leon, Irene was a fierce, wise lady who was unlike any other typical noble ladies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Ehem</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! Would you excuse me for a moment?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Someone coughed and initiated a conversation with the group.</span></p>
