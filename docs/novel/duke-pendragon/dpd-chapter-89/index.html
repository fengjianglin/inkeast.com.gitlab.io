 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ha…, hng, hnnngh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sad cry of a girl showed no signs of stopping. She was wearing plain travel clothes while riding on the back of a shabby horse. But the people who were in front of her and behind her only glanced at her with irritated expressions and said nothing to her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was because the pretty-faced girl was the youngest daughter of one of the Empire’s 13 High Lords. Or at least, she was, until yesterday.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A girl of such status was reduced to a mere maid of another territory and riding a crummy pony. She must have felt like the sky was collapsing on her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But not everyone who was accompanying her was considerate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop crying. If you keep crying, I’ll throw you in the stream.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hiccup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man who was at the forefront turned his head and spoke to her with an indifferent look. The girl immediately stopped crying in a fit of surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hic! Hic!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The girl carefully glanced at the young man with fearful eyes as her weeping turned into subdued hiccups.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the young man turned his head forward once more and rode his horse disinterestedly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The trembling girl’s head fell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I, I’m so scared. Sob! Father, mother…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tears streamed out of her eyes, but Sophia Bresia forced herself to not make any sounds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She did not know how she ended up in this position…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was sorrowful and scared, but her body ached, and she felt tired. They had moved without rest for five days straight, except for when it was time to eat and sleep. She felt horrible as she was not used to riding horses, and because she did not catch enough sleep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the past, she would have become angry and thrown all sorts of fits. But she definitely could not do that in front of the handsome, but cold-hearted young man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he said he would throw her into the stream, he was someone that would really do so. He was the heir to the Pendragon Duchy, Alan Pendragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alan Pendragon was a strange and scary person, contrary to his handsome face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She could not understand how one of the highest-ranking nobles who was set to become a duke, was bearing through such a rough lifestyle without complaint. He had a knight and a dragon by his side, but he still insisted on doing everything himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was good at hunting, starting a fire, and he even personally cooked a few times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In fact, the hare stew he made in a large pot yesterday was more delicious than any food she had in&nbsp;</span><span>Bresia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moreover, he talked casually and joked around with the mercenaries, who were heavens apart from him in terms of status. And that was one of the reasons why Sophia felt so sad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the small group consisting of eight people, only she had never heard a kind word from His Grace Pendragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your grace! There’s a fork in the road about two miles ahead, and there is a pub located there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, it is lunchtime, so let’s get some rest there. Good work, Scylla.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heehee! Don’t mention it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia had a jealous expression watching the female mercenary grin with a red face in response to Alan Pendragon’s compliments. He had never said such words or shown such an expression to herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please pay attention to your facial expressions, Lady Bresia.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huck!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia turned her head in surprise to the sudden voice that was heard from her side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the oldest of the mercenaries that was accompanying Alan Pendragon. He was looking at her from the side with a smile on his face. He continued in a subtle voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You were envious of Scylla just now, were you not? Because His Grace Pendragon treated her kindly?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She wanted to deny his words and yell at the lowly mercenary for daring to stick his nose into someone else’s business, but she knew from the past few days that she should not do such a thing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You are upset about what I just said, aren’t you?&nbsp;</span><span>Kekeuk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! But you still can’t make that sort of expression. His Grace Pendragon doesn’t like it when you make such facial expressions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, what do you mean.. by that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jody’s words piqued her interest, and she carefully asked the mercenary. Jody moved his horse closer to Sophia and spoke in a very soft voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“People can’t always be in a good mood. But when my lady is in a bad mood, it’s too easy to see it from your expression. I don’t think you know it, but it is easy to tell when you’re looking down on other people.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, what? When did I…Ah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia started to raise her voice, then stopped her words. The mercenary had thrust forward an object as if he had been waiting. It was a mirror, and she could see the reflection of her ugly face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you understand? When you look at yourself in the mirror, you see your own pretty and kind face. But when you are dealing with others, especially those that are lower in status than you, you take on this kind of expression. And His Grace Pendragon has consistently seen this expression.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia’s eyes started quivering and her face became pale.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You will have to practice maintaining your facial expression quite a bit before we get to the Pendragon territory. There’s no way that the duchess and the ladies will miss out on something that even His Grace sees. Then...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait, hold on… please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia hurriedly called out as Jody bowed his head and moved away. He was the first person who properly engaged with her in a conversation throughout the trip.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She wanted to talk more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I… I’ve never done that before… you see. So, I do not know what kind of expression I should be making….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at Sophia speak hesitantly, Jody approached her with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have already gotten a lot better. How you spoke just now, that is where you should start.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“….Sorry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia showed confusion at Jody’s strange words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lady, do you know what my name is?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uh…..n, no… I don’t.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Then what about the names of the maids in&nbsp;</span><span>Bresia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Castle?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, just a few…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her voice shrank as she answered. No one had asked her such questions before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jody’s smile became even brighter at her response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My name is Jody. Please find out all the names of the people in this group. By the time we arrive in Pendragon territory, you will have already changed a lot without needing to practice.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She still did not understand how that could help, but she did not feel any apprehension towards his words, even though it was coming from a mere mercenary. For some reason, she felt like she could be treated like the female mercenary from His Grace Pendragon if she followed his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She felt her mood lighten for the first time since she began this journey, and she called out after nodding her head. She continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, Jody…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t mention it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jody grinned at the sight of Sophia’s awkward and embarrassed smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And a smile also hung on the face of the person that was listening in on their conversation – Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected, he was right about his intuition.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mercenary Jody was a man who had more than just a good hunch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a meal and a short rest at the pub, the group set off once more. The road, the weather, and the members of the party were the same as before, but everyone could tell that one thing had changed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sigh and cries could no longer be heard. And to everyone’s surprise, the person who was no longer crying, initiated an awkward conversation with Leo.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“E, excuse me… Sir Leo Ramelda…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, yeap?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo was greatly surprised when Count Bresia’s daughter, who had never even properly looked at him before, spoke to him while calling him with a title.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“May I please ask a favour from you…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, please tell me whatever you need.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For Leo, Sophia was still the youngest daughter of the High Lord, so he straightened his back and responded to her question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those mercenaries over there. Have you been familiar with them for a while?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, you mean Jody and his companions. The three of them were together for a while, but I only got to know them recently. They came to our village along with His Grace Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. Then they already knew His Grace Pendragon…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. His Grace said that he met them for the first time in Elma. He did not like them at first, but at the main streets of Elma they… ah, umm, ehem!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo became excited that the High Lord’s daughter was speaking to him, and he started to yap away before coughing awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia, too, bowed her head with an awkward expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This entire situation had originated at that very moment in Elma.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ehem! A, anyways. From my understanding, His Grace has taken a liking to the group since then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well I see. Is that something His Grace Pendragon told you personally?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. I heard this from Sir Isla, over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo carefully turned his gaze, and Sophia followed his eyes and turned her head. The young knight of Valvas who had tanned skin and combed hair, was as difficult as Alan Pendragon for Sophia. He was a scary person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, Sophia noticed something strange and tilted her head. The knight named Elkin Isla was a man of few words, and he did not speak unless he was spoken to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo noticed Sophia’s puzzlement and answered her concerns.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Isla usually does not talk much, but when I asked him about His Grace Pendragon, he told me many things, although it’s mainly about how strong and brilliant His Grace Pendragon is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not strange for a knight to boast about his lord, but Leo had never seen anyone as outspoken as Isla when talking about his master. At first, Leo thought that Isla was trying to earn favor in his lord’s eyes by saying such words, but now he did not think so at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From the last few days, Leo had gotten to know that Elkin Isla was a man of few words, and that he never lied. He was loyal and sincere about his admiration for his lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If it were the words of His Grace Pendragon, Leo had no doubt that Isla would even jump into the fiery depths of hell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a different level of loyalty that could never be seen in a relationship between a regular lord and his knight. Moreover, His Grace Pendragon had absolute trust in his knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For Leo, who had served a man like Baron Nobira, the sight was amazing, and he felt somewhat envious as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Someday, I’ll..’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soon, he would become the successor to the lord of an independent territory. When that time came, he wanted to have someone like Elkin Isla as his knight. But before that, he needed to become a person like His Grace Pendragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Someday, for sure… I will…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo’s eyes filled with determination as he looked at the back of Raven, who was talking to Isla in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia’s eyes slightly quivered as she looked at Leo’s solemn face. He was just one of dozens of respectable people that her father had under him, but somehow, and now, she saw him in a different light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Hehe! I have a hunch, a hunch! Is this what they call youth? Hehe.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A vulgar smile hung around Jody’s mouth as he looked at the two people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We will be in the territory of Seyrod soon, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ten days… that took a while. It was about 130 miles, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. There were seven gates, and three cities with populations of over ten thousand. High Lord Count Canberra of Goran had quite an overwhelming force.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even in terms of population they had four or five times more than us, so it’s only natural.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven responded to Isla, but his expression was quite grim.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They had passed through two great territories after leaving Sisak, but the great territories of the empire were bigger and stronger than he had initially thought.</span></p>
