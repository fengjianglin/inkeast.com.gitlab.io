 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But not everyone had come to become city officials.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Romeo was about to close the doors when a voice called out to him. As soon as he turned his head, he took on a bewildered expression. One of the most beautiful women he had seen in his entire life was standing in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My name is Luna from the Seyrod family. Is there something going on at the governor’s residence today?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, yes! Today is the day when the governor-general is picking out his city officials.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna’s beauty caused Romeo to stutter his words and the other employees were also dazed as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. What should we do? It might be a little difficult today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna spoke with a voice of regret after turning around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just as luck would have it… It is unfortunate, but it seems like there is nothing to be done.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baltai, who tagged along to the residence with Rollo and Carlin, licked his lips in disappointment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna turned towards Romeo once more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you anyways. I will come back tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna turned away at the thought that she should not interfere with important matters. In the first place, he might consider it rude for her to have shown up without prior warning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, excuse me, my lady, but what brings you here…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Romeo called out as Luna turned around to leave. Rollo stepped out first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lady Luna is the oldest daughter of the Great Territory of Seyrod. She is related to the Duke of Pendragon. Of course, she has maintained a great relationship with the governor since childhood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, no, that’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna hurriedly tried to deny that they had a relationship, but Romeo spoke a little faster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A relationship! Just as I expected!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Romeo looked at Luna as if he had anticipated her connection to Alan Pendragon. He had thought it a little unusual for her to be such a great beauty and act with such elegance, so it was only natural that a lady of such prominence had a relationship with the governor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Romeo saw the lady sigh regretfully, he felt sympathy for her. Even though it was only ptemporary, he was the butler of the residence. Hence, Romeo decided to do something for the governor and the beautiful lady.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me, Lady Seyrod, the governor-general is hosting a feast for the city official candidates in the afternoon. Why don’t you come back then? I will let the governor know of your visit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah… I would really appreciate it if you could.” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna smiled shyly. Anyone could see that she was delighted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The smile once again struck the hearts of Romeo and the employees, so much that they could not see Baltai share an ominous glance with the other two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Hehe! This is great.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Today was better than tomorrow, and things would be much easier if it was a dinner party with a lot of people. The assassination was much more likely to succeed with a large crowd and it provided a safe cover for the getaway as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The big boss will be very pleased. Guhahahaha!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baltai stopped himself from bursting out into laughter and followed behind Luna.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those who are next, please get ready.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Five men lined up at Leon’s words, unable to hide their tension. All the applicants had an interview with the governor in groups of five.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon searched the applicants one by one. It was to prepare for any contingency.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After confirming that there was nothing wrong, Leon knocked on the door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soon, the door opened, and the men entered the governor’s office.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The applicants could not help but be shocked at the sight that awaited them in the office. Someone unexpected was standing next to Raven. They had already anticipated the presence of Isla, but the grinning man who was standing on the other side was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How are you all doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was a middle-aged knight with a big grin on his face. It was Viscount Moraine, the commander of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;imperial regiment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to understand why Viscount Moraine was in the governor’s office, especially in an interview to pick out city officials. In addition, even though Viscount Moraine was smiling, it was hard not to be intimidated as he was a rugged, bulky man with a tough-looking face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Everyone was well aware of the actions Viscount Moraine and the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment took after the death of Count Sagunda.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, not everyone was frightened by his presence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes glistened for a moment as he looked over the five applicants. Unlike four of them, who shook at the presence of Viscount Moraine, one man was standing upright. At first, he had displayed surprise like the others, but he had quickly regained calm. He was a man in his mid to late 20s and he had brown skin and curly black hair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, he had black pupils, which was rarely seen in the people of the empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I sincerely welcome you for applying to become Leus’ officials. The interview is simple. First, state your name and place of origin, and if you have a letter of recommendation, submit it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla stepped forward, and two men moved towards Isla to hand over letters of recommendation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! I forgot to say. I say this just in case…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven continued while drawing the jolted expressions of the applicants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyone who is related to Sagunda by blood or worked as an official in a dishonest way when Sagunda was governor, speak now, or go out through this door. If you get caught later, you will be sentenced to a year in prison and have all of your property confiscated. Isn’t that right, commander?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, if I could have my way, I would catch all of them and wring them dry of blood, but since the governor specifically asked of me, I will comply.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The men who were about to hand in their recommendations froze on the spot as Moraine spoke with a huge grin, revealing his white teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The brief moment of silence felt like eternity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then Isla proceeded to walk towards the door opposite of where the applicants came in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic">Creaak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Isla opened the door, the men took turns nervously glancing at Raven and Viscount Moraine, then proceeded to walk towards the door altogether.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, the men had no choice but to hold their breath and retreat after leaving the door. Knights and soldiers of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment were lining both sides of the corridor outside the door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uh…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The men were not complete fools, so they noticed that they had fallen into a clever trap. They bowed their heads deeply and stepped outside of the residence while avoiding the eyes of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment’s soldiers and knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven observed the disappearing men with meaningful eyes, then turned his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected, only the man with the black hair remained, the one who had not been particularly daunted by the sight of Viscount Moraine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, then… We have one person left, so shall we get to it? Tell me your name and place of origin.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, your excellency. My name is Cedric Zabu. I am originally from Moguli. I arrived at Leus Harbor 11 years ago and worked as a porter until three years ago. Then, in the port guard…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man started to introduce himself without hesitation, even though his voice was a little shaky. Looking at the young man speak, Raven and Viscount Moraine exchanged glances and nodded satisfactorily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It had been Raven’s plan to bring Viscount Moraine to the interview.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he was briefed by Ian in the imperial castle about the situation in Leus, it was impossible for Raven to fully grasp the reality here with only Isla and Leon. Moreover, even though the governor ruled the city, he could not do everything by himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he did not have competent nobles or officials supporting him, the city’s situation would only get worse. But that did not mean he could just pick out random nobodies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven disliked cowardly traitors, and he could accidentally elect corrupt officials who ruled under Count Sagunda while taking bribes. It would definitely cause the public opinion to worsen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>So Raven chose to have Viscount Moraine next to him during the interview. As the man responsible for capturing more than 50 officials and nobles by directing the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment, Viscount Moraine was sure to have the required information and discernment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Naturally, the people arrested by Viscount Moraine were direct relatives of Sagunda or central figures in the government. There was no way he would know the faces of low-level officials who were not very important.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But a man who was scared of turtles would panic at the sight of a pot lid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The corrupt officials from Sagunda’s reign must have come back to take their place when they heard that the new governor was picking out city officials. However, knowing the fates of those related to Sagunda, they would have become frightened when they saw Viscount Moraine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was only possible because less than a day had passed since Raven met Viscount Moraine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the conversation held between the two men had become known to the outside world, none of the past officials would have shown up when Raven announced the recruitment of city officials.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, Raven’s plan provided the benefit of discovering people who had talent but no backing or bribes, while sorting through the corrupt officials who had served under Count Sagunda.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… So if I were to work at the port import and export administration…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pass.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“S, sorry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cedric had been in the process of eagerly answering a few questions that followed after his introduction when Raven interjected. He opened his eyes wide, wondering if he heard wrong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I said you passed. There will be a feast held in the afternoon, so wait in the sitting room and attend. If you come back to the residence after four days, I will bestow you an official position.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cedric’s mouth opened little by little, and he bowed deeply with an excited expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, your excellency! I will work hard and do everything I can for you and for Leus!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course you should. Then, I will see you later.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What about the available troops?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All the knights and soldiers have gathered with the exception of guards. The vigilantes of the villages and a portion of troops from Bellint Gate are also on standby as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. We will start the operation simultaneously at noon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Understood! None of those who dare to mess with our duchy shall survive today’s encounter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Killian raised his voice while thumping his chest at Vincent’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The black and blue bruises on Killian’s one eye seemed a little ridiculous, but Vincent nodded calmly. He knew too well what had caused the countless bruises that decorated Killian’s body and face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘You have gotten stronger, Sir Killian.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Killian had been battling with Karuta for several months already. Dueling with the strongest Ancona Orc caused Killian to improve leaps and bounds. Furthermore, he took out his anger(?) from the battles with Karuta on his subordinates under his command, causing the skills of the soldiers and the knights to improve dramatically as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In turn, all of the troops under Killian never received a chance to relieve the stress from their hellish training, which felt like real battle to them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So once they heard that they were on their way to take care of those who took over some of the villages of their duchy, their morale pierced through the skies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now, come on everybody! Hey boys! We’re moving out!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uwooooh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The elite troops of the Pendragon Duchy roared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent smiled furtively at the sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had planned the operation, but the command was handed over to Killian, as Killian was the first knight of the Pendragon Duchy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Raoul! The first squadron will raid the Lowpool slums! Sir Mithra! The second squadron will oversee the roadside at the gate in conjunction with the centaurs!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Killian would do well to fill the vacancy of Duke Pendragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Ron, there is a letter from York Town.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A soldier rushed over and handed him a letter with a red seal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“From York Town? This is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent’s eyes narrowed. The seal on the letter belonged to the Seyrod County.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It must be from Lady Seyrod. Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent tilted his head curiously. There was no reason for Luna to write to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Hmm!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent was nicknamed the smiling raccoon because he always had a meaningful smile under any circumstances. However, the smile disappeared from his face as he read the contents of the letter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Noticing Vincent’s shock, Killian asked with a grimace in one eye.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Ron, what's wrong? What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is terrible. I need to contact the duke…! N, no, I will head there myself right now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent threw the letter towards Killian and ran towards the griffon pen without waiting for an answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh…?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Killian picked up the letter with a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In Luna’s own handwriting, a name could be identified in the letter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Toban Baltai</span></p>
