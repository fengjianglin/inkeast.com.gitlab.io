 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, hello there!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna entered the office of the embassy that was prepared by Vincent. Waiting for Luna was a man in his early 30s with a smile on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had various scars on his face, but he didn’t give off a bad impression as he maintained a smile. His overall atmosphere was quite friendly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nice to meet you, Lady Seyrod. My name is Toban Baltai from Sigilah.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man who called himself Baltai folded his waist with his hand on his left chest, which was a southern style of greeting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, yes. I am Luna Seyrod.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although his face was rather rough, Luna’s vigilance lowered slightly as he continued to smile and maintained civility. Soon, a maid brought some tea, and Luna and Baltai faced each other with a table between them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyways, you said you wanted to see me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, it is in regards to copper. My lord wants to purchase copper from the Seyrod family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really? From my understanding, there are several copper mines in the south, so why would he…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baltai sighed sadly in response to Luna’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haa…! It is as you say, Lady Seyrod. There are several copper mines in the south. However, the situation in the south has gotten worse again, and the owners of the iron and copper mines have stopped exporting their minerals out to others.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that so? Things must not be so good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s worse than it seems. Minerals, grains, no one is selling even at madly elevated prices, I’m dying of frustration.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The southern parts of the empire had been stabilized temporarily. However, she knew from hearing ear to ear that there were signs of conflict beginning to break out once more. But it seemed that the situation was more dire than she had thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To stock up on grain signified preparations for war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But just then! The Pendragon Duchy built a city like this. Ahh, it really is a huge relief for us!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A big grin appeared on Baltai’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The port is downstream of the river and it’s not too far from the sea, so it’s quite easy to transport goods on a sailboat. Moreover, it takes around four days to get to Leus from here, and another fifteen days to Sigilah, so it’s not much different than transporting goods by land from the south.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Most importantly! Isn’t the copper of the Seyrod family famous for its quality? So don’t worry about the price, and sign a contract with me. For now, I need about 4,000 pounds.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna lightly nodded her head.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t bad. No, rather, it was pretty good.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She could make a surplus for selling copper for a reasonable price, and the other party would be able to secure a stable supply of copper. It’s not like the Seyrod family had a shortage of copper anyways.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘But…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna felt nervous for an unknown reason. Everything proceeded so smoothly that it felt as if someone had planned it in advance. But when she saw the good-natured smile on Baltai, it felt as if she was worrying too much for nothing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then let’s do that. The market price for copper right now is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will give you an additional 20 percent of the original market price.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Are you serious?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna was shocked at the unexpected offer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baltai nodded his head with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is our first deal, so we should be showing our credibility. I hope that from now on, we can continue to trade with the Seyrod family. I will give you the payment as soon as we sign the contract.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After speaking, Baltai grabbed a pouch that was hanging from his waist and put it on the table. Dozens of gold coins could be seen glittering.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, and by any chance… I heard that Lady Seyrod and Duke Pendragon are very close. That you guys are in a relationship…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Ah, that’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna blushed a little at Baltai’s unexpected words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Somehow, she felt a little glad to be called lovers with that man, even though it was not true.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So if you don’t mind, I was wondering if you could introduce me to him sometimes. He’s a man I truly respect personally…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baltai’s polite yet restless appearance hinted that he adored Duke Pendragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It won’t be difficult to introduce you, but His Excellency is currently in Leus…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, then what do you think about this? Since I have to transport the first batch of copper to Leus anyways, why don’t you come to Leus with me in our sailboat?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna contemplated for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She missed him day and night. She waited and waited for the day when he would return to York Town. However, he had been bestowed Leus as the Governor General, and he was to be assigned to the city in a few days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She had waited for so long, and her heart broke when she realized she wouldn’t be able to meet him. She thought of heading to Leus, but there was no excuse for her to do so. She still had work to finish here as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this business trip gave her the perfect excuse. There would not be any better chances than this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eventually, Luna nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s do so. I will have the copper delivered to the port within four days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! That is just perfect! Then let us leave in four days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sure!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna stood up from her seat and walked towards her desk, leaving Baltai behind. At that time, Baltai’s gaze changed instantly as he stared at her back.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a gaze belonging to a beast staring at its prey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The largest city in the Mulade region and the second largest port city of the Aragon Empire. It was a large city with a population of 50,000 with thousands of people traveling through the port every day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, the population reached nearly 80,000 if one took into account the numerous villages along the coastline that had Ills and Lens at their center. This was taking into consideration the villages that were about a day’s distance from the two centers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leus could be considered one of the largest cities in the empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fifty percent of the exports from the empire to the south and the foreign countries gathered at Leus, and 70 percent of imports came through Leus. Thus, dozens of sailboats were always present in the sea of Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Therefore, the former governor generals of Leus were always appointed from experienced nobles with high status, and thus, nobles who were usually older. Other times, the position would go to a member of the royal family that was highly competent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Governor-General of Leus always stood at the core of the empire’s politics and received the confidence of the empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But this wasn’t the case anymore.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the first time in the history of the empire, the position of the governor general had passed onto the master of a duchy, someone who headed an independent territory, even though they were technically part of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a huge surprise that the young duke, who was about to turn 20 years old, had become the ruler of a giant metropolitan city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When is the new governor set to arrive?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard it’s supposed to be today or tomorrow. He’s supposed to be heading straight here from the imperial castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lately, most conversations in Leus usually involved the new governor, Duke Pendragon. He was set to arrive soon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whew, it’s really going to erupt into a mess when he arrives.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Definitely. It will certainly be something extraordinary. I heard that the nobles and even the caretakers of the governor’s residence feel like they are walking on thin ice every day.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles of Leus were greatly shocked when they saw the proclamation of Count Sagunda’s treason that was printed with the emperor’s seal. But shock soon turned into fear, and most of Leus’ nobles were unable to sleep as they shook in anxiety and despair. Most of them had some semblance of ties with Count Sagunda - some big, some small.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They couldn’t help but worry that the fire of treason would spread to them as well. However, the emperor had declared that he would severely punish those that left their places without permission, and all of the nobles’ land and possession were in the vicinity of Leus, so they could not escape anywhere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They could only wait calmly for the arrival of Duke Pendragon, who had already shown his prestige once in Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Knights, soldiers, it’s all going to be a huge problem, isn’t it? They all belonged to the previous governor general, I mean, that treasonous Sagunda, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All of them have been absorbed into the imperial army, right? The only person who must be delighted at the situation would be Viscount Reet Moraine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He was the commander of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment of the imperial army that was situated in Leus. He was an imperial knight who commanded 3,000 troops and twelve battleships.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In most cases, governor generals doubled as commanders of the imperial army, monopolizing not only the control of the city but also the military authority on behalf of the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, due to the nature of Leus as a port city, the command of the imperial troops was shared between the governor general and the imperial commander. Under these circumstances, the former governor generals had left the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment to defend the sea, while they appointed their own soldiers to take care of the city’s security.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With such measures, there had been little conflict between the governor and the commander regarding military authority, as each kept to their own devices. However, the situation had changed when Count Sagunda was instated as the city’s governor general.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Count Sagunda appointed one of his nephews as the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment’s battalion commander<span id="footnote-ref-152e"><a href="#footnote-152e">[1]</a>&nbsp;</span>and gave his knights key positions in the army, such as making them the captain of a battleship.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was natural that Moraine, who had been commander of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment for nearly a decade, would become furious. However, disobedience to the governor was no different from rebelling against the emperor, as the governor represented the emperor. As a loyal blade of the royal family, Moraine had no choice but to bear through it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the situation changed completely once Count Sagunda’s treason was revealed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He himself arrested Cesare, who had always acted arrogantly toward his superior while believing in his uncle, Count Sagunda, as well as the other knights that Count Sagunda placed in the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment. Then, he proceeded to demote or detain all the soldiers Sagunda had planted in the regiment over the years.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, he ordered soldiers to capture Count Sagunda’s relatives and soldiers who were in the governor’s residence and in the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus all the soldiers of Sagunda were incorporated into the imperial army and all his knights and relatives were imprisoned. Of course, the process wasn’t completely smooth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entirety of the city had fallen into chaos, and quite a few soldiers and knights were injured or killed in the process.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But none of the nobles in Leus could express their discontent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Viscount Moraine was an imperial knight and the head of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment. It was his duty to sort out the traitors who tried to poison the crown prince and deliver judgment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, Count Sagunda’s suicide was detrimental to most of Leus’ nobles, while Moraine became the only beneficiary as the commander of the imperial legion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t know if the new governor will be able to handle Moraine by himself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s true. I heard he’s just about to turn twenty…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pshh, you people! Stop flaunting your ignorance!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a few people conversed in worried voices, one man scolded them with a scowl. As everyone’s gazes headed towards him, the man spoke with a proud expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Age doesn’t matter at all. Are you all really ignorant of all the things the new governor has done up until now? Did you forget that he cut off Toleo Arangis’ arm last summer?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right! Everyone who attended the banquet kept telling that story over and over again! They said his swordsmanship was truly out of this world.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One person agreed, and others started to murmur their agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man spoke in a more triumphant voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There you go! Besides, Sagunda’s treason. Look what happened to him in the imperial castle! The new governor revealed the truth in front of the emperor himself! Is that something that any normal person would be able to do? My child is already 22 this year, but he shakes in his boots when he sees me, let alone the emperor himself!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Puhahaha!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man shook his shoulders humorously in imitation of his son, and a roar of laughter burst out from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that I think of it, you’re right! I heard he rode into battle alone and slaughtered dozens of enemies by himself. Sisak, if I recall?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They have orc warriors in the Pendragon Territory as well! Remember when he brought one along last summer?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that I’ve heard all these things, I feel like it’s Viscount Moraine we should be worried about, not the new governor.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, what began as an expression of concern for the new governor general turned into an expression of concern for Viscount Moraine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unsurprisingly, their conversation was very accurate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have received a message that the new governor general has stepped out of the castle of High Lord of Mulade, Count Orphan. He left yesterday morning, and seeing as there are no other nobles he will be meeting, he should be arriving in Leus sometime tomorrow afternoon, Your Excellency.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moraine narrowed his eyes while stroking his beard at the report of his disciplined subordinate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that so? What about accompanying troops? Don’t tell me he’s bringing a hoard of soldiers like that bastard Sagunda.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, sir. The group consists of only the new governor and a young man considered to be a knight from the duchy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He stopped stroking his beard and expressed surprise, then soon burst out into boisterous laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahahaha! As expected of a man who would do something so huge in front of His Majesty! I think I have already taken a liking to him. Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Moraine’s loyalty to the emperor was very high, as he was born into a family that served the royal family for several generations. Besides, there was no way that the emperor would entrust the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment to a man without loyalty, as Leus was one of the most important cities in the empire. The fact that he retained his position for nearly a decade spoke for itself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now then, shall we prepare to greet the new governor general? Or rather, His Excellency the Duke of the White Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After emptying a wooden mug filled with beer, Moraine jumped up from his chair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Ching!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a sharp metallic sound, thousands of soldiers turned towards the direction that their commander was walking towards, straightening their spears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment of the imperial army started its proud march to greet the new governor.&nbsp;</span></p>
