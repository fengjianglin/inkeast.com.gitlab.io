 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We deserve to die!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, please forgive us just this once.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mercenaries bowed their heads and spoke in a trembling voice. Raven looked down at them and spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I heard that you said I used underhanded methods in cutting off the arm of&nbsp;</span><span>Toleo</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Arangis in Leus.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And that the battle in Sisak was exaggerated.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two mercenaries looked down miserably.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that you’ve experienced it for yourself, what do you think? Is it exaggerated?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, no! Absolutely not!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They jerked their heads back up and responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As long as you know. Hey.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven let off a smirk while calling out. The young man hurried over from a distance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let them go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you not hear me? Release them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man felt a chill as Raven’s blue eyes pierced into him. Wordlessly, he took out his dagger and cut the rope that was binding the mercenaries. After finally being freed, the mercenaries stood up while groaning in pain from the beatings. They were hesitant to take any action, so they stood in their spots while stealing small glances at Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven glanced at Irene, then spoke to the mercenaries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Originally, your crimes would have called for the death penalty, but I would not have believed her either in her current state. So your sins of insulting the Pendragon family and being rude to my sister, let’s call it even with the beating. Any objections?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“None at all!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mercenaries were covered with bruises and felt the pain from cracks in their bones. They almost uttered some complaints but managed to hold it in and shook their heads. They were thankful that they got to avoid death, as they had shown disrespect for a direct descendant of a duchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I’m glad to hear that there are no objections. You are all free to go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you! Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mercenaries nodded their heads frantically, then climbed on the backs of their horses. Soon, they were riding off into the distance as fast as they could, not daring to look back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that the situation had been resolved, Raven turned his head and met Irene’s eyes. She flinched and slowly moved behind Lindsay’s back as if she were trying to hide. However, Raven ignored Irene, who was twirling her fingers while hiding behind his wife.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Kazzal</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes! Master Pendragon!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You know what you would have become, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kieee.. Dragon f, food.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, but since you came all this way safely with Irene, I’ll let you off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kazzal quickly raised his head at Raven’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really? Handsome Kazzal is not going to be dragon food?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, so go back to the castle and let them know Irene met up with me. You know what’s going to happen if you leak somewhere else on the way, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know! I go straight to the castle! I’m going to get snacks from little Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay. Take this with you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Raven took out some jerky from his bag and threw it at&nbsp;</span><span>Kazzal</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Got it! Handsome&nbsp;</span><span>Kazzal</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;will run without resting! While eating the delicious jerky!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After receiving the food, Kazzal ran back the way he had come from, his legs moving so fast that they were just a blur. The chaotic atmosphere calmed down somewhat after Kazzal disappeared, and Raven moved his gaze to the last issue that needed to be taken care of.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You. Where is your destination?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, well… nowhere in particular.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man raised his answer and answered in a rather awkward voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then you can come with us to a nearby village. We can talk while taking a rest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Oh, yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man’s heart started to beat faster for some reason, and he quickly nodded his head. The four people started moving again, leaving behind the increasingly cold autumn breeze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just before sunset, a group of people entered a small village, then headed into a pub to take two moderately large rooms. Irene got to share a room with Lindsay, and she was able to take a nice, warm bath after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But her heart was heavy due to her brother’s solemn silence the entire trip here. After a short rest, the four gathered in one room to have dinner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a steaming meat stew served with fresh bread and glasses of sweet wine. The food was very good. But Irene felt as if she was sitting on thorns, and she barely ate as she kept glancing at her brother.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Regardless of her constant gaze, Raven did not speak a word during the entire meal. Lindsay and the young man also ate in silence as they felt the tense atmosphere. As the awkward, uncomfortable dinner neared the end, Raven finally opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Irene.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ye, yes…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you know what you did wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“….I’m sorry, Brother. It’s all my fault.” Irene managed to respond.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though she had prepared herself, she barely kept herself from crying at the coldness of her brother’s voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are a lady of the Pendragon family. When I am not at the castle, it is your responsibility to look after Conrad Castle and the duchy. You, Irene Pendragon, have that duty as the eldest daughter of the Pendragon family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She could not find any words to say, so she bowed her head while tears formed in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But, you, who has such a responsibility, dares to leave the castle without any notice or permission? And with just one little goblin? What if something happened? Ultimately, you threw away the responsibilities and duties that you had as a Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I… I….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tears finally started to flow down Irene’s fair face from the continuous reprimands. She was in the wrong, but she could not help feel dejected at her brother’s heartless words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A heavy silence followed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tears kept flowing from Irene’s eyes, but she kept staring at the ground without moving, not daring to wipe her tears away. Raven stared at Irene for a while, then gave Lindsay a subtle look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lady, here…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay quickly took out her handkerchief and carefully held it out, and Irene wiped her tears and even her nose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Brother…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt a little sorry to see that his sister’s face had turned so haggard in a few days, even though it had always been like a bright summer flower. He thought it would only be fair to hear her out and figure out why she left the castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But you are not a child so you must have a reason why you ran away. Tell me why.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene barely spoke while wiping away her tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I wanted to go to the imperial castle with you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that all?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene hesitated for a moment. Her face turned red, and she lifted her head to look directly at Raven. Even though she was teary and haggard, she shook her head with a determined expression befitting the Pendragon family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, there is another reason. I… I wanted to know the world. Not from reading books and hearing stories, I wanted to see and experience the world. With you, Brother.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The unexpected answer surprised Raven. He knew that his sister was pretty and smart, and had a unique way of thinking, but he didn’t realize she would have these sorts of thoughts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you said, I made a huge mistake as a Pendragon. I know I cannot make any excuses for my behavior. But… I don’t want a sheltered life where I live in the castle until I’m married off to some other noble family. Of course, I would do anything to help the family, but I wanted to know more about the world before that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her eyes were still moist, but she spoke her mind clearly. Raven looked at her with a fresh outlook. Irene Pendragon was certainly different from any other noble ladies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Now that I think about it…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though she ran away from home, it would not be too difficult to find her from Conrad Castle. Even so, she passed through Bellint Gate and crossed Ronan bridge without any trouble or interception.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was clear that Elena condoned Irene’s decision and supported her from the shadows.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The duchess knows why this child left the castle.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elena was wise. There was no way she did not grasp the thoughts of her own daughter. She must have guessed everything and left the decision up to him, whether to take her along to the imperial castle or to send her back to the castle. It was his decision to make.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Truly…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like mother, like daughter. Raven gave a bitter smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that it had come to this, he had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand your thoughts. But that does not correct your mistakes. So as your brother, and as the family head…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene anxiously waited for Raven’s next words in a dispirited mood. She would be sent back to the castle. The hardships she had suffered over the past few days and the details of her first adventure seemed to flash before her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have decided to take you along to the imperial castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene widened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah….!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you wanted, see the world outside the duchy and experience it with your own eyes. I will watch over you as your guardian.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“B, brother…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene’s eyes started to fill with tears once more, but Raven continued his next words with a grim expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“However, from now on, you must follow my words under every circumstance. If something similar to today happens, I will send you back to the castle immediately.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course! Irene will obey Brother’s words! I will take care of you, Brother! I’m even good at living in the wild now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She clenched her small fist, and Raven barely managed to suppress a laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have two ladies, do you think we would sleep outside? You do not need to worry about that. By the way, do you know why I forgave you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I’m not sure…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In her heart, she screamed, ‘Because I’m the prettiest and nicest sister in the world!’, but she shook her head while feigning ignorance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The men from before. If you had not revealed your identity, and if they chased after you for other reasons, I would have punished you and immediately sent you back to the castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was obviously wrong to leave the castle without permission. But you fulfilled your duty to the honor of the Pendragon family. That is why I am forgiving you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Of course. It was the right thing to do.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She twisted her body in embarrassment, and Raven had to stop himself from laughing once more. He reminded her solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once again, such things should never happen in the future. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes! Hehe!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene grinned brightly as if she had never cried. The atmosphere brightened instantly, and Raven also smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s great, my lady!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I’m sorry, Baroness. I know you were having a very cozy time traveling&nbsp;</span><span>with Brother</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but I just stepped in and ruined everything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, no, my lady. I am fine. Now, I can take care of you from now on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really don’t have to worry about that. I will not bother you two.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“N, no, it’s nothing like that…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, yeah! Do you want a separate room?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lady Irene…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What a troublesome child. Anyways…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven looked over the two ladies with a content expression. As he looked around, a frown appeared when he noticed something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…yeah? Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man was staring at Irene with a dazed expression, and when Raven called out, he became surprised and straightened up before answering. Lindsay and Irene’s gazes also naturally turned to the young man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for helping my sister, but who are you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I, I am…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man’s body became more rigid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When those mercenaries insulted our family and you, Brother, he stood up for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really? Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven took a closer look at the young man at Irene’s words. He seemed to be around twenty years old, and he was quite handsome. He had a short moustache, obviously grown to appear older, a straight nose, and thick lips. He looked quite manly and upright.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Raven never judged anyone based on their appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When we first met, you seemed to recognize me from somewhere. Who are you, and where are you from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s low, cold voice seemed to pierce straight through, and the young man’s eyes started trembling even more.</span></p>
