 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It’s probably because of me…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be exact, it was because of the incident that occurred in Edgel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The information network between the nobles within the empire, especially with the high-ranking nobles, was extremely tight and quick.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was obvious that the incident in Edgel would have reached the ears of all the high-ranking nobles and the families of the High Lords in less than ten days. The series of events, starting from the incident in Leus with Toleo Arangis, followed by the incident regarding the third strongest territory of the empire, was sure to have shaken up the political world of the nobles. They would have realized that the Pendragon family was building a hostile relationship with the two families.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The quick-witted ones should have already figured out by seeing the events of Sisak and Leus.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The landscape of power would change depending on who would become the next crown prince, and ultimately enthroned as the next emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But now, the Pendragon family, which seemed calm from the outside, suddenly popped up from the periphery of the empire and started causing quite a stir. Moreover, they formed a friendly relationship with Prince Ian, a primary candidate as the next crown prince.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, a ripple settled down quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The majority of the nobles would have chosen to sit back and observe the situation before taking any action. It was too hasty and risky to jump into the fray and choose a side for now. They still had a lot of time remaining.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The matter with the High Lord of Alice is on another level. Especially since I basically drove his successor to death…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many of the nobles must have felt great confusion and a sense of crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone must have realized that time had come to choose a side and decide if they wanted to stand with or stand against.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This would hold even more true for the High Lords.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So they would send people over to the imperial castle to test the waters and to scour the situation. Moreover, they wouldn’t send over just any random person, but someone who had enough status to stand and the ability to make proper judgments of the situation – just like the direct descendants of the Roxan family in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, they’re entering the gate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The carriage of the Roxan family and its escorting knights started to enter the large gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Simultaneously, two soldiers who were standing by the side of the gate banged on a large drum.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm? What is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven showed confusion, and Leon answered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When a High Lord or his immediate lineage, or a noble of equivalent status passes, they hit the drums. It’s a sort of ritual.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded, thinking about the absurdity of formalities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the carriage passed the gate and the last of the knights passed as well, the sound of the drums ceased.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop! Please stop!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldiers who were equipped with unblemished, dark, cylindrical armor blocked the way into the gate with their halberds. A knight, equipped with a plate mail, walked out from the group of well-built, orderly soldiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His eyes glowed coldly after he saw the carriage and Argos, who was sitting in the coachman’s seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This gate was reserved for the royal family and the prestigious nobles of the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not a place for ordinary carriages to pass through. The carriage in front of him was not adorned without a family crest, and the coachman was ragged and shabby.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It seemed that an ignorant bunch of low-ranking aristocrats had come from some backwater countryside without knowing the restrictions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he had to fulfill his duties as the captain of the guards, so he asked the coachman in a dry voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Sir Graham, captain of the first gate guards. Excuse me, but is it your first time visiting the capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham sniggered inwardly at the expected answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he predicted, it was just a lower-ranking family that didn’t know their place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think you took the wrong road. If you continue that way, you will see the second gate. It happens quite often, but be careful in the future.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After finishing his words, Graham turned around. But then the rough voice of the coachman stopped him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is this not the first gate? I have not come to the wrong place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ha..! This is really…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a sigh, Graham walked back to the carriage with an exasperated expression. Now that he got a closer look, the pale old man had a crummy complexion, and he was even missing an arm.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was unthinkable for a prestigious noble family to have a one-armed old man as a coachman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He felt a little sympathy, but Graham raised his voice. People like these would only understand after being subjected to a little humiliation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just go to the second gate. This is a place that is reserved for distinguished nobles.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those riding in this carriage are well qualified to enter through this gate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the old man’s unrelenting attitude, Graham’s eyebrows squiggled in annoyance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh! Fine. Then let’s hear the identity of your great passengers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Grace Alan Pendragon and his company.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So who is this Alan Pendrag… Heuk!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham froze mid-shrug, and his face hardened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“S, so… Do you mean that the Pendragon Duchy’s heir is currently riding in this carriage?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. Lady Irene Pendragon and Baroness Lindsay Conrad are also accompanying him as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos’ words caused Graham, as well as the surrounding soldiers, to take on shocked expressions and look around in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uh… Well, I, I will need to check…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham couldn’t blindly trust the words of a shabby one-armed man, so he gulped loudly and stuttered.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the carriage door opened at that moment and someone walked out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m Alan Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a young, handsome man who was wearing a silver-white armor. It was clear to anyone at a glance that the armor was a priceless treasure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham was stunned. It was impossible for him, an experienced knight, to not recognize the value of the White Dragon Armor that Raven was wearing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m supposed to stamp it, right? Where is the register?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spoke casually as he strode forward, and Graham hurriedly called one of the soldiers after coming out of his daze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“H, here it is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham put forth a register that was embedded with the symbol of the royal family, the golden lion, and Raven stamped the ring that was on his right, middle finger onto the list.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A clear crest of a dragon was stamped on the silver register.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham’s eyes quivered when he saw the unmistakable crest of the Pendragon Duchy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Graham, am I good to go now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please excuse me, Your Excellency, Duke Pendragon. I hope you can overlook my insolence and carelessness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham took on a militaristic posture of respect.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Alan Pendragon was practically a duke, his title did not change until he met the emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nevertheless, Graham referred to him as a duke. Now that he was in the capital, Alan Pendragon was no different than a real duke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven smirked and lightly pat Graham’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, you were faithful to your duty as the captain of the guards. Actually, it was my fault for riding in such a carriage. Keep up the good work then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes! Thank you, your excellency!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham’s eyes glowed strangely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In normal cases, prestigious nobles would not condone such a situation. Most of them would become infuriated when they felt that they were being berated or ignored even the slightest bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the young monarch of the Pendragon Duchy did not blame him.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a rare sight among the children of the noble family, as they usually tended to be arrogant and short-tempered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘As I’ve heard, he is quite something.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He thought that Alan Pendragon was quite admirable, then cried out after looking back towards the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Open the gates! The Duke of Pendragon and his company are visiting the capital!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dozens of soldiers raised their halberds in a precise movement and parted from side to side together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham signaled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Boom! Boom! Boom! Awooooga!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sounds of the drums and trumpet resounded, pulsating far and wide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is this now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having gotten back in the carriage, Raven frowned slightly at the sudden sound of the trumpet. Leon replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When a direct descendant of the royal family, or a duke of the empire enters, they sound the trumpet. It only rings a few times throughout the entire year.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh… They really go to the extent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene smiled brightly at the sight of Raven, who was stroking his chin dumbfoundedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is the capital, brother. It’s the kind of courtesy you deserve as the master of Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is as the lady says. And about now, quite a few people should be busily running around.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon spoke proudly, but Raven responded with an absent-minded nod.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Leon had spoken the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Send a signal right now! The Wall of Victory! No, send a messenger to the Wall of the Lion right now! An old horseman with one arm! Tell them to let them pass unconditionally!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Two horses had been on the standby as soon as the trumpets resounded, and they madly galloped forward at Graham’s cry. Soon, a white pigeon also flew above the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had to take on a calm attitude as the guard captain of the gate just a little while ago, but the person who had just passed was an important figure. They had been ordered to treat him with the utmost respect, and they were told to be on high alert ever since a month ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could not help but be anxious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dammit… I knew he would arrive soon, but who would have thought he would show up in such a manner?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham looked at the flying messenger pigeon. He wiped the sweat that was covering his forehead and neck even though it was the middle of winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The grand heir of the Roxan family, the Duke of Pendragon… The imperial castle is going to be in an uproar.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham felt reassured.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At least he was finished with everything he was tasked to do.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was then.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From far away, a red wagon pulled by eight horses and a group of knights raising a flag were approaching the gate. Even from afar, it was evident from the large number of people that they were from far from ordinary. Graham let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ha…. who is it now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ca, captainnn!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why? What is it?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham looked up towards the urgent cry of a soldier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s Lindegor! It’s the crest of the Lindegor Duchy!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Gaah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A moan escaped through the thick lips of Graham.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A crest that was embedded with a dark green four-leaf clover, and an angel above it. The angel’s wings were wide-spread, and it was holding two long swords.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Flutter!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only duchy besides the Pendragon family that shared the blood of the royal family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a single family, they were one of the strongest in the empire as they possessed near 10,000 troops. Their crested flag danced in the cold slither of the winter wind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s carriage moved along the well-paved road of the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look over there!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The residents of the capital opened their eyes in surprise as they saw two horses galloping, far ahead of a carriage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get out of the way!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Everyone, show respect!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the passersby quickly moved to the side of the road, took off their hats, and bowed their heads at the cry of the two riders. The two riders hurried their horses, each of them holding a red flag.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is going on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know. Didn’t High Lord Roxan’s family pass by just now as well?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The residents of the capital were well aware that a straight road connected the first gate of the Wall of Glory and the Wall of Victory. Thus, everyone that passed through the road was prestigious nobles of the empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Also, most of the nobles rode in luxurious, lofty carriages, accompanied by a huge number of knights and soldiers, to show off their status.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Therefore, even if messengers were not sent ahead of the nobles, the residents knew to bow their heads and show respect as the nobles passed by.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But today was a little strange.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the second time today that a procession of a grand noble was passing through the road, and this time around, they were even sending messengers ahead of them to announce their arrival.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Which family is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I wonder? Yikes! It looks like they’re going to pass us by.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The residents hastily bowed their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, some residents sneakily stole glances at the carriage that was coming towards them at a moderate speed. Then, their eyes showed confusion and shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a plain little carriage drawn by two horses.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, the coachman was a middle-aged man dressed in old, shabby clothing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The residents started to doubt whether the carriage actually stemmed from the first gate, then, they heard the diminishing shouts of the flag-bearer that rode ahead of the carriage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get out of the way! It’s the procession of His Excellency, Duke Pendragon!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The echoing voice from afar made the residents tremble unknowingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you hear that? It’s Pendragon!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ohhh! The Pendragon family finally arrived at the capital!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where, where!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the residents of the capital frequently witnessed the procession of nobles, they could not hide their anticipation at the arrival of the Pendragon family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, they could not hide their disappointment once they saw a shabby carriage, driven by an old, one-armed man. There were no accompaniments of soldiers or knights, and the carriage was extremely crummy compared to the other nobles’ carriages.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh, what? Is that really true?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are they the real Pendragon?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Perhaps… it’s just a low-class noble that serves under the Pendragon family?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But regardless of how the residents murmured and questioned, the carriage leisurely passed by the streets of the capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Um, shall I go out and crack down on the people, my lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon heard the voices of the capital’s residents and slowly spoke up towards Raven. Raven’s eyes were half-closed, and he answered calmly without budging.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We didn’t come to show off our power. You don’t need to do something unnecessary.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon hastily bowed his head, and Raven sank back into his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Near the time of your arrival, all the important personnel and powerful families from the great territories will gather in the imperial castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then Vincent said all of them would proceed to observe him and judge him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Raven had left for the imperial castle with a large procession, all the High Lords would send him invitations on his way to the capital, which would make it harder for him to make proper judgments.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would take a lot of mental effort and energy to deal with each of the High Lords as they tried to test the waters while hiding their innermost thoughts, and eventually, it would become more difficult for Raven to make cold judgments when he arrived at the imperial castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent’s such predictions came true.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thanks to the subtlety of traveling with a small group, Raven had avoided confrontations with most of the High Lords, and this caused the High Lords and the other nobles to be anxious and distraught instead. Now, Raven held the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Naturally, the incident in Edgel had played a part as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This is the real beginning.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes flashed open.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Far away, he could see a golden wall lined with giant statues of lions, the statues seemingly guarding the wall. The majestic beasts were poised on their hind paws, raising their front claws as if to climb towards the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>
