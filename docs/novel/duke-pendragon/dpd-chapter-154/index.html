 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can discuss the specifics with Ian.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven and Ian left the emperor’s office.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soon, only three people were left in the office – the emperor, Count Jean Granite, and Duke Lindegor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you believe that Duke Pendragon will be able to handle Arangis?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor smiled faintly at the words of Duke Lindegor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For now, I think it’s about 20 percent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindegor narrowed his eyes slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He himself also estimated the possibility of Duke Pendragon being able to handle Arangis around twenty or thirty percent. Furthemore, it also meant that there was only a sliver of a chance. But considering the words that the emperor had spoken to Duke Pendragon, combined with the faint smile he gave, Duke Lindegor was convinced that the emperor had something else on his mind, something that Lindegor was also thinking of.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This foolish man seeks answers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you call yourself foolish, the entire world must be filled with only idiots.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor smiled at the words of Lindegor. He was certainly trying to gauge the emperor’s thoughts. The emperor continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you know, Pendragon will not be able to dispatch their troops to any other territories. For one thing, dispatching troops is an entirely different matter from territorial disputes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Lindegor nodded wordlessly at the words of the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the emperor said, it was a different matter for a large army to wage war on its own territory or on its borders compared to charging into another territory. It would be unfathomably unfavorable as they would not be aware of the foreign land’s geography, and since they wouldn’t know the local situations of the land as well. This would put them at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Above all else, supply was the biggest issue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Arangis Duchy was located away from the imperial mainland, across the local seas on the small and large islands in the south, including Crete Island, the biggest island in the empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would take an enormous amount of money to feed a large army of thousands for more than a few months. It would be a tough endeavor, even for the high lords. Moreover, the southern waters were crawling with pirates and orcs who would be allied with the Arangis Duchy. It would be a battle in itself to get supplies across the waters to the troops.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was one of the crucial reasons why the emperor himself couldn’t hastily move the imperial army.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, it was written as 20 percent, but read as nearly impossible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But still, the emperor voiced his opinion as twenty percent and never called it impossible. Duke Lindegor was convinced that the emperor had hope because he was thinking along the same lines as himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are planning to give ‘that place’ to Duke Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there any other way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. I would have probably come to the same conclusion. But as you know, Your Majesty, foolish and greedy people may be dissatisfied with the decision.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the difference? It shouldn’t matter anyway, since it will only be a temporary measure. Shouldn’t three years be enough?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Pendragon is young and wise. In three years, he might devour it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Maybe. But I cannot compare that one place with my entire empire.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Duke Lindegor attempted to speak, but then closed his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if seeing through Duke Lindegor’s heart, the emperor smiled and responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know what you are worried about. However, I don’t think the young, wise dragon has thought that far yet. Moreover…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor blurred the ends of his words and turned his head towards the windows, where he stared out into the deep night with a hazy expression. He continued his words as he silently observed the night skies of the capital, where all kinds of greedy people resided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The young dragon seems to chase a different purpose. It isn't the kind of ambition you are worried about.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Lindegor did not affirm nor deny the emperor’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He did not trust humans.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps it was due to the influence of Angel Seiel, who had been with his family for generations. However, the emperor had seen far more schemes and plots as he reigned over the huge empire. If the emperor said so, then his own judgment was not important.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He only hoped that the young dragon would not harbor such ambitions after he grew stronger and more experienced.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could only hope.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor soon smiled after a moment of silence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Above all else, Ian is by the side of Pendragon. He is my son, but he’s quite extraordinary. Ian will stop him if Pendragon gets any other ideas.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Lindegor thought inwardly that even the second prince wouldn’t be able to easily handle the dragon once it grew up, but he repressed his thoughts and smiled along with the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyhow, the young dragon and Ian should be having a chat similar to our own conversation, wouldn’t you say? If you and I gauged him correctly, that is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think so as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Lindegor sincerely hoped so.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I only hope that his ambition only stretches to the place you mentioned…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, his hope had a slightly different meaning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? You want to distribute the gold coins of the Pendragon Duchy throughout the empire? Furthermore, the gold content is 70 percent of imperial gold, but you want to maintain a distribution cost of 80 percent?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian displayed shock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk, aren’t you just saying you want to take everything for free?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The empire did not use foreign gold coins that contained less gold than imperial gold. In addition, usage of unrecognized currency within the empire always resulted in execution without trial.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not technically free. His Majesty told me to confront Arangis. Money? Troops? Do you think the Pendragon Duchy has anything that is comparable to Arangis?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian had no words to retort, so he could only frown.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Certainly, it seemed impossible for the Pendragons to stand against the Arangis Duchy, let alone two or three lords under its command. In the end, the Pendragon Duchy needed to grow several times stronger for them to be able to keep the Arangis Duchy in check and to finally hold them accountable for their treasonous sin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Above all else, money was the most important factor in order for the Pendragon Duchy to grow rapidly in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It won’t even be for that long. I’ll distribute it only for a year. Our raccoon estimates that only about 20 percent of the empire’s annual budget will be spent. It won’t even hurt the empire’s economy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dammit! It’s that bastard again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian shouted in vulgar language unbefitting of his status. He emptied his teacup at once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fine. I don’t have the authority to make such a decision anyways. His Majesty will take care of it. Tsk, I was planning to throw you a fish, pretend to give in and be shocked, but this, this will be a total loss…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven feigned ignorance and asked in jest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why? What were you planning on giving me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk, pretending not to know. His Majesty wouldn’t have just left Arangis to you without thinking about it first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, are you really going to act stupid?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sorry, if it wasn’t for this kind of occasion, when would I ever get to make fun of a prince?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If anyone else had spoken those words, Ian would have thrown his fist without hesitation, but he calmed his anger after shooting a fierce gaze at Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Leus, you take care of it starting next year.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the sight of Raven nodding his head without hesitation, Ian could only sigh, let alone get angry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk.. did you really think that far?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t it obvious? The Governor of Leus committed treason and suicide, so wouldn’t someone else have to take over? In this sort of situation, I’m the only one who’s qualified.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph, don’t glee over it too much. Even so, it will…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Only be temporary. I’m guessing… about three years?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian couldn’t help but shut his mouth. Strangely, this spiteful brat seemed to be getting a blow on him quite often lately.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To think he had even guesses on the duration.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t make such a face. I’ll do my best to clean up. From cracking down on the local lords to the extermination of the pirates, I will finish it all within a year. Isn’t that what you want?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian was visibly shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had already experienced Duke Pendragon’s wit countless times. But being smart and anticipating the flow of the big picture was a different matter. Moreover, Duke Pendragon wasn’t even 20 yet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Other nobles of the same age would have turned barely old enough to become knights, and they would be too busy showing themselves off. What would happen if such brats were to become the Governor of Leus?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, it would never happen, but in case it did, they were sure to fall into all sorts of delusions and arrogance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What the fuck is this guy? He predicted that Father would give him Leus, as well as what Father wanted him to do with the city? Did that raccoon named Vincent Ron teach him this as well?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian’s eyes sank coldly as he observed Raven.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was confident that he wouldn’t lose to anyone if it was a battle of wits. But the one in front of him was different.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had already known the brat to be on par with himself. But for the first time, Ian thought that Raven could be smarter than he was. Rather, he was so smart that Ian could hardly predict what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t look at me like that. As I already told His Majesty, Pendragon will keep their loyalty to the royal family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Those words, you’ll have to keep them forever.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven and Ian’s gazes met in midair.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if foreshadowing the future of the two men, the feelings contained in the eyes of the two were neither goodwill nor hostility.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just like the first time they met, their gazes belonged to two young beasts who controlled their own mountain as they explored and probed each other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Perhaps Duke Lindegor is already aware and keeping him in check for this reason.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It hurt his pride a little, but that seemed to be the case. Lasse Lindegor must have identified the true nature of the young man even though he had known him for a shorter period of time compared to Ian.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…By the way, it will become pretty noisy if the Pendragon currency starts circulating and I get Leus as well, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The tense atmosphere only lasted a short while, and Ian broke the silence while raising the tip of his lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven smiled along and shrugged.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The chess pieces are set in place anyways, wouldn’t you rather a noisy round? I am going to do exactly what you and His Majesty want. I’m going to make this a very exciting game.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good, good. Is there anything else you want?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian asked without much thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrary to Ian’s expectations, however, Raven’s expression turned serious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is one thing…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spoke in a heavily subdued voice. Ian was quite startled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I want to ask you a favor. Don’t ask me for the reason.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian was quite surprised by Raven’s attitude. It was the first time he had acted in such a way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it? Tell me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven sank into silence for a moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ‘request’ he was about to make was not as Duke Pendragon but as Raven Valt.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had no choice but to be cautious.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he inwardly shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Vincent had mentioned, Ian would frantically try to keep himself in check from now on, unlike how it had been until now. However, if he made an extremely personal request at this point, Ian’s vigilance would ease a little.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People like Ian were more vulnerable to personal feelings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eventually, Raven slowly opened his lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you know about the demonic army?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The demonic army? Of course I know. It’s a unit composed of all kinds of trash and filth. I’m ashamed to even call them a part of the imperial army.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt a little bitter that he himself was once part of the ‘trash and filth’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you know where they are currently?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Raven already knew where they were and what they were doing, he wanted to make sure his actions had not altered the flow of events.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think they are in the south. It seems that a monster is making a ruckus playing king.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was referring to the Troll King. It was a relief. History had not been altered drastically.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But why are you mentioning the demonic army all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian’s question reminded Raven of a certain someone.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baltai, the worst of the worst. The scumbag wore a helmet of ogre skull and pushed the trash of the demonic army.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spoke with an intense, murderous gaze. It was a gaze that had not appeared for quite some time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I want control of it.”</span></p>
