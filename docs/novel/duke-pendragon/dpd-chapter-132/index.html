 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, that is why we do not need to recruit any more troops to prepare for a war. We can continue to train the vigilantes of the villages on a regular basis, appoint the veteran soldiers as squires, and bequeath them land and wealth.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I understand. Anyhow, we should deal with the figures I saw at the port today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For the time being, I’m planning to observe them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent shook his head with a stiff expression at the mention of the wizards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is no need to scare the snake by going through the grass. If you care to know who released the snakes, it’s better to let them wander about for a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Recently, there had been an increase in the number of foreign knights and mercenaries coming into Pendragon territory.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And today, even a wizard showed up.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Quite a few spies were bound to be mixed up in the batch. Furthermore, there must have been at least twice as many people who sneaked in secretly compared to those who walked in openly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the last 15 days, more and more people had been coming into the territory to get a grasp of the duchy’s situation. It was most likely due to the recent incident in the territory of Alice involving Alan Pendragon, the lord of the duchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the incident in Alice was reported back, the Pendragon duchy went into a great uproar. It was to the point that Count Seyrod and Count Bressia of Sisak sent secret messengers to discuss possible measures that could be taken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, even Vincent wondered why his lord had caused such a huge incident, but he understood after hearing the whole story.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The division was about to begin anyways. No one knows who their allies are, and who their enemies are. If the division was made clear from the incident that the lord caused this time, I have to use the information to pick out the enemies accurately and lead the situation.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The aftermath of the Alice crisis had yet to subside, and the process and the results were not entirely without regrets.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not entirely clear whether the incident would ultimately benefit or harm the Pendragon Duchy, but the most important thing was that Alan Pendragon had concluded the event while holding onto both the justification and the heart of the people.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now, it was Vincent’s job to create something tangible out of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘First of all, I should observe the responses of the thirteen High Lords and the major players in imperial politics. I need to figure out who, and why they have been sending spies into our territory… like those in the port today.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those who showed up in the port will head to York Town in a few days. I will take care of them, so you don’t have to worry about it, Sir Isla.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I trust Sir Ron.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that the lord and Soldrake were not present in the duchy, Isla knew that the most reliable person was Vincent Ron. Isla nodded lightly and stood up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, by the way…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla started to walk towards the door, then suddenly turned his head. Vincent became a little curious when Isla, who usually spoke the bare minimum with an indifferent attitude, seemed to hesitate for some reason.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have been wondering… Does Sir Ron know where Lord Soldrake has gone?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent answered with a rather regretful expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do not know either. But… I know that both the lord and Lord Soldrake only leave the duchy when they have to take care of issues that are of paramount importance to our duchy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla nodded once more, then left through the door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After Isla left, Vincent let out a short sigh and looked out the window.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><em>‘I wonder what is going on. Why did Lord Soldrake head to that place…?’</em></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In reality, Vincent knew where Soldrake had set off to. Before the lord left for the imperial castle, he had told Vincent, and only Vincent, where Soldrake was going.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, even Vincent, the genius who had recently gained the nickname “Raccoon Mask”, was clueless as to why Soldrake had chosen to leave for that place at this moment, and what it had to do with his lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Robstein Plains…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A remote wasteland located to the far northeast alpines.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vincent did not know that the barren land which was around 2,000 miles away from the Pendragon Duchy was the place where Raven Valt and Alan Pendragon perished together.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A vast land that spread across the horizon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was early winter. The land was barren and devoid of any life, and the sun’s rays draped across the horizon, coloring the scenery crimson.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Something flew across the vast sky against the backdrop of dusk. It reflected the light just like a blossoming red flower in a desolate, brown land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The identity of the being was White Dragon Soldrake, her silver-white body dyed in the glow of a setting sun.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake circled around the sky several times in the icy wind, then headed towards an endless canyon that was scarred into the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The deep, wide valley was over 3,000 feet wide and over 1,000 feet deep. It made even an almighty dragon seem like a small bird in comparison. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake flew through the magnificent scenery created in harmony by mother nature and the Earth God, and soon folded her wings after arriving at her destination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Woosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In an instant, Soldrake took on the form of a female knight, then looked around her surroundings with an indifferent expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The creatures of the valley felt the presence of the dragon and quickly went into hiding, daring not to take even a single breath for fear of catching her attention.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake climbed the valley ridges with light steps, as if she were on an easy stroll. She stopped, and her eyes glimmered for an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[To think that there would truly be a vein in this place, Ray’s words were true.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A dragon vein.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a type of mana repository that only dragons could access. It was a place so special and rare that Soldrake knew of only around ten such places across the land.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The veins contained vast, ancient mana, but it was so rough and powerful that even the mightiest of sorcerers could not fully reap the mana of the dragon veins. If something went wrong, there was a high chance of having one’s own mana absorbed into the vein.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Therefore, most of the dragon veins in existence were used by dragons as their homes, as their lairs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mount Ancona, where the mausoleum of the Pendragon family was located, also contained a dragon vein.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Wooooooosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake opened her senses and felt the raging torrents of wild mana surging through the valley. Hundreds of translucent threads of spirits spread out from her body and stretched out all over the body.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The vein wasn’t as powerful as the one in her own lair, but a dragon vein of this strength was bound to have an owner, whether it be a monster, a beast, or a dragon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was looking for that very existence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was then. From the other side of the valley, something black flew towards her at a high speed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a black dragon with three obsidian horns protruding from its head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The black dragon slowly sank to the ground, while carefully looking down at Soldrake with its vast wings spread open.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The black dragon folded its wings. Black and red lights glimmered around the black dragon’s body and the dragon disappeared. In its place was a young man dressed in black leather and equipped with two small swords at his sides.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Queen of all brothers.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man had glimmering eyes that were like black sapphire. He pulled one foot back and bowed towards Soldrake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Amuhalt.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake gave a slight nod in response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Amuhalt was one of the six dragons that had come uninvited after Raven succeeded in recapturing the mausoleum and making a contract with Soldrake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He waved his hand in the air, and a swarm of light appeared in thin air. Soon, two thrones shaped like dragons, one silvery-white, and the other black, appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Please, have a seat.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Soldrake silently gazed at Amuhalt without moving.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a moment, Soldrake slowly sat down on the silvery-white throne.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Did you know about the existence of this vein, Amulhalt? Your territory is located in the Kashibal Volcanoes. It is against the ancient oaths for a brother to possess more than one territory.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I knew of the existence, but this is not my territory, Queen. I just happened to come across it a few years ago, but I never told you about it.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Explain yourself.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I did not want to cause trouble for the Queen, who had been heartbroken by the failure of the pact between her and the human.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake was listening to Amuhalt’s story with an indifferent expression until that point, but a strong glow appeared in her eyes at his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Do you dare to criticize me?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Woosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A burst of silver-white light burst out from Soldrake’s eyes, and the dimming shadows of the valley were momentarily overwhelmed by the luminescence.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the Black Dragon Amulaht did not budge from his seat and spoke from the throne in the same posture as before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Calm your anger, Queen. I, Amuhalt, only wanted to discuss the matter with all the brothers when the Queen could make a proper judgment.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I always lead my brothers as the Queen. My competency is not a matter for you to judge, Amuhalt.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I apologize. But, Queen, I would also like to ask you a question. For what reason has the Queen come to this place?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[It is none of your business.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[No, I need to know. It has been two years since I discovered this place. Since then, the mana here has gone berserk twice. This spring, and the day Queen renewed the covenant with the Pendragon human. And to my surprise, the Pendragon human whom the queen made a pact with, possesses the spirit of the Dragon God and spirit of the Demon God.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[……]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first incident was probably the day when Raven was reborn as Alan Pendragon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was significant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[An impossible thing has happened. Someone who failed in making a pact before succeeded in their second attempt. And a new vein of mana happened to go berserk on the day that the Pendragon human and the Queen made a pact. And today, Queen is here, a place that is only known to myself. How can this be explained?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake remained silent. She could not tell the truth of the matter – That Raven originally died in this place along with Alan Pendragon, and that Raven was reincarnated in the body of Alan Pendragon after going against the flow of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most importantly, she could not tell him that she had also perished alongside Alan Pendragon in this place. According to Raven’s story, it seemed she ended her own life in order to complete a certain form of magic.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if she had intended to send Alan Pendragon back in time to be reborn.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The magic of turning back time.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For such a massive spell to be possible, there would be special conditions that needed to be met, as well as huge amounts of mana.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For example, a new dragon vein, unknown to any other dragons, that contained a large untapped reservoir of mana, and the life of the dragon’s leader.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Soldrake did not know of such a spell right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It meant that someone had taught her the spell for some reason, and she had carried out the spell, even if the cost was her life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I cannot answer right now, Amuhalt.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though she still spoke in a monotone voice, Amuhalt could see that Soldrake was in a deep contemplation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Since you say so, I will not ask anymore. But Queen, you know that the energies of the Dragon God and the Demon God are a powerful force that cannot be handled even with all of our brothers’ strengths combined. Our brothers are carefully observing every one of the Pendragon human’s movements.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Amulaht’s flaming eyes turned to the darkened sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[As the Queen is aware of, the power of the Dragon God can awake the brothers who have lost their powers. In addition, the power of the Demon God can blur the boundary between death and life. It can grant the dead life, which could shake the very foundations of this world.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I will take responsibility for those matters. The Black Sage may head back now.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Amuhalt turned his head when he heard the title “Black Sage”.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sudden gust of wind caused his long, silky black hair to flutter in the wind, and his face was revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a slight smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Black Sage… I guess you still have deep affection for your brother that you would call me by that title. All right, I respect the Queen’s decision. Then, Dragon Queen, the head of all our brothers, please take care.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Amuhalt bowed politely and his body enveloped in a dark red light.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He took on his draconic form and shot off towards the other side of the valley with a long roar. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake stared at the direction that Amuhalt had flown towards for a while before turning her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I miss Ray.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her eyes shone like a thousand stars and it pierced all the way to the imperial castle, where the king of the humans lay, through thousands of miles of distance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Eugh….Heuk! Guahh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A dying groan could be heard over and over.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the one-armed old man with a slim face remained silent on the coachman’s seat without a change in his expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And by his side – by the carriage’s side, to be exact, a young man was running.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keuhg… Heuk! Heueuk!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone that they passed looked at the panting young man with absurd expressions, but the carriage and the young man quickly disappeared from their view.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ueh…. Ueh, Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crack!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A whip drew a graceful curve and hit the back of the heaving young man’s head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Gah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It will be harder if you lose your breath. Stamina and breath control are the backbone of the art of fighting. Always keep that in mind even when you are running.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon wasn’t able to respond due to the lack of air, but he quickly calmed his breathing and righted himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wrapped around his waist was a sturdy rope connected to the carriage.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he fell down, he would be dragged along by the carriage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The carriage continued along the imperial road, and it arrived at a town after passing through a lonely forest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heuaaaahhhh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as the carriage stopped, Leon flopped down beside the horse.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though the weather was quite chilly, his whole body was completely drenched with sweat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, allow me, Your Grace. Ladies.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, Argos.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene got off first, followed by Lindsay.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay’s eyes filled with regret as she exited the carriage. It was because she saw the hollow sleeve of Argos, which was fluttering in the wind.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Lindsay shook her head slightly and took Argos’ hand without saying anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though he was old and now without an arm, Argos was still a strong man. After his arm was severed, Argos managed to get back up before four days passed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how much the secret art of the Tiramis Temple reduced pain, it would be hard for ordinary people to overcome such unimaginable pain. It was evident that Argos was a powerful, vigorous figure.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And one should not recklessly sympathize with such a person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good work, Argos. I could have driven the carriage…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike the two girls, Raven spoke with a slightly sorry look as he got off the carriage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos shook his head vigorously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is what this old man wanted to do. Please don’t mind it, Your Grace.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you say so… Anyways, how is he doing? His stamina seems to have improved quite a bit, don’t you think it’s time to teach him something tangible?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven smiled at the sight of Leon trying to stand up as he saw Raven exit, despite his poor condition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was no wonder. Leon had been running beside the carriage without rest for the past fifteen days, and since four days ago, he had sandbags attached to his arms and legs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was all on the orders of Argos, his master.</span></p>
