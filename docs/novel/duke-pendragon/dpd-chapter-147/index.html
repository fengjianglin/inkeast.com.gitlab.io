 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well then, I will go take a look.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take care of yourself. He looks like he’s from the countryside, so make sure you tell him that you’ll keep the sword safely stowed away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Alion spoke with a sigh, and Graham grinned before coming down from the balcony.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham walked through the guards who were watching the man with nervous eyes and soon arrived in front of the strange man. The strange man was gulping loudly while staring at a woman’s buttocks in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Graham suddenly initiated a conversation with him, the man turned his head in surprise, then smiled awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Um, are you talking to me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. Are you here to attend the grand banquet?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Grand banquet? Oh, there was a banquet in the castle today? Ah, no wonder there are so many beautiful ladies…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the man stroked his chin with a surprised expression, Graham was finally convinced. It was clear that the strange man was a hillbilly who came to the capital to sightsee. He must have been wandering around and unknowingly ended up in front of the imperial castle’s gates.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I apologize, but today is the day of the grand banquet that is personally hosted by the emperor himself. No one without an invitation is allowed in, so I think it might be better for you to turn back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Originally, access was not normally granted anyways unless one had a valid reason or was from a prestigious noble family on the level of the high lords. Nevertheless, Graham did not treat him recklessly because the eyes of the nobles around them were heading towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a knight of the imperial castle’s gate, Graham was very proud and responsible. He wanted to show politeness and respect regardless of who he was dealing with.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, that’s a bit problematic. I have come to the imperial castle to see someone.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham sighed gently at the words of the confused man. The knights from the countryside always had the same repertoire, it was always too obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ten times out of ten, they were here to meet the emperor, to become a faithful sword of the empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Majesty is a busy man, and there are many outstanding knights by his side. If you give me your name and your family, I can put you on the list wand…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? What are you talking about? I am not here to see the emperor.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham became a little annoyed as the strange man cut off his words. Even though he had tried to explain as calmly as possible and was showing the man respect, the strange man had ignored his consideration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew…! Then who are you here to meet?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Excellency Duke Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heuk!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham became startled and let out a gasp at hearing the unexpected name.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ohhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A burst of exclamations could be heard from all over the place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Pendragon, a man of high reputation who recently stirred up the entire empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Furthermore, all of the people who were here to attend the banquet were already aware of the events that had transpired at the White Palace earlier today. Apparently, the emperor had finally shown himself and conversed with Duke Pendragon, going as far as to show favor to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, the empress had personally invited Duke Pendragon to the Golden Rose Palace, one of the most secretive residences in the castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The name of Pendragon changed the expressions of the nobles that were observing the situation. At first, they were enjoying the situation as if they were waiting to see a comedy play out, then they took on astonished expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, my apologies, but your name is…?”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham asked cautiously just in case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man proudly raised up his head and laughed boisterously before replying loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mark Killian. I am the head knight of the Pendragon Duchy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only five members from the Pendragon family were said to have entered the palace, including Duke Pendragon. Among the other four, except for Duke Pendragon’s sister and his concubine, the other two were a shabby one-armed horseman and an imperial clown.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Compared to the other noble families that brought dozens of knights and soldiers, it was an incredibly shabby entourage for a prestigious duchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, it was natural for the nobles to show curiosity when the country bumpkin in front of them claimed to be a knight of the Pendragon family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Forgive me for my rudeness, Sir Killian. However, as you probably know, you must prove your identity. Moreover, I have not received any words from His Excellency Pendragon regarding your arrival.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haha! Of course, I understand. Here it is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Killian laughed heartily at Graham’s polite words, then pulled out his identification token. The rectangular plate decorated with silver was stamped with the seal of the Pendragon Duchy. It was authentic, no doubt about it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Confirmed. Over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Graham called a royal guard and whispered in his ear. The guard nodded quickly, then entered through the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For now, I have informed Duke Pendragon that you have arrived. We will take you inside. Let us go in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sounds good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The news regarding Mark Killian’s arrival quickly spread through the imperial castle. At a time when almost all the nobles were scrutinizing every move of Duke Pendragon, the arrival of his knight aroused great curiosity among many people.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, not everyone was happy to hear the news.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Excellency. A man who calls himself the head knight of the Pendragon Duchy has just entered the palace. His name is Mark Killian.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By any chance, was he alone? He did not bring anyone with him?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, he was alone. I have already received confirmation from the guards at the Wall of Glory. I am certain.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda murmured after sitting back down in his chair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The head knight of the duchy came all the way to the capital by himself, and is now entering the palace? This is suspicious…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, the noble spoke cautiously once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Excellency, I heard that Mark Killian has served the Pendragon Duchy for the longest time and is their most loyal knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Duke Pendragon left for the imperial castle without saying a word, and Lady Irene ran away from home without permission, right? They might have sent one of the knights to quietly bring her back to the castle without causing a commotion.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, it certainly could be. Even so, it’s still a little suspicious.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda nodded, his face still full of suspicion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Excellency, we have received a report from the crows.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A knight rushed in and reported.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda’s eyes glimmered. The mercenaries he hired to spy on the Pendragon Duchy had reported back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The knight named Mark Killian left the duchy, but he was alone. Moreover, there has not been any movements from Conrad Castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ho! That is a relief.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Sagunda finally showed relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the knight named Mark Killian had brought along Ruv Tylen to testify in front of the emperor about the attempted assassination of Crown Prince Shio, it was highly likely that the situation would turn for the worst. However, neither Duke Pendragon nor Mark Killian brought along Ruv Tylen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hoo-hoo. It seems you still have a brain. If you rush out your trump card, it could disappear in an instant…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A sly smile caught the ears of Count Sagunda.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Ruv Tylen died, everything was over.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the only person capable of providing evidence to Duke Pendragon and Prince Ian’s testimonies died, then all their attempts would become dust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Therefore, mercenaries and assassins were deployed around the neck of every road leading in and out of the Pendragon Duchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how heavily guarded he would be, Ruv Tylen would die the moment he left the duchy. In the end, it was clear that Duke Pendragon had chosen not to bring Ruv Tylen because he knew of this as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But that will be your biggest, most painful mistake, little dragon…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The eyes of Count Sagunda glowed as he prepared himself to push Duke Pendragon over the edge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“M, my lord! Congratulations! You have finally become the true master of Pendragon!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as Raven entered with Ian, Killian went down on one knee, unable to restrain his passion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Everyone, you may leave.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the others left the room at the words of Ian.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well then. What is going on? What about Ruv Tylen?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian hurriedly asked. Ian had expected Ruv Tylen to have come as well when he heard that someone had come to the imperial castle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the contrary, Raven had already guessed something as soon as he heard about Killian’s arrival at the imperial castle. He spoke calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Enough with the greetings. Sir Killian, did Sir Ron send you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, yes. That’s right! First, this…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Killian hurriedly searched his bosom and took something out.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a well-sealed letter that was rolled up. Raven silently read the letter, then spoke to Ian, who was looking at him with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is the likelihood that Sagunda will make a move today at the grand banquet?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is very high. I heard that he’s been all over the place, trying to meet as many people as possible. Moreover, rumors have already spread that your knight was alone when he arrived. This will be the best opportunity for Sagunda.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian frowned anxiously.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">According to the plan, someone was supposed to have brought in Ruv Tylen.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then could he be used as a witness to publicize the relation between the assassination attempt on Crown Prince Shio and the rebellion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Killian had come alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All the officials will be there, as well as His Majesty. Ruv Tylen, the only witness, will not be there, so he knows you will not be able to bring up the matter regarding Shio. He will consider it the best opportunity to bring up what you did in Edgel and take the initiative.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. Well, that’s great.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded lightly and stood up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Great? What do you mean?”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ian frowned in confusion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven did not answer immediately. He walked to the window and looked up at the night sky before asking a question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The raccoon from my family that we took in a while ago. Do you remember?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raccoon? Are you talking about the knight named Vincent Ron?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven changed the topic suddenly and brought up Vincent out of the blue, but Ian recalled that Vincent had dispatched Killian here. He sensed there was something more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. I guess it’s true that geniuses can see a thousand miles away while sitting.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spoke in a quiet voice, and he had a subtle smile at the edge of his lips. Only the white, cold full moon could be seen reflecting off of his tranquil eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Golden Lion Hall. A huge space that was about 100 yards wide and 170 yards long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The heroes of the past centuries decorated the high ceiling, and the dozens of elegant, golden chandeliers brightened the hall like the day. Along with the White Palace, the Golden Lion Hall was considered one of the most spectacular locations in the imperial castle. The hall, which displayed its brilliant splendor, was filled with male and female nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hundreds of nobles stood in groups of twos and threes. They chatted while the imperial orchestra, consisting of about 30 members dressed in red and white robes, played elegant melodies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The higher-ranking nobles, including those belonging to the families of high lords, sat in tables that were placed on the balconies to the left and right sides of the hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, regardless of whether they were sitting or standing, all of the nobles present at the grand banquet shared similar interests.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Excellency Duke Lindegor has not arrived yet, has he?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A woman in her early 30s looked around the hall. A young noble, who was dressed in an old fashion, answered with an arrogant smirk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haha, since it is Viscountess Tyrone’s first time at the grand banquet, you might not know. They will enter just before His Majesty the Emperor enters.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Then His Excellency Duke Pendragon will be entering around the same time?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the words of one lady, the other ladies turned their heads around with glittering eyes full of anticipation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I guess so.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young nobleman realized all the attention had moved away from him and licked his lips in vain. However, he did not feel any jealousy. He could not compare himself to Duke Pendragon, who possessed a much higher status and considerable reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had also asked his cousin for a spot at the banquet in order to try to make himself known to Duke Pendragon as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that time, the elegantly flowing melody gradually quieted down, then started up again in a grand tune. It was a song that spoke of the stories of the founding of the empire by the first Emperor Aragon. Everyone stopped what they were doing and turned around as the “Legend of the Golden Lion” resounded throughout the hall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Excellency, Duke Lindegor!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The men took off their hands and the women grabbed the hem of their dresses as they bowed. With the music in full swing, Duke Lindegor entered with his following of knights. The knights were dressed in red dress coats and adorned with purple robes embroidered with the crest of the Lindegor family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Duke Lindegor sat down on his designated seat, a voice resounded once more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Excellency, Duke Pendragon!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In an instant, hundreds of pairs of eyes gathered in one place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oohhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrasting with Duke Linegor’s appearance, low exclamations flowed from all over the place. The young duke, the protagonist of the various rumors, had finally shown himself in front of the numerous nobles that were gathered in the heart of the empire.</span></p>
