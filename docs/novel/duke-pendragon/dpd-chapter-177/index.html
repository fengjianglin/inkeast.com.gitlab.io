 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As always, Raven went outside at dawn to train.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The winter air was cold.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Raven felt more confident than ever and headed to the weapons arsenal that was set up on the side of the back garden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, someone appeared through the gentle early morning fog. Raven identified the figure from the sound of the person’s exact, measured footsteps, so he smirked and threw a practice spear towards the figure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are a little late.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord. I headed to the harbor for a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla saluted towards Raven after receiving the spear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, congratulations, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven showed confusion at the sudden remark.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla continued with a very rare smile that was almost never seen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have accomplished the task with Baroness Conrad with a strong, steel will.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The unexpected remark caused Raven to let out a sharp cough. His face started turning red without realizing it, and he replied with an awkward expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keheum! What are you talking about? What kind of…. steel will… would I…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Everyone in the residence is aware.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Really?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, even our friends from Ancona know about it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To think even Karuta and Kratul were aware…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven closed his mouth and held back a barrage of abusive language that threatened to come out. But Isla’s following words were even more spectacular.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Last night, the voices of Baroness Conrad and the lord resounded throughout the entire residence. They contained such a hot and passionate love… Of course, I, Elkin Isla, as your faithful servant, could not hold back my heartfelt admiration for the supreme power of the lord, truly a knight among knights, the truest of man…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“T, that’s enough! All right, that’s enough!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven raised his voice in horror.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He found Isla letting out embarrassing remarks quite often these days. He truly lived up to his reputation as a Cavalier of Valvas. Valvas was well-known as the land of passion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But my lord, you should have done it at least three times for the Pendragon Duchy’s descendants…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I, I will take care of it, so you can stop now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, I went a little too far. Please forgive me. I did not intend to interfere or raise doubts about your power as a man…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay, okay. I understand, so please stop talking about the matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven raised his voice with a red face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I will follow your orders.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla finally shut his mouth and lowered his head. But when Raven looked down at the knight, he could see a faint smile hanging around his mouth. Raven clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He is doing that on purpose. I’m sure…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven would lose all sense of dignity if they remained on this topic. Raven forced a smile and changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyways, how is Killian? I heard that he took care of some issues along with the heavy cavalry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. He resolved the issues perfectly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. In your opinion, what is the level of our heavy cavalry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of all the knights in the Pendragon Duchy, Isla had the most experiences in the battlefield besides himself, so Raven trusted his judgement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They were great.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hoo…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven was quite surprised by Isla’s words. He rarely complimented.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But as you know, Pendragon Duchy has a lot of flat terrain. But once outside of the territory, the roads are narrow and there are many mountains. Thus, they will be quite effective within the duchy, but once they cross the territorial divide and venture outside, there will be difficulties in battle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla’s judgement was accurate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The heavy cavalry displayed devastating power on flat terrain, but the general infantry were better at sieging or mountaineering.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Definitely so. That is why the griffon unit and you, Sir Isla, are the duchy’s most versatile and powerful force.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s words were not meant to be flattering. Rather, he truly believed that the griffon unit was the most important force in the Pendragon Duchy. Vincent agreed as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If griffons and their riders poured down attacks from an altitude of 700, 800 feet and higher, any type of forces would become powerless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even the most destructive and the farthest-reaching bows shot by humans could not reach such heights, but gravity magnified its power by multiple times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Furthermore, griffon riders were not limited to attacking with crossbows.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wild griffons were much bigger and heavier than horses. Watching such creatures descend from the sky at breakneck speeds would be enough to cause any humans to panic. But what if hundreds of well-trained combat griffons fell toward the heads of enemy forces?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ordinary soldiers with little experience in the field would not be able to hold their ground and lose all courage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, in the past, even the demonic army, which consisted of murderers with abundant combat experience, were sent into a mass panic when they faced just two dive assaults from griffons. Almost 20% of their forces had been destroyed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most of all, griffons had strong talons and wings. It was often the case that wild griffons attacked farmhouses before easily snatching up large bulls or pigs. If they were to drop ‘something’ from high in the sky, the effect would be beyond imagination.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Raven had brought the griffons from the duchy in secret for these very reasons. In the naval battle, which would take place in a few months, the griffons of the Pendragon Duchy would write a new legend along with the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is the status of the griffons?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Very good. Even though they are locked up in cages, they are very well-behaved thanks to the power of Soldrake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded satisfactorily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The griffons of the Pendragon Duchy were unlike other griffons. As subordinate creatures of Soldrake, they did not require taming, and they ate less compared to the other griffons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Naturally, additional training was required for the griffons to perform high-dimensional maneuvers and skills, such as forming a squadron, but such sophistry was not needed for the upcoming operation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All they needed to do was to drop ‘something’ from high places, and that was the reason only the biggest and the strongest creatures were chosen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What about the eyes of the rats?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since the sailboats carrying gold coins were scheduled to arrive in Leus from York Town, it was obvious that they would be watching the port day and night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven had intentionally leaked information to achieve such a situation as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There were two of them. They seemed to recognize me. But they seemed a little curious, perhaps because the ship they’ve been watching out for hasn’t arrived yet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s rather good. They must be getting restless, watching you go in and out of the harbor from dawn.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla was the most famous knight from the duchy except Raven. He was well-known throughout the empire as the right-hand man of the Pendragon Duchy, and he had slaughtered an orc that Toleo Arangis had brought along.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would be obvious to anyone watching that Isla was up to something when he came to the port every dawn, especially when he was receiving news and appeared to be anxiously waiting for something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be at the port once a day before the sailboat arrives. Well, I trust you will do well on your own without me meddling. Be very careful… just enough for the rats to notice.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since you mention it, I shot my spirit towards them when they appeared to be watching me blatantly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That’s how things were.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If you brushed the grass too hard, you might scare the snake away. But if you didn’t touch the grass at all, you would not be able to tell where the snake was. However, when the grass was properly grazed, you could herd the snake towards where you wanted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, it would be deceived into mistaking the event as an opportunity, and attempt to strike with its venomous fangs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We will deliver the decisive blow at the gathering parliament today. If we announce that we will be releasing our gold coins in earnest for the parliament’s regional maintenance…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It will be as good as throwing cheese in front of the rats.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Exactly. As the Governor of Leus and the Duke of Pendragon, it could be called catching two birds with one stone.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven smiled coldly while reciting the old saying. He met Isla’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord. But before that, as the head of the Pendragon Duchy, the hot, steel will that keeps the family afloat, you should…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Elkin…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s smile froze and spirit started to slowly crawl up his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I, Elkin Isla, will start the training.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla struck his chest in a salute and immediately turned around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The flames are too weak! Hey you! Are you trying to feed a family of mice? Why is the portion so small? Oh my god! Marie! Orcs can chew through bones, so you don’t need to debone to fish so carefully.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Normally, Marilyn was as affectionate and relaxed as her generous impression, but she had become more vocal as of late. Despite her urgent scolding, the tens of women dared not retort and busily prepared the meals while sweating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“More spices!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have to make more sauces as well!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The kitchen of the governor’s residence was as busy as a battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shortage of workers became more apparent as the number of officials increased, and even wives and daughters of existing employees pitched in to help.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ancona Orcs played a huge role as well. Thirty orcs could devour enough food to feed a hundred human soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Gosh, all this for just one meal…? How much are we spending on this?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn shook her head as she stared at the mountain of food and ingredients. She had taken on the role of the head chef in the residence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A woman standing next to her replied while trimming vegetables and wiping her sweaty forehead with a towel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew! But it costs a lot less compared to before. And I feel at ease because the governor is not fussy about what he eats. Everyone he brought along too!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is true. With the previous governor, I felt like I was walking on thin ice every day.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t even mention it. All the noble women who were present were also extremely picky. Heave-ho!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A woman chimed in while placing freshly cooked pork on the table. Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“On the other hand, Lady Pendragon now is truly an angel, an angel I say.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I couldn't agree more! I’ve never seen such a pretty girl in my life. She smiles so brightly and frequently too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And what about Baroness Conrad? She is calm and considerate. I heard she used to be a maid in the duchy, but she never acts haughty either.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“She’s pretty, and she’s got a big chest too!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hohohoho!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone burst into laughter as one woman gathered up her chest and spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, I don’t think the baroness will be able to make it to breakfast this morning.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One lady tilted her head at the confusing words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn and the other women of the residence burst into laughter once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh my. You will be getting married soon, shouldn’t you know about it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? About what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean, about what? Because she shared an intimate time with the governor last night! The sounds were just… Phew!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh my! Oh my!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The maidens covered their mouths with red faces. But looking at their bright eyes, it was clear that everyone was expectantly imagining something in their minds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now, now, time’s running out. Let’s finish up and… Gahhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marilyn let out a shriek and froze on the spot. All the women in the kitchen turned to the source of the commotion in wonder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A newly arrived person was standing in the kitchen. Her face was bright red, as if all her blood had shot up to her head, and she was acting restless. Everyone who saw her hurriedly bowed their heads.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“B, b, baroness…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, we were just…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The women started trembling. They had made a joke about the concubine of the governor, and she had been listening the entire time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was natural that they would be kicked out, and in all likelihood, they would be punished as well. Some even had tears in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But then,</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“From now on, I will try to be… as quiet as possible… It wasn’t on purpose. I just don’t have any experience… And it was hard, but not to the point where I couldn’t stand up…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The women raised their heads with blank expressions as Lindsay spoke softly in a shameful voice.</span></p>
