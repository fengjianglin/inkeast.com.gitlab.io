 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The winter sea breeze was cold and prickly enough to split the skin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna stood on the balcony located on the back of the boat and looked towards the far, long coastline.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They said we will be arriving in Leus tomorrow, Lady Seyrod. By the way, how are you faring with your sea sickness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo, the boy Baltai assigned to Luna, asked with concern. Luna nodded lightly in response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am fine now. Thank you for your concern.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t mention it. Hehe!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna smiled at the boy’s cute smile. Rollo was quick-witted and intelligent for his young age.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you too, Carlin.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You do not need to worry about it. We are only performing our duties. The wind is quite harsh, why don’t you go in?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Carlin spoke courteously. However, Luna lightly shook her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am fine. I would like to see the sun go down. You two can go in first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo and Carlin bowed to Luna before entering the cabin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once again, Luna turned her head towards the horizon and observed the setting sun. The sun hung on the thin boundary and blushed the surface of the water. The sunset in the inland sea was so wonderful and beautiful that one could not take their eyes off of it. But at the same time, it appeared lonely as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna sighed. Its lonely appearance was probably due to the state of her own heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She would be able to see him in a day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She thought that she would explore her own future as well as the future of the Seyrod family by his side. She had thought that an opportunity would present itself in York Town, the new city of the Pendragon Duchy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But instead, he headed towards the far-off imperial castle, then proceeded to show an unexpected but brilliant performance in front of the emperor himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He seemed to be getting farther and farther away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps he was even farther than the time when she met him for the first time after he woke up from his unconscious state a few years back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna felt somewhat foolish that she had trusted herself to be able to revive the Seyrod family by herself without leaning on a man. Everyone had told her that it was impossible for a woman, and that it would be the best choice for her to marry into a prestigious family instead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But she did not listen. All the young nobles who chased after her were foolish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Breeden, now deceased, was a prime example. It was terrible just to imagine spending the rest of her life with stupid, immature men who were filled with arrogance and desire. Therefore, she decided to pioneer her own destiny and lead her family as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the world was not so green.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone judged her as Luna Seyrod, the girl who would connect the Seyrod family to another family with marriage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hard-earned knowledge was useless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a noble society, women’s knowledge was even less valuable than the ability to embroider. Men only wanted a pretty, submissive Lady Luna Seyrod, a woman who would allow them to make the Seyrod County their own.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘But…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna pressed down on her beating heart. ‘He’ popped into her mind unconsciously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He did not desire the glory of the Seyrod family. It was not due to his status as the heir to a duchy. He did not care even though he knew that there were lots to be gained from marrying Luna Seyrod.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He also did not care for women’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only person he accepted as a woman was a maid who had stood by his side since his reawakening. Even Ingrid, who was enchanting even to fellow women, did not catch his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, the White Dragon Soldrake seemed to have the closest relationship with him, but their relationship was too ambiguous. It simply could not be called an amorous relationship, a love between a man and a woman. Rather, their relationship was similar to that of a parent and their child. It felt like a predestined bond.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alan Pendragon…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Herself included, he did not care for a woman’s status or beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After Luna accepted that fact, she also realized that the man she wanted could hurt her heart so cruelly. The man who saw her for who she was did not care for her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She had no idea it would be so heartbreaking. When she met him, the truth would dig in even deeper, and it would hurt even more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, she had to go to Leus, and she had to see him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The pain of not seeing him would be even greater…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alan…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Luna whispered the name of the man that occupied her heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the name quickly scattered in vain as a cold breath rising in the colorful sunset.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What a stupid girl.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo muttered in a derisive voice as he looked down at Luna from high on the balcony.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That very stupid love is leading us straight to him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo shrugged at Carlin’s blunt words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I guess so. Without that girl, it would have been harder to get so close to Duke Pendragon. Thanks to her, things will work out easily.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pendragon is an unusual man. If he raises the dragon’s spirit, he could discern our energy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph! You just take care of that Valvas Cavalier called the Orc Slayer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo snorted, and Carlin turned his head towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His gray eyes shone eerily in the red sunset.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even a Cavalier of Valvas is no match for me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Chet…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo pouted his lips grumpily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Carlin was right. It was difficult to count the number of Valvas Cavliers that had fallen at the hands of Carlin, single-handedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyhow. Why did the Nameless Necromancer order us to use this in taking care of him?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo spoke while taking something out of his bosom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a dagger studded with skeletal fragments on the handle. The blade of the dagger was embedded with ancient words and a dark, green light glowed eerily on the tip of the blade. It gave off a truly ominous feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It must be equipped with one of his spells. We just have to complete the request.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fine. Hehe, I wonder how it’s going to feel to stab Duke Pendragon with this dagger, hehehe…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rollo responded with a grin and put the dagger back into his bosom. Then, the evil energy disappeared like a lie.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is complete, your excellency.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The temporary butler, Romeo, stuck out about a dozen sheets of paper while sweat droplets formed on his forehead. After reading the words written on the paper, Raven stamped each sheet with his ring seal with a satisfied expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. Put them up on the streets that see the most traffic, from the gate all the way to the central square. Leave one behind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Romeo hurried out of the governor’s office after bowing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven noticed someone’s expression while heading back to his chair. He broke into a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What, are you worried?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“N, no sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon quickly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is nothing to worry about. This is the only way in this situation anyways.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon hesitated for a moment and carefully replied to Raven’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even so… I am a little concerned, my lord. I am sure that some people who have a relationship with Sagunda might be coming.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That would be better, actually. We will be able to filter them out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spread the paper on his desk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Leus is a big city. In order to maintain a city like this, it is essential to recruit competent officials. But as of now, I only have the two of you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The words written on the paper sheet was Raven’s first official act as the governor-general of Leus. Its content was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyone who wishes to be an official of Leus and share in the will of the new governor, come to the governor’s residence at noon tomorrow. Anyone who is a citizen of Leus and pays taxes is eligible regardless of nationality or status.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven recited the words aloud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A bloodbath had occurred in Leus after Sagunda’s death, and there was essentially no management with the exception of the port. Most of the previous officials were either relatives of Sagunda or had bribed him to get their seats.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were a few people left, but it was not nearly enough to properly operate the huge port city which was plunged into chaos. Thus, Raven had to first appoint new, competent people as officials and place them into proper places as the new governor of Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In this way, Raven would be able to make contact with ‘them’ who could either prove to be a strong ally or the biggest enemy in governing Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Leus Parliament… How will they react?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven muttered, and Isla responded in a quiet voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They should already be aware of your presence, my lord. They will be reading the notice tomorrow, so I believe they should be coming to the residence tomorrow as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leus was one of the busiest ports and trading cities in the empire, and it had its own parliament. When people of numerous races and nationalities gathered, there was a need for an organization to coordinate them, even with the presence of certain policies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Naturally, the governor held the greatest power as the representative of the emperor, but it was impossible to suppress even the foreign merchants solely by imperial law. It was because a huge blow would be dealt to Leus if foreign merchants protested collectively against the city.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, several foreign merchants and Leus natives that were respected by the people came together to form a parliament. Although their decisions had no direct impact on issues, they conveyed their wills to the governor as a type of request or recommendation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, the past governors set the city’s policy while considering the opinions of the parliament as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With one exception – Count Sagunda.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t believe that six of the nine members of parliament belonged to Sagunda… This definitely wasn’t the City of Leus. City of Sagunda would have described it better.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven shook his head with a wry look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From officials to the parliament, Count Sagunda had the city of Leus completely within his grasp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyways, I am looking forward to tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The issue with the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment had been solved, but there were still many important issues to take care of.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven had no doubts that solving the problems one by one to stabilize Leus would be the way to ultimately punish the pirates in the inland sea, and then to press the Arangis family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“L, line up!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The door will open soon! Please line up!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Romeo and the other employees raised their voices. However, the crowd gathered in front of the governor’s residence did not easily calm down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though the sun was not yet in the sky, there was a large commotion in front of the governor’s residence. More than a hundred people were shaking their identification tokens and letters of recommendation in front of the iron gate, making a large fuss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of them had come in order to become city officials after reading the posted announcements yesterday afternoon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oi, don’t push!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey! You can’t cut in line!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did you say? I was waiting here from dawn. I happened to go to the washroom for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven had chosen the method of selecting officials after hearing Vincent’s advice. It seemed to be even more effective than he thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From elderly noblemen to foreigners with brown skin and round hats, all sorts of people had gathered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kieeeek.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps due to the massive group, the iron gate of the governor’s residence opened earlier than scheduled. The people started to rush into the building as they saw an opening.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop right there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A low, forceful voice resounded, and two people blocked the entrance to the residence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The swarm of people was reminiscent of a predator chasing prey, but they stopped when they saw the two people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His excellency the governor-general will be out soon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Isla spoke with Leon by his side. When the people noticed the two small blades that hung on his sides, they gulped loudly. Some were able to recognize Isla from his endeavour in defeating an orc, and they let out low exclamations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The disorderly crowd quickly settled down. After a while, Isla took two steps to the side, and a man walked out of the entrance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The people’s gazes filled with wonder as they saw the young duke, who had first shaken the imperial castle, now greeting them as the new Governor-General of Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Standing on the stairs, Raven looked around calmly before opening his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Alan Pendragon, the new Governor-General of Leus. I sincerely welcome all of you who have applied to become city officials. As noted on the announcement, anyone who pays taxes in His Majesty’s City of Leus is welcome, regardless of their status or nationality.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ooooh!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many people had been frustrated until now because they had no connections or bribes. They burst into cheers at Raven’s words which reached down to them like a lifeline.&nbsp;</span></p>
