 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">15 days passed since Raven accepted Leon into the party. The road became quite rugged, and Raven ended up purchasing a carriage. There was no reason for everyone to experience discomfort while traveling on the back of horses, especially with the addition of new members. Moreover, the appearance of the two ladies, especially Irene, was too eye-catching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So the group passed through the Seyrod territory and the Koran territory and finally arrived at the Alice territory, which could be called the entryway into the central part of the empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Great Territory of Alice was considered one of the three richest and most powerful territories of the empire. The natural scenery was outstanding with a large number of rivers and lakes, and their commerce was quite advanced with a rich history.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The most famous place in the Alice territory was Edgel, the city where High Lord Count Louvre’s castle was located. Edgel was the center of the Alice territory, and it drew from a tributary stream of Dantes River, which ran all the way across the central part of the empire, to create huge waterways in the city. The city was always bustling with a constant stream of tourists and travelers all year round.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Louvre family’s symbol, the Cosmos flower, bloomed in full during late summer throughout autumn, and it decorated the paths along the waterways as well as the rest of the city. This created a stunning sight that was renowned throughout the entire empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The view was excellent, and the city was always crowded and plentiful, which meant that there were frequent festivals, including the Dantes Festival, held in autumn. The Dantes Festival was the largest and most extravagant festival in the entire Alice region.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The 10-day festival was held throughout the entire territory of Alice, and the finale was decorated with a jousting competition and a duel competition, personally hosted and overseen by High Lord Count Louvre.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So at this time of the year, hundreds of knights and mercenaries flooded to Edgel to show off their skills and to try their luck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow… I never realized there could be so many people on the road. Don’t you agree, brother?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene was constantly glued to the window of the carriage, and Raven nodded indifferently at her exclamations. However, the huge procession of crowds that filled the streets had also caused Raven to be shocked considerably.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Alice, Graem, and Shia. The three territories are considered to be the most powerful… This is almost the size of a kingdom.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Four days of seeing and experiencing the Alice territory shocked Raven in various ways. The town of Lowpool was the largest in the Pendragon Duchy, and it was located right beneath Conrad Castle, which meant that it was the center of the duchy. However, they had already passed through two villages that were comparable to Lowpool with populations of two or three thousand, and they would soon arrive in Edgel, which was considered the center of the Alice territory. It had a population of over 20,000 residents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This meant that Edgel and the other villages within a two, three day distance had a combined population that rivaled or surpassed the entire Pendragon territory.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moreover, with the ongoing festival, there were thousands of visitors flowing into Edgel every day. This was truly a jaw-dropping event.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I still have long ways to go…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt slightly bitter, but he was not disappointed. According to Vincent’s predictions, the Pendragon Duchy would also grow considerably large by this time next year.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord, I can see the gates of Edgel. We are almost there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon spoke boldly from the coachman’s seat of the carriage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I guess we are finally here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene and Lindsay looked at each other with bright faces in anticipation of finally seeing Edgel, which they had only heard about in stories before.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The carriage passed through the castle gate after a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two ladies turned their eyes out the window.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They gazed out the window at the slow-passing scenery with admiration in their eyes. The three, four story buildings lined the cleanly maintained roads, and the faces of those filling the streets were full of life and vigor.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two ladies’ astonishment reached its peak when they crossed a bridge that lay above the world-famous waterway - a central monument of Edgel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were large and small boats floating on the wide waterway, which was well over 100 yards across, and the sides of the waterway were covered with many people enjoying the autumn festivals, as well as many shops and stalls targeting the tourists.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! I have never seen so many people before, Lady Irene.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. There are so many things to see, and it looks really fun!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two ladies slowly turned their heads toward Raven. They had only stayed overnight in towns for the past 15 days, and the rest of the journey was spent in the carriage, without any excitement or adventure. Of course, the two ladies were content and happy just to be able to travel with Raven, who was their brother and husband. But even so, when they were stuck 15 days straight with the quiet, impassive man, they felt a little bored.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike Raven, who was almost 30 years old, spending over ten years on the battlefield, the two girls were in their prime.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you two say so, I will grab us a place by the side of the waterway.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two ladies opened their eyes wide and asked in a united voice at Raven’s unexpected response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. We have to spend about four days here anyways. I have people to look for, and things to do…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What things…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t worry about it. Let’s decide on where to stay first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven answered with a grin, then stuck his head out through the window.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go down to the waterfront and see if there’s any good accommodation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord!”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon answered vigorously and turned the carriage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The river breeze carried the freshly faded cosmos petals, which was beginning to cover the road and the water with splendor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After passing by the tower of Goddess Lumina, one would eventually see the castle of Count Louvre after walking along the northern road for a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Louvre County’s Cosmos Castle was rather small and compact even though the Alice territory was one of the three strongest powers in the entire empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, any knight would have to watch their behavior after learning about the Knights of Cosmos that resided in the castle. They were 50 of the strongest knights that came from the different noble families of the Alice territory, and the Knights of Cosmos competed for the title of the strongest knighthood in the empire, excluding the imperial knights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Naturally, this did not apply to Louis Slynne, the eldest son of the Slynne Family. He had nothing to be cautious of in the castle. After all, the Slynne Barony had faithfully served the Louvre family for five generations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dammit… what’s with the atmosphere in the castle? As if they have to mourn for the ass handling.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Young master, please lower your voice a little. His excellency must be in a bad mood because of the competition, it would be bad for anything to befall us.”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The servant boy quickly whispered in Louis’ ear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk! Wel… uh, there he comes.”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis clicked his tongue and dismounted his horse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome, Lord Slynne. His excellency is in the palace.” The castle general greeted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the palace? There are many eyes and ears. I think the office might be better…”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis frowned at the castle general’s words and walked after him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have notified him of your coming, so he should be heading to the office. Anyways, his excellency is very unhappy with the results of the first preliminary round of the duels today. He must have been quite upset that only three of your knights were able to advance. He called for all the knights within the castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But we still had eight knights advance in the jousting competition, right? I am sure that the Knights of Cosmos will win this year as well, in both jousting and the duels.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Louis already knew the reason for the High Lord’s sulky mood, he responded rhetorically.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I suppose that will be the case for jousting. But we cannot know the results of the duels for sure. Who knew that His Grace Eder would lose so badly in the first match of the preliminary rounds?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The general answered with a sigh, and Louis also licked his lips in a regrettable manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wel… No one expected that old man to be so strong. Was it Argos? It is a name I have never heard of before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Some mercenary groups had a long history and a high reputation, and there were also individual mercenaries who were known for their outstanding skills and abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But they tended to be recruited by nobles from all over the empire as knights, and it was extremely rare for mercenaries to spread their fame as only mercenaries for a long time. Those that did not choose to serve under nobles usually formed their own mercenary groups with others.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the man named Argos belonged to neither category. Most importantly, he was almost fifty years old and he would have retired a long time ago as a mercenary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyways, how is His Grace Eder doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew! He finally passed the crisis. He is in a stable condition, but he doesn’t seem to be faring too well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm, is that so.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man named Argos had defeated Eder, who was one of the Knights of the Cosmos and the third son of Count Louvre. However, Eder had not become a knight at the young age of 20 solely because of his father’s influence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eder was a young man of considerable caliber.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He practiced swordsmanship since he was a toddler, and after he matured, he invited all the renowned knights and swordsmen that visited the Alice territory to learn from them and to share bouts with them.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eder was a gifted young knight who was able to beat all of the knights after battling them three times.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But now, Eder had been horribly defeated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He lost not to a knight, but to a mercenary. Moreover, to a bare-handed fighter…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis clicked his tongue inwardly and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fighters were quite rare. There were only a few of them among the noble families, and even less in the mercenary world. No one was foolish enough to forego their weapons as mercenaries, as they constantly got involved in battles and wars.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even the very rare fighters that appeared once in a blue moon used simple daggers.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the old fighter named Argos fought with nothing but a black glove with metal knuckles, using his whole body to fight and knock down three knights and mercenaries today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Slynne, you already know what his excellency is going to talk to you about. You are our only hope. You need to win the duels, and His Grace Morgan has to win the jousting competition. That way…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis laughed and cut off the general’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I can lose to His Grace Morgan in a very tight, very close battle between the victors.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Over the past decade, there had never been a case where a knight or mercenary from another region had taken the crown in the competitions held in Edgel.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seven or eight times out of ten, the Knights of the Cosmos won in both competitions, and once or twice, the children of the Alice territory’s nobles or their knights won the competitions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the Knights of the Cosmos were excellent, it wasn’t all due to their skills. The knights of Alice were able to interfere with the competition by eliminating possible challengers or scheming against them beforehand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That’s how Morgan, the eldest son of Count Louvre, and Eder, the third son, were able to win both of the competitions in the previous year. Afterward, the two brothers had a duel between the winners, and the older brother was able to claim a narrow victory which ended the festival with a beautiful result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But this year, last year’s victor was defeated by a fighter of unknown origins at the beginning of the competition without being able to do anything. Eder had suffered broken ribs after a battle with the fighter. Hence it was impossible for Count Louvre to have both his sons win the competitions again, which was why he was put in such a bad mood. There was only one solution to overcome this reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lewis Synne was the strongest swordsman of Alice territory in reality. He would have to be crowned victor of the duels, then lose to Morgan in the final battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m glad Lord Slynne understands. After the festival, you will be honored and rewarded separately by His Excellency. But before that…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know. I will take care of that old fighter. No need to worry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A confident smile hung around the mouth of Louis Slynne as he knocked on the doors to Count Louvre’s office.</span></p>
