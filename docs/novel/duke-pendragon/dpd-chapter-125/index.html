 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few lonesome lanterns drove the darkness into a corner, and the atmosphere of the room was generally quiet.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the glare of the old man staring at the young man was like a volcano on the verge of eruption. It was a complex gaze composed of shock, doubt, and unutterable worries.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You want me to believe in the words of a man who cannot reveal their name and identity?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The face of Argos, the Black Tiger of the demonic army, was fierce. His fist was clenched tightly and shaking as if waiting to decimate the young man’s head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I could smash your head right now. How do you know about those kids? Did you… Were you also involved in that… filthy act? You would not know otherwise.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos did not hide his killing intent, but Raven stayed calm facing the ferocious momentum. It was because Raven knew too well where the anger of the old, but strong man was stemming from.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Firstly, this is the first time in my life that I have come to Alice. Second, even if it’s you, you won’t be able to smash my head that easily.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos observed the young man who was remaining nonchalant bearing the full brunt of the killing intent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your latter words may be true, but I cannot believe your first statement.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It doesn’t matter if you believe it or not. But in two days, my words will prove themselves. Moreover… I will make sure that the truth of the matter of your son and daughter-in-law will become known to the world.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man’s face distorted rapidly. However, a hopeless laugh escaped through his thick lips soon after.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keu! Khuhuh…! Kahaha! I’m so thankful that I could cry. But, will that bring them back to life?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes grew bitter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My children… they headed to the afterlife before their father… My son and my daughter-in-law, who were slaughtered by a dog-like bastard. Will they come back to life?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old tiger growled with the sorrows of losing its child.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And a hidden anger threatened to devour everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t need it. Those inhumane bastards will die by my hands in two days. That’s enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He opened his mouth while gazing at Raven with bloodshot eyes. It seemed as if tears of blood could flow out any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They deserve death, so obvious they need to die. But that’s all. You will become a murderer who killed a local knight. You can’t even kill Morgan Louvre.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…….!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos’ bloodshot eyes trembled for the first time at Raven’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the world will never know what happened to your son and daughter-in-law, and what kind of human beings Morgan Louvre and Louis Slynne really are. Can you really be satisfied with that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kuegh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos gnawed his teeth with a groan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Morgan Louvre and Louis Slynne, both of them needed to die. There was no point if one of them remained alive.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To strike and kill both of them, was the only revenge that could be achieved to ease the souls of his son and daughter-in-law who were slaughtered by the two swine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven continued while observing Argos, whose eyes were gradually regaining calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And I assure you, you will not be executed. You will be forced into the demonic army, the spearhead of the imperial army. You will have to fight alongside dirty scoundrels like Morgan. You will fight on all sorts of dirty battlefields until you die. But if you listen to me, I will make sure you avoid the death penalty and being sentenced to the demonic army.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How is that possible?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos asked in an icy voice after regaining his cool.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Revenge was a dish best served cold.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old, wise tiger knew too well that it was harder to achieve vengeance with a hot head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Win the dueling competition, but don’t kill Louis Slynne.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. He deserves to die. I will pull out all of his limbs and kill him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos spoke while gritting his teeth, and Raven responded apathetically.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then Morgan Louvre will live, and you will be sent off to the demonic army after getting your tongue cut off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Keugh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">…:”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though he was fuming with anger and resentment, Argos knew that the young man’s words had merit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then… you really have a way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. You won’t lose out, so would you like to hear it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos nodded silently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is the plan…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a serene, calm voice, Raven began to explain his plan that would result in the deaths of the two beasts while saving the righteous man who would be of great help to Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome back, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon bowed deeply, and Raven gave a simple nod.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, did anything happen? What about Irene and Linsday?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There was nothing unusual. The lady and the baroness retired to their bedrooms after chatting until a little while ago. They asked me to wake them up once the lord returned…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Leave them. They must have been tired, so we’ll let them get some rest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven took his cape off and flopped down in front of the fireplace.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon was starting to become accustomed to Raven’s unusual behaviors that were unbefitting of his status. He took out a small pot hanging from the fireplace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would you like a cup of tea?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sure. You can use that cup.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon poured tea and held out Raven’s favorite crude tin cup before sitting down beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you manage to take care of your business?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Somewhat.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon hesitated for a moment at Raven’s answer and asked cautiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Um, is the matter…. Related to the fighter named Argos?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You pick up quite quickly for a stubborn man. Did you hear about it downstairs at the pub?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, coincidentally…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon bowed his head with embarrassment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The pub’s guests were all talking fervently about the dueling and jousting competitions, and there were a few participants that had garnered their attention. Along with other young, strong knights and mercenaries, Argos was also discussed as a hot topic.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And when Leon heard of Argos’ unique identity as a fighter, he remembered what Raven had told him after accepting him, that Leon would become a fighter. He noticed the connection.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Argos. An invincible fighter who mastered the techniques of the&nbsp;</span><span>Tiramis</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Temple. He is the man who will guide you in the art of fighting.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as Leon expected, so he started to glisten with joy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But he has experienced something unimaginable, and he is in a complicated predicament. Well, if everything goes as planned, there should not be any problems…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there a circumstance?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is a very special situation. But… it will be resolved in two days. Those who deserve death will die, and those who deserve life will live.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes shone coldly through the rising steam, and Leon felt an unknown chill run down his back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A day passed by very quickly during festivities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">More people came to Edgel to enjoy the festival as it neared the end, and everyone’s attention turned to the dueling and jousting competitions.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected, the winner of the jousting competition was Morgan Louvre.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he defeated two knights in a row without having to switch out his wooden lance more than three times, no one was surprised because it was the result that the majority expected in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But a completely unexpected result came out of the dueling competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrary to everyone’s expectations, the oldest contestant had advanced to the final.&nbsp;</span><span>He advanced after completely decimating Sir Jonjo and Sir Edenfort, two of the strongest knights of the Alice territory, as well as&nbsp;</span><span>Dulcein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, one of the leaders of the famous mercenary group, the Waves Brothers.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next opponent of the old fighter, who had climbed rapidly after achieving consecutive victories, was none other than Louis Slynne, the one regarded as one of the strongest knights of Alice along with Morgan Louvre.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So the next day, as the sun shone directly overhead, the last match of the competition between Argos, an unknown, old fighter, and Louis Slynne, the Guardian Sword of Alice, finally began.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Slynne! Slynne!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shouts supporting the crowd’s favorite local knight resonated throughout the stadium.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Waahhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis Slynne entered the stadium wearing a light, sturdy leather armor coated with thin metal and a family-heirloom longsword on his waist. The roar increased and reached its peak at his appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wreaths and handkerchiefs were thrown by his lady fans, and Louis walked to the middle of the stadium with a confident smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A moment later, a man appeared from the other side of the stadium. He began to walk forward slowly.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His black hair was tied up, and he wore a loose black shirt that revealed his hard, muscular chest. His pants were also jet black, matching the colors of his hair tie and shirt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Each one of his steps was heavy and prudent.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Above all, the black gloves that had been used to crush his previous opponents were so menacing that one felt pressure at the mere sight of the deadly armament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ohh! It’s the tiger! The old tiger came out!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean old tiger? It’s the black tiger!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whaaaa!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The cries of support for Argos also rang out, although it wasn’t as loud as the support for Slynne. In any match, there were people who supported the underdog, and Argos fit the description as a commoner and a relatively weaker warrior.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Hmph! Those bunch of idiots, cheering for an old man who’s going to die soon.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis’s eyes glared disapprovingly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he noticed something strange as he looked at Argos, who was walking towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What’s wrong with that old man? This is a little weird…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he was sometimes overshadowed by Morgan, Louis was a strong knight that also knew how to use the spirit. And as he looked at the old man, he could see a black energy rising up from the old man’s eyes like an active volcano.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Showing your spirit before the fight starts? No, that expression…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The identity of the energy contained in the old man’s eyes was murderous intent that was brimming with anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ha! This crazy old man is courting death.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis became aggravated and also roused up his own spirit.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had been thinking it was a little impressive for a commoner old man to have climbed up to the finals, but now he realized that the opponent was a senile old man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Whooosh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two men’s spirits clashed in the middle of the stadium, causing a strong gust of wind.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Spirit wasn’t visible to ordinary people.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But when the two men’s spirits clashed violently, the audience felt goosebumps on their bodies. They felt repressed and closed their mouths.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, the general of the Alice territory stood up and announced while looking at the silent stadium.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The one who rules the land on behalf of the fair and just Emperor of our glorious empire! The High Lord, the ruler of the land of abundance! His Excellency Leonardo Van Louvre!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the general’s announcement, about a dozen trumpets played a long, majestic sound. An elderly man wearing a brilliant silver robe and a gold crown descended to the dignitary seat.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With his appearance, the nobles, as well as the commoners, all stood up and showed respect by taking off their hats or bowing; b</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ut not everyone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No one noticed because they were bowing, but there was someone in the upper rows of the stands that stood straight.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was Raven.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene and Lindsay had slightly lowered their heads, but Raven did not need to initiate a bow in front of anyone except the emperor. He looked towards the High Lord of Alice with misty eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Today will be the day that your son pays for his evil deeds.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He felt rather mixed up because he had no relations with the High Lord, but there was nothing that could be done.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now! Let me introduce you to the loyal knight of the Great Territory of Alice, the son of Lord Synne, the Guardian Sword of Alice. Louis Slynne!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Waaaaaaaah!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shouts that died momentarily with the High Lord’s appearance were reignited and shook the arena.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A moment later, the general spoke once more, coughing rather disapprovingly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Birth unknown! Sect unknown! Let me introduce you to Argos, the fighter!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whaaa!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Boooo</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cheers and disapprovals broke out at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Argos remained unshakeable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Two warriors who have reached here after a long, arduous road! I look forward to a fair fight!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thousands of pairs of eyes gathered in one place with the general’s last words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Woosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The cold wind swept through the stilled arena, and Louis Slynne slowly drew his sword. He had long withdrawn his spirit back in. Louis took on a hostile expression and pointed his sword, which had taken countless lives, at the fighter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You must be feeling pretty good about beating Eder, old man. Sorry, but you’re going to have to die today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos remained silent.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He kept his gaze towards the cold, clear sky with a vain expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This crazy old man dares to…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis regarded the gesture as disrespect towards him and fluttered his tongue with a colder glow of the eyes. It was a gesture that accompanied an extreme intent to kill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Shh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just as Louis took his first step, Argos’ gaze slowly left the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis flinched.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The blank, old man was no longer there.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Wooooooosh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A wild beast took his place.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A wild beast with flaming red eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A wild beast that had lost its children.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wild beast charged towards his nemesis.</span></p>
