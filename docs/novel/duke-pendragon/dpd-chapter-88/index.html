 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The cavalry galloped at high speeds with the flag of the Bresia County held up high in the front. They soon arrived in front of the monastery.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the leading cavalry moved aside, a nobleman in his fifties wearing a silver crown slowly rode forward. Upon seeing Raven sitting in the tent, the nobleman got off the horse without the help of his servant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Filmore’s gaze, the cavalry of Bresia bowed their heads. Normally, they would have bowed towards Sisak’s High Lord, but not this time around. Sophia and Baron Enzo’s expressions turned even more pale at this sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They once again realized that they were in the presence of someone with a higher status than Sisak’s High Lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Soon, High Lord Count Bresia passed through the calvary and the mercenaries and stood before Raven. His eyes fell on the miserable face of Ruv&nbsp;</span><span>Tylen</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;for a moment. At the High Lord’s icy gaze, Tylen trembled and bowed his head with a dejected expression, losing all the hope he had until now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Nobira and Sophia also had anxious, resigned looks on their faces. The tense silence only lasted for a moment, and Count Bresia turned to Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia’s expression turned bitter at the sight of Raven, who was much younger than himself but of a higher status. Then, Count Bresia slowly opened both of his arms and bowed deeply with one knee pulled back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As the representative of the most noble ruler of this land, Emperor Aragon, I, Lorean Bresia of Sisak, greet the descendant of the White Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The eyes of Filmore and Baron Nobira filled with shock at Count Bresia’s attitude towards Alan Pendragon. He was showing utmost courtesy that one would usually show in front of the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And the eyes of Raven, who had just received such a greeting, narrowed. Raven stood up front his chair and slightly bowed with one hand on his sword handle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m Alan Pendragon. It is an honor for me to meet your excellency, Lord Bresia.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia slowly straightened his posture after Raven’s courteous response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two men’s gazes met in the air in silence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Facing Count Bresia’s murky gray eyes, Raven felt a strange emotion. It was due to the differences that existed between Count Bresia in his distant memories, and the old nobleman who was standing in front of him right now. The man standing in front of him now showed a calm demeanor and a sense of oldness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please sit here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia sat in the chair placed right next to Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was Count Bresia who broke the awkward silence and spoke first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard my knights, and my daughter has done a great disservice to Your Grace Pendragon. I also heard that they acted against the solemn imperial order from the Royal Batallium.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven was quite surprised once again. He had not expected Count Bresia to bring up the subject in such a direct way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if there were some misunderstandings, mistakes are mistakes and faults are faults. As the father of my young daughter and High Lord over this territory, I feel a great responsibility. I hope you will make a fair and accurate decision on all of these matters. I will humbly accept your grace’s decisions... Even if it means death to everyone who was involved in the matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia’s last sentence caused a shocked expression to appear on everyone’s faces. Count Bresia’s words were no different from throwing the white flag. He meant to obey whatever arrangement Alan Pendragon made.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“F, father…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia Bresia’s last hope was shattered. She looked at Count Bresia with trembling eyes and a pitiful expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Count Bresia turned a blind eye to his beloved daughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He continued to stare at Raven’s face with calm eyes without a change in expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Was he such a man…?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded inwardly. Raven did not know that Count Bresia was a man of such caliber. He had thought that the old man was just a cowardly, incompetent nobleman who bought his title with money.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Naturally, Raven had clouded judgement as a young man full of despair and anger and could not see the man for who he really was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it was different now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The world he saw as a monarch was different from the world he saw as a traitor’s illegitimate child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven opened his tightly closed lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If that’s how your excellency feels, I will also speak without beating around the bush.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Three years ago, regarding the assassination attempt on Crown Prince Shio. Do you acknowledge your mistake and involvement in mishandling the incident and with what happened afterwards?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I admit it. I take full responsibility for mistaking a faithful knight of Sisak as the perpetrator and failing to recognize the real traitor. Those were my own thoughts, and those were my decisions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Filmore shouted in a regretful voice at Bresia’s confession.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord! Those were my..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Count Bresia’s face turned towards&nbsp;</span><span>Filmore</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stay silent, Sir Filmore.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Filmore closed his mouth and bit his lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I apologize for the rudeness of my knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded at Count Bresia’s apology. No excuses would change the situation. Not until the person holding the knife changed his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia was perfectly aware that making excuses or acting in thoughtless manner to shift the blame could cause his entire family to shatter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, simple recognition was different from accepting the responsibility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moreover, it should not have been easy for a High Lord to hand over the sword to someone else in his own territory. Nevertheless, that was what Count Bresia was doing right now, while showing the utmost courtesy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One could not simply treat such a person without thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia was not completely responsible for the fall of the Valt family and for the death of Raven’s father and brother, but in a way, he was also a victim.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had not been aware that the person who was staying in his castle was the crown prince, and he became caught up in a cunning plot devised by the traitors who had used Ruv Tylen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘But…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even so, Raven had a clear point to make.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was the purpose of his trip to Sisak as Raven Valt, and that was the reason he had used the name of a person who did not exist in this world to enact justice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven took a light breath and opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Excellency Bresia.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please speak, Your Grace Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Frankly, I am deeply impressed by your sense of responsibility as the High Lord of Sisak. However… In this place, where all your knights and vassals are gathered… I think it’s the right thing to do to correct the stigma of the extinct Valt family…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven ended his speech as he forcibly contained his trembling, breaking voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia looked at Raven with a strange expression, then nodded before standing up from his chair and taking a few steps forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone’s gazes headed towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With hundreds of eyes on him, High Lord Count Bresia spoke up in a declarative voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I speak as the High Lord of Sisak! Because of my mistake and wrong judgement, Sisak’s proud sword and shield met an unjust end! Even though a long time has passed, I will correct my mistake!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt his heart speeding up. Finally, the unjust judgement passed on to his family was about to be undone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“The&nbsp;</span><span>Valt</span><span>&nbsp;family is innocent! Gray&nbsp;</span><span>Valt</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was and will always be a loyal, proud knight of Sisak!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt his grip tightening on the armrest of his chair at Count Bresia’s loud declaration.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“The only sin that exists is my failure to conduct a deep investigation into this treacherous incident as Sisak’s High Lord! I declare before you, the people of Sisak! I will reinstate the&nbsp;</span><span>Valt</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;family as Sisak’s knight, and the residents of Moncha will once again be free men!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We accept the will of the High Lord!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers all bowed their heads and pounded their swords and spears on the ground. The sound also reached Raven’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Father… Jonathan…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His eyes had become red, and he silently closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only wish that had allowed him to continue living his hard life, which he held in his heart for more than a decade, was finally fulfilled. He had lived through all kinds of hells and chaos with only one desire in his heart, and now, the Valt family were no longer traitors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is not enough, but I hope this will be a small consolation to the Valt family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven opened his eyes at the words of Count Bresia who sat back in the chair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Correcting mistakes is the virtue of a true lord. Your Excellency Bresia&nbsp;</span><span>fulfilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;your responsibilities.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am ashamed. I am only grateful that you would think so, your grace. But…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia paused and pondered for a moment before continuing his words with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As I have said, I know I have full responsibility for this matter. I hope you can make it clear with me what you would like from me, your grace.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The comment fully revealed what type of character Lorean&nbsp;</span><span>Bresia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was. He was a man who held strong power in Sisak before ultimately becoming its High Lord. Raven responded calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I believe you have already received Sir Filmore’s letter. Firstly, I will receive the right to dispose of Ruv Tylen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is your right, so do as you would like.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am also going to confer the title of viscount on Derek Ramelda and appoint him as a lord over an independent territory. There will also be a small number of my troops present on his land. The matter has already been discussed with Prince Ian, so all you need to do is generously accept the matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will also follow your will on this matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia nodded his head heavily. He had already received this news the day before from Filmore’s letter. But the next words caused Count Bresia’s eyes to tremble.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lastly, I would like to offer you a word, or a suggestion, regarding the matter with Lady Sophia…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the first time, Count Bresia’s gaze unwittingly turned to Sophia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia had a complicated expression as he saw his youngest daughter crying with a frightened face. The cold voice of Raven stuck in his ears like a sharp thorn.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To reprimand her for insulting myself and the protector of my family, I want to take your daughter to my territory for a time of penitence and self-reflection.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“T, that…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia could not continue his words, and Raven answered with an icy expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am planning to leave this matter regarding Lady Sophia to my mother, Duchess Elena Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..Ah?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia’s forehead creased, and Sophia’s tearful eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leave his mother in charge of her? Then maybe she would become the Pendragon family’s’…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My mother was born in the imperial castle and she knows the strict discipline of the royal family better than anyone else. There’s no one better to educate Lady Sophia to become a proper lady than Duchess Elena. Of course, since your daughter is guilty..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The faces of the father-daughter duo paled as Raven continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“She will enter my castle as a maid.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spoke his last words with a hint of smile, and the two faces turned pale white like milk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A noble’s daughter, a daughter of a High Lord. A maid?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No, she would be called maid, but in reality, she would be no different than a hostage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Y, your Grace Pendragon, I beg of you, but please reconsider…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you think will happen if I report this matter to Prince Ian?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia stopped at the cold response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Your daughter became involved in a dispute between two knights of the territory while using the name of your family. She explicitly took a side as well. In the meantime, she interfered with me, who was carrying out a secret mission given to me by the imperial family. If you were Prince Ian, how would you choose to deal with this matter, your excellency? Moreover, how would you ‘take care’ of&nbsp;</span><span>Bresia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;County?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia clenched his eyes shut at Raven’s emphasized words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Needless to say, Sophia would be executed, and he would be stripped of his position as High Lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he refused, thousands of imperial soldiers would storm them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whoo…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bresia reopened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was nothing to think about. He could not lead his family and his territory toward destruction just because of his daughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please take good care of my… youngest daughter… Sophia…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Sophia&nbsp;</span><span>Bresia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The immature girl’s status immediately fell several stages from a High Lord’s daughter to a maid with just a few words. She fainted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From then on, the conversation was one-sided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia, who was forced to send his youngest daughter as a hostage in the name of ‘re-educating her with a systematic and strict discipline to reform her into a wise lady’, could not argue with Raven’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the contrary, his daughter was spared the death penalty, and his family was completely relieved of the responsibility for the incident three years ago, as well as the responsibility for his daughter’s actions this time around. The situation had ultimately turned out the best it could for Count Bresia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He also felt a little relief and gratitude that Alan Pendragon had found out the identity of some of the traitors that attempted to assassinate the crown prince. Even though Count Bresia shared in the responsibility, ultimately, he was also a victim, so he had a deep grudge against the traitors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That’s why Count Bresia wanted to maintain a close relationship with the Ramelda family, and also wanted to cooperate with the Pendragon family as the High Lord of the Great Territory of Sisak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was clear that the story of this incident would spread to the entire empire through the mouths of the mercenaries who participated in the conflict, and that the County would be greatly disgraced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So, it would be better for them to cooperate with the Pendragon Duchy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Bresia was disregarded by other nobles for a long time, and he had lived with that identity for a long time. But now, he chanced upon an opportunity to make ties with Alan Pendragon, who had joined hands with Prince Ian and was soaring in terms of influence and reputation. This was a golden opportunity to turn his disgrace into a huge fortune.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, during his long journey from Leus to Sisak, Raven gained two dependable allies in his travels – Viscount Ramelda, and High Lord Count Bresia.</span></p>
