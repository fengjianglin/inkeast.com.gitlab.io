 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I deeply appreciate your reply. I, Iron Elven, will remember what has transpired today as a knight and governor serving the empire.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elven showed courtesy and bowed politely with his hand placed on the handle of his sword. Then, he sat back down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sight of the Governor-General of Edenfield acting on the side of Alan Pendragon was enough to shock the nobles that were present. Edenfield was an important stronghold and a fortress that connected the southwestern territories to the imperial castle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The situation is turning rather strange.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know. I did not imagine that Governor-general Elven would turn his back on Count Louvre and in such direct fashion. Especially in Edgel…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t it because His Grace Pendragon is heading to the imperial city? Anyways, the situation is definitely turning favorably for His Grace Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how brightly the sun had been shining on the Pendragon Duchy, it was simply impossible for Alan Pendragon to overpower a High Lord, especially in a territory that was nowhere close to his own. Even with his strength as the master of the Pendragon Duchy, he simply had not enough strength, status, nor connection to be able to suppress a High Lord in their own territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was one difference between a High Lord and a Duke in terms of status.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">High Lords ruled their territories on behalf of the emperor, and they swore allegiance to the current emperor. Dukes were masters of their own territory, and they had a close relation to the Aragon family.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, High Lords had to show absolute loyalty towards the emperor, as the emperor represented the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Regardless of their true thoughts or intentions, High Lords could not openly support any other members of the royal family except the emperor, as such thoughts or actions could be constituted as treason.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But dukes were a little different.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the current emperor was judged to be shaking the foundations of the empire and harming the existence of the royal family, one or two duchies could agree to publicly support certain figures of the royal family and declare their intentions to enthrone the new figure.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, tyrannical, repressive emperors were very rare, so such incidents had occurred very seldomly in the history of the empire, where the public and the High Lords all turned their backs on the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As such, that was the only difference between High Lords and Dukes, which could be substantial or insignificant depending on the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, even a Duke could not easily throw their weight around in territories beside their own. They could not easily overpower or claim authority in front of the High Lords.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was why most of the nobles had thought it rash when Alan Pendragon revealed his status and intervened in the situation. They had judged him to be premature.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young man’s naïve intentions to prove himself would result in a great humiliation for the entire Pendragon Duchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But their expectations were completely off the mark.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alan Pendragon had turned the situation around and taken the justification while creating a reason to intervene. Now, he had even obtained support and goodwill from Governor-General Elven, an influential figure of the empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm, I don’t know if he’s bold, or if he’s lucky…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Luck or not, the flow belongs to His Grace Pendragon. If he recounts his story with the backing of Governor-General Elven, Count Louvre won’t be able to do anything about the matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The visiting nobles&nbsp;</span><span>chattered</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;while looking around the stadium, which was gradually becoming noisy.&nbsp;</span><span>The crowd’s&nbsp;</span><span>reaction</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s were not important to them.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What they were paying attention to was how this event would change the position of the Pendragon Duchy, and how Count Louvre would respond. It was obvious that today’s events would have a significant impact on the condition of the empire, and possibly on their own positions as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Louis Slynne! If you confess right now, I will spare your life. In addition, I will ask his imperial majesty to protect your family. So decide. Will you continue to protect the wicked devil who was masked as the territory’s heir? Or will you confess bravely in front of everyone!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis had been shivering pitifully until now. As Raven roared, his lips started quivering as well. Then, heckling and shouting burst out from the crowds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Booooo!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tell the truth! Louis Slynne!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What crimes did Morgan Louvre commit!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Confess! Tell the truth!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The people were even more infuriated after hearing the story of the knight who had lost his two daughters. They felt the sorrows and the rage that Ryan Dawson felt towards the two perpetrators when he raised his head towards the sky and cried out, admitting his shameful and desperate mistake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Say it, you dirty bastard!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Booo! Speak the truth!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though they were in the presence of the High Lord and armed soldiers, the anger of the crowd could not be dispelled easily after being ignited. Some men even attempted to jump over the stands into the arena.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Q, quiet! Everybody, silence! Quickly! Do something!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The general became startled at the response and shouted, and knights and soldiers hastily rushed in. Fights broke out between the soldiers and the crowd here and there.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The drinking of the festival overlapped with the sense of injustice and created a huge disturbance and chaos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the venue became noisy, Raven drew his face closer to Louis and whispered,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You idiot. Don’t you know that this is an opportunity for you to put down all the sins of Louvre?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis raised his head urgently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What, what…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A dead man speaks no tales. This is your only opportunity to survive.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis’ eyes took on a conflicted gaze at Raven’s tempting words.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was right. The dead did not speak.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was better to live and roll in a field of horse shit than to die.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had already lost his honor and power with how the situation was turning out. He had no other choice if he wanted to live, if he wanted to lessen his crimes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shut up, everybody! Shut up!”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Louvre shouted in anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The threat of the knights and the soldiers combined with the anger of the High Lord caused the pandemonium to slowly subside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Louis Slynne. Go ahead and speak. Tell me about my son with your own mouth.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis gulped several times facing the gaze of Count Louvre which was filled with killing intent. He eventually avoided the gaze and looked down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“It, it’s true. His Grace Morgan… He ordered me to attack the travelers. Then he violated the women in front of the men, then… then killed them all…&nbsp;</span><span>Keugh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! I, I was responsible for cleaning up the mess…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Louis told his story while groaning with pain, but it was clearly transmitted to the ears of the people around him and the nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t believe it…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“H, his Grace Morgan really…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Groans and sighs were heard from all over the place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uhg……uggghhh! That cannot be true! It can’t be!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Louvre threw his gold crown to the ground and went berserk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Louis Slynne! Do you realize what you are saying right now!? Oh, kuha, yes! You were in the same boat as them! Everyone conspired to kill my son, and now you are going as far as to dishonor his name with your slimy tongues!&nbsp;</span><span>Kuhehe</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone became speechless at the sight of the High Lord going on a frenzy after losing his reasoning.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But there was one exception.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will you continue to act so disgracefully even after clear evidence has been found? Watch yourself, High Lord of Alice!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Count Louvre jerked his head around to the source of the quiet, but powerful voice and&nbsp;</span><span>stared</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with a vicious expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Keugh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">…..!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The moment he faced the deep, cold, knife-like blue eyes, Count Louvre felt the sensation of cold water pouring over his head, and he barely snapped back to his senses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It’s over…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His eldest son was dead.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had died in a duel, and now he was labeled as a vicious criminal. All that remained was for Count Louvre’s family to take the fall.&nbsp;</span><span>His territory and vassals would remain, but it would be impossible for Count Louvre to enter the heart&nbsp;</span><span>of the imperial</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;politics in his generation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Who would continue to seek a relationship with the Louvre family, that had a deceased heir who raped and murdered countless women?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keuu…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Louvre raised his head with a groan filled with grief.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was neither a fool nor a villain.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He never failed his status as a High Lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the contrary, he was a High Lord who handsomely rewarded and strictly punished, though forgiving and generous towards small mistakes. He was a great lord.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he had lost his reasoning for a while due to the death of his beloved son, whom he had favored since he was a child, the sense of responsibility and judgment of the High Lord had not completely disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But…”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Louvre spoke in a vicious tone while looking towards Alan Pendragon, the man who was responsible for causing the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Morgan was the successor to the Great Territory of Alice. No matter what sins he committed, one cannot easily judge the life of a great territory’s heir unless he was treasonous. A life, at the least, will be required to be paid back. So, Your Grace Pendragon, you will need to provide a life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Louvre’s gaze slowly shifted from Raven. He met the gaze of Argos, who was barely standing with the help of Leon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do not think that your children's lives are equal to that of a great territory’s heir, old man. Only when you die, then will it balance out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“….Do as you please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos had lost his child, but he knew that the other party was also a father who had lost his child. He answered bitterly and closed his eyes. Count Louvre lifted his sword and was about to take a step when Raven interrupted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Unfortunately, that’s not going to happen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Louvre turned his head. His eyes seemed to be on the verge of shedding blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven turned his gaze towards the nobles, each who had a complicated expression, and spoke to one particular person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You there, your name was Gale Lambert, right? You were there when Morgan applied for a duel, weren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Well, yes, but…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young nobleman who stood up in surprise was none other than Gale Lambert, the one who had tried to flirt with Irene and Lindsay at the restaurant a few days back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tell me what I bet on the outcome of the duel with Morgan Louvre.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uh, we, well…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gale Lambert stuttered in bewilderment with the countless eyes on him, then continued in a feeble voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“One man’s… life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Speak louder.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gale Lambert shouted in desperation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“H, his Grace Pendragon and their group wanted one person’s life if they won the duel!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Louvre’s eyes trembled. Raven turned to face Count Louvre and continued,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We won the duel, so I have the right to claim my bet in return for our victory. I, Alan Pendragon, would like the life of Argos, the victor of the battle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Keugh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sword finally fell from the hand of Count Louvre, whose eyes were turning moist. Raven turned away after briefly observing the count, who seemed to have grown ten years older in a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Raven nodded&nbsp;</span><span>lightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to the old fighter who was shedding tears from his swollen eyes then turned to the nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The commotion was long. I also had not expected for it to turn out this way because of my retainer’s duel, but I could not overlook the matter as a knight, and as a Pendragon. I hope you understand, sirs and ladies. Then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven saluted lightly to the nobles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Governor-General Elven was the first to stand up. He took off his hat and bowed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I greatly appreciate the wise actions of Your Grace Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surprisingly, almost half of the nobles also stood up from their seats and showed courtesy to Raven. After making eye contact with all of them, Raven turned around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go. I think the festival is over now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene, Lindsay, and Leon, who was helping Argus, followed behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, the knights and the soldiers, who were still circling around them, stepped back and gave way to Raven and his group. With countless eyes on him, Raven left the venue with neither slow nor quick steps, away from the concluded festival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Less than three days later, the incident that occurred in Edgel’s stadium spread throughout Alice. And after Raven and his group completely exited the territory of Alice, the story had spread to the major cities and other great territories, as well as the islands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many nobles cut ties with High Lord Count Louvre’s family. The Great Territory of Alice, which was considered one of the best in the empire, was greatly dishonored by the evil deeds of Morgan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrastingly, the reputation of the Pendragon Duchy once again soared in the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone praised the wisdom and virtue of Alan Pendragon for helping the righteous revenge of a father, who lost his child, and punishing a wicked criminal, regardless of their status and position. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it wasn’t as if only positive outcomes stemmed from the incident.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other great nobles, especially High Lords, became more wary at the actions of Alan Pendragon in someone else’s territory.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Several High Lords even secretly exchanged letters with the Great Territory of Alice, which had become greatly damped by the incident.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was to keep Prince Ian and the Pendragon Duchy in check.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, not everyone raised their guard.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Several High Lords, including High Lords of Seyrod and Sisak, secretly sent people to the Pendragon Duchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everything seemed peaceful on the surface, but the conflict in the imperial city was also intensifying with the truth behind the attempted assassination of the crown prince being revealed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The High Lords had to be conscious of the fight for the position of crown prince, and they struggled to occupy the highland and to make judgments accordingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, the empire’s power struggle, which had been subsurface until now, had finally become turbulent due to this incident.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And the starting point was none other than Alan Pendragon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This incident proved him to be a resourceful and prominent man.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Naturally, there were some people who disregarded it as luck, and in fact, luck had played a rather big part. But great work tended to belong to those who were lucky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, Alan Pendragon was judged to be a man who had both luck and ability.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A fierce momentum.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alan Pendragon’s fierce momentum spread throughout the empire and headed towards the imperial castle.&nbsp;</span></p>
