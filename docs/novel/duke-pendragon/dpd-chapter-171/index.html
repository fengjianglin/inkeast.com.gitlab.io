 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her silver hair fluttered with the wind and glistened as the sun’s rays shone down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her eyes seemed to look far away and were indifferent, but it rather added a strange charm to the overall feel. Regardless of age or sex, people stared blankly at the female knight, unable to take their sights off her indescribable beauty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if feeling the people’s gaze, the female knight turned her head towards the crowd.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As she looked around, those that met her cold, gleaming eyes felt a suffocating feeling descending upon them. Everyone turned their gazes away at the same time due to a mutual feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was instinctive fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Somehow, they felt that something big would happen if they continued to stare at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As people averted their gazes, the female knight once again pressed her hood deeply before continuing as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People were freed from the strange, oppressive powers of the mysterious figure, and their eyes once again turned towards her. They simply could not shake off the overwhelming beauty and their curiosities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a while, quite a few people started to walk behind her in sync while stealing glances at her. Soon, a long procession had formed behind her, and it became apparent to the soldiers guarding the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A soldier let out a vain laugh and his comrade called out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look at that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm? What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldier’s eyes widened when he turned his gaze towards where his colleague was pointing towards. People who came to Leus usually travelled in groups of three, four, or at most five or six. However, an unusual sight was unfolding before them today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Along the road, the travellers were walking towards the gate in a line like a swarm of ants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is strange.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers glanced at the procession starting from the end, and their gazes travelled all the way to the forefront of the long line. They saw an unusually tall person adorned with a thin, silver robe unbefitting the season.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldier narrowed his eyes. He could see a sword glistening the light. A part of it could be seen sticking out of the robe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to see the appearance of the figure due to the distance, but there was a huge following behind someone who appeared to be a knight. Recognizing the strangeness of the situation, the soldier turned to his colleague.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s alert the captain.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Got it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle Vaughn, the company captain responsible for guarding Leus’ gates, displayed a curious expression after hearing the report from his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, they should be arriving soon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm, they might be a knight from the Pendragon Duchy. I will go personally greet them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After giving a salute, the soldiers climbed back onto the spire above the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The wind just isn’t giving me a day to rest, is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle Vaughn murmured in a quiet voice, his expression darkening.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the meantime, the procession of more than a hundred people led by the mysterious figure neared the gate. It was not long before the figure came to a stop in front of the gate. The people following behind her stopped as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sight was reminiscent of ducklings following their mother, which was quite puzzling to Kyle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People in carriages and other guards of the gate also turned their attention to the unusual sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle Vaughn clicked his tongue and approached the person in the silver robe before speaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I am Kyle Vaughn, a company captain of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;imperial regiment. Where are you from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle asked politely. Even though he could not see the face of the figure, he instinctively felt that they were not to be underestimated. It seemed Kyle had become used to the job after working as the gatekeeper for several months.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the figure remained silent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Ah, dammit! If I had my way, I would just…!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle Vaughn felt a little annoyance creeping up, and as he started speaking again, the figure took off their hood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their, or rather, her face was revealed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vaughn’s eyes started to gradually widen in surprise until his jaws fully unclenched as well. The soldiers and the other passersby could not hide their shock when they caught a glimpse of her face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her beauty could only be described as overwhelming, and even the current of air seemed to stop at her elegance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, just as it was a while ago, an unknown sense of oppressiveness was conveyed to everyone, and the passersby, the soldiers, and even the knights slowly lowered their heads to avoid eye contact with the lady.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Kyle Vaughn had experienced countless battles as a company captain of the 7</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;regiment, but the phenomenon held true for him as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘W, what the hell…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle Vaughn felt like he was going insane. He could not understand what was happening and felt frustrated at the happening. How could he act in such shameful ways as a knight of the imperial army and the captain of the Leus gate guards?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nevertheless, he could not raise his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A mysterious silence swept through the scene. All travellers and carriages stopped in their tracks, and everyone had their heads lowered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An unexpected person broke the silence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clop! Clop!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sound of hooves clacking on the ground grew louder from inside the gate, and someone shouted in a welcoming voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sol!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone, including Kyle Vaughn, barely turned their heads towards the cheerful voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The new governor could be seen jumping off his saddle with a brighter face than ever before. It had not been too long since the governor had returned to the residence with the group from the Pendragon Duchy, so Vaughn was surprised at his appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your excellency…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle Vaughn and the soldiers quickly straightened their postures and saluted the governor. However, he rushed past the soldiers and grabbed the hands of the female knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Wooong!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Others did not notice, but Kylve Vaughn felt the change as a veteran knight. A transparent membrane was erected around the new governor and the female knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have been waiting. Why are you so late?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just a moment ago, Raven had quickly rushed to his horse when he suddenly felt the energy of Soldrake. It had been months since he last saw the companion of his soul, so he firmly clasped her hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I was finding out the things that Ray talked about, and I was resting in the lair.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. By the way, why did you walk?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt a little puzzled. He knew very well that Soldrake did not have to walk through the gate with her powers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Because this is not the land of Pendragon. And unlike last time, I have to stay longer. I judged that it would be better to save some of my powers.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven nodded his head heavily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As she said, Soldrake would have to remain in Leus for at least a few months.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have a lot to talk about, so let’s go in… hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven was about to turn around, then he stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake was maintaining her grip on his hands, and it seemed like she was not about to let go.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Ray’s hands are warm, so I feel good. I want to keep holding them.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her expression and gaze were as calm as usual, but the warmth was naturally conveyed. It brought a ray of light to Raven who was thrown into considerable shock and confusion after Luna’s death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once again, Soldrake was the only one who made Raven feel that he was not alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, let us do that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a faint smile, Raven tightened his grip on Soldrake’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“E, excuse me, your excellency, this is…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kyle Vaughn stuttered after finally managing to lift his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though he could see the two people’s lips move, their voices could not be heard. He must have felt a great shock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm, I apologize for that, Sir Vaughn. This is Soldrake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Soldra… Keugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vaughn started to mutter the name before letting out a shocked cry with an equally shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"S, so, so, Soldrake?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The White Dragon of the Pendragon family?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shock was fully delivered to everyone else who had been secretly stealing glances at the female knight. Some people even fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Who would not know the legendary name?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The strongest existence that protected the Pendragon Duchy, the creature of olden myths and stories, was standing right in front of them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moreover, she appeared as a beautiful, mysterious woman.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a sight that was truly hard to believe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come on, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was still frozen, enchanted. Raven led Soldrake by the hand through the crowd.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But then, something amazing happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, great White Dragon…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Exalted one.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People in front of the gate suddenly started to kowtow on the floor or bow deeply.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s eyes narrowed at the unexpected response. But on second thought, it was quite natural.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The presence of Soldrake was quite familiar to the Pendragon Duchy as the guardian of the land. A resident of the Pendragon Territory would have seen Soldrake quite a few times, whether it be in her dragon form or in human form.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But things were different in other regions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ordinary people never got the chance to come across a dragon in real life. They might have heard about the legends of dragons, but only a very few lucky ones would have gotten to see an actual dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moreover, the tales of the dragons usually described the ferocity and the formidability of the dragons. Dragons were beings that decimated cities with one breath. They massacred other creatures and forcibly took away gold or jewelry mines from humans and dwarves.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Such a monstrous entity was now acting as the protector of the city along with the new governor. The people of Leus came to face a being that was no different from a god, so it was only natural that they felt a sense of reverence towards Soldrake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Also, port cities like Leus saw many sailors, and sailors tended to have more fear and superstitions about transcendent beings. There were large and small temples of the various gods, including Goddess Illeyna, and almost all merchant boats and fishing boats took part in ancestral rites and praying before setting sail.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please protect the Sea of Leus…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I hope this year will be plentiful in fish as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My son has been in the south for four months. Please keep him safe…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Some people even went as far as to pray to Soldrake about personal wishes, similar to the ones that would be made in the temples.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake was suddenly being revered as a living god, and Raven stopped walking and stood still for a while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After all, Soldrake had to remain in Leus for a while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was nothing wrong with her being considered the guardian of Leus, rather than a feared monster with overwhelming power. In this situation, it might even be of great help.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The previous governor died as the mastermind of the revolt, the new governor was almost assassinated during his banquet, and a daughter of a high lord was killed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entire city of Leus was plunged into a state of confusion due to the series of incidents. However, an absolute being had arrived at the side of the new governor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was certain to bring a sense of relief to the people of Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Ray, are we not going? Do you have some concerns?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake could not understand what other human beings were saying, so she was oblivious of the situation. As well, she would not be interested in them even if she did understand their words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven briefly stared at her before drawing her a little closer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it’s nothing. Something good happened because of you. Thank you very much, Sol.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spoke with sincerity. Just having Soldrake by his side made him feel at ease, but it was even more special this time around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake blinked her eyes a few times, then a rare smile appeared on her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[If Ray likes it, I like it as well.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two companions of the soul comforted each other with smiles while standing in the middle of the crowd.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rumors spread like the wind throughout Leus that the White Dragon Soldrake of the Pendragon Duchy had arrived in the city. On top of that, the whole city bustled with rumors of the White Dragon’s human appearance and that the dragon would help the new governor protect Leus in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This incident brought great change to the heavy atmosphere that had sunk in after the assassination attempt and the death of Luna Seyrod.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But not everyone was happy to see Soldrake come to Leus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A portion of the metropolitan city was unhappy with the new governor. They considered the presence of the Ancona Orcs and the White Dragon Soldrake a humongous threat to them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were the remnants of a secret organization that once followed the lead of the Dark King of Leus, Toleo Arangis -- an organization consisting of the inland pirates.</span></p>
