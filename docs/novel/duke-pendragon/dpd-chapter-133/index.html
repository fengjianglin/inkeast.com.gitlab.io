 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s become somewhat capable. In terms of teaching him, everything will come in due time, so you don’t have to worry, your grace.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even in front of his life’s benefactor, Argos still retained his strict and proud discipline as a teacher to Leon. Even Raven’s status as a duchy’s master and his contributions in helping Argos achieve his revenge could not deter Argos’ determination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven appreciated Argos’ attitude and nodded with an embarrassed smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My mistake. I will leave everything regarding his teachings to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, even to whether he lives or dies.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even after losing his arm, the peak fighter Argos’ eyes were very stern.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The town they were entering served as a relay station, and thus, it was quite easy to enter and exit the village. The group was able to pass through the gate without being stopped or checked.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps due to the town’s proximity to the center of the empire, the village was quite big and even had its own marketplace, which sold basic necessities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, the village was not protected by its own vigilante group, but rather soldiers who were uniformly dressed and armed to guard the low, but protective walls that surrounded the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite the chilly weather of early winter, the village was bustling with residents and tourists.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘To think that even a small relay station of the imperial directive would be comparable to the size of Lowpool…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt rather bitter as he looked over the entire village. The territories of the Aragon Empire were divided into the imperial directives and the great territories.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The village they were passing through was a part of the imperial directive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Imperial directives were lands that were ruled over by governor-generals that were appointed by the imperial household, and they accounted for about half of the empire’s territory.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The majority of the central empire consisted of the imperial directive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From east to west, it consisted of the origin of Dantes River, all the way to Mirin Port. From south to north, it stretched from the Aiji Plains, the largest granary of the empire, to the Torman Mountains, where the empire shared a border with the northern barbarians. Overall, it was about 1,400 miles wide and 380 miles long when looking at it from a map.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, large ports and militaristically strategic locations were also designated their own governor-generals from the imperial castle and their lands were similar in size to other small or medium-sized territories.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The group passed through many villages after crossing into the imperial directive ten days ago, and most of the villages had been around the size of lowpool.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I guess it makes sense, considering that there are supposedly fourteen million identifiable residents in the imperial directive…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he first heard, Raven was beyond shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Adding up the people of the thirteen great territories, the total population reached twenty million.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Pendragon Duchy was finally targeting populations of 100,000, and 200,000, but it seemed that they were nothing short of a firefly dancing in front of a full moon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The difference wasn’t purely in the numbers either.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The basic standards of living, the size of commerce and the agriculture in the Pendragon territory were incomparable to the imperial directive.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how much the Pendragon Duchy had improved after the reopening of the mausoleum, gold mines, and the crystal mines, the difference was simply too large.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A bystander might even compare the two and wonder if the previous dukes had done anything at all for the Pendragon territory.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the difference was not due to the incompetence of the previous dukes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a good reason.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For one, the duchy’s location was too remote.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a result, the floating population was quite limited and commerce could not develop normally.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The population was small from the very beginning, and it was only natural for the agriculture and ranching to be small-scaled.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In its prosperity, the Pendragon duchy had up to six or seven knights, but they all served the duchy out of their loyalties and were bestowed riches and property that were at best comparable to knights of other regular great territories.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, when they were at their peak, the population neared 100,000 and they had thousands of troops.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the peaks were always followed by troughs and the number of troops always diminished or were replaced by vigilante troops.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason was simple. There were no external threats to the Pendragon Duchy. No matter how strong the neighbouring great territories were, they could never invade the Pendragon Duchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even with hundreds of calvaries and thousands of infantries, they could not handle Soldrake, the guardian and the contracted creature of the Pendragon Duchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, Raven could summarize his learnings after summing up everything he saw and experienced throughout this journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like it or not, all the problems of the Pendragon Duchy stemmed from Soldrake.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time Soldrake existed as the duchy’s most powerful force, she was also a huge hindrance to its development.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he could not say it out aloud, especially in front of Soldrake.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldrake was the only one who knew the truth behind Raven’s identity, and the only one who still cared for him.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was impossible for him to say anything negative towards her or scold her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And… even though Vincent was unaware of the truth behind Raven’s identity, he would surely have recognized that the duchy’s problems originated from the existence of Soldrake.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps the knights and the nobles that served the duchy for a long time were also aware of the fact too.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, as was the case with Raven, no one could ever bring up the topic to the surface.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Who would dare to publicize and label the guardian god of the Pendragon Duchy as a problem?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Pendragon Duchy was Soldrake, and Soldrake was the Pendragon Duchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Duke Gordon Pendragon… and the other previous dukes. This is probably why they distanced themselves from Soldrake and fell into contemplation.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, they were humans. They must have had their own ambitions and goals as a monarch. But the moment they realized Soldrake’s presence was the biggest obstacle in their way, they would have despaired.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If they could develop the duchy on top of having Soldrake as the territory’s guardian, they would have become a gargantuan threat for the surrounding lords.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The anxiety and discontent of the lords would soon have passed on to the imperial castle, and the Royal family would have asked the Pendragon Duchy to refrain themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rejecting the imperial request would have been tantamount to treason.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The loyalty and devotion of the Pendragon Duchy towards the Aragon Royal Family was great.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, the previous dukes must have come to face with the fork in the road. They would have chosen to preserve and serve, instead of following their ambitions as a monarch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Don’t tell me… Did Vincent and Duchess Elena tell me to go alone with Lindsay to the imperial castle to enlighten me of this?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven was convinced that this was the case.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Otherwise, the heir to a duchy would never be allowed to set off for a paramount journey to meet the emperor with just his concubine.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he had left with a large delegation composed of knights, soldiers, and servants, he was sure to have received many invitations by several lords on his way.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A series of banquets and welcoming receptions…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was obvious that he could not have experienced the realities of the imperial directive and the other great territories.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the first place, Raven had also shared similar thoughts and planned to only bring one or two with him. He knew that he needed to be more than just a strong warrior as the duchy’s master.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘More so than meeting the emperor… I’ve earned many things on this journey.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven felt that he finally experienced and learned the complexities of the world after living thirty arduous years. He entered a village pub in a complex mood.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The trip to the capital was a valuable experience for Raven as he also discovered his purposes beyond fulfilling his revenge as Raven Valt. He realized his massive responsibilities as Alan Pendragon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It set the cornerstone of the path that Raven was to take. Not as just one person, but as two people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you thinking so hard about, brother?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The pub was fairly unoccupied, perhaps because it was still daytime. Irene spoke while looking at Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm? No, nothing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven became startled and woke up from his deep thoughts.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was still more to come.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though he had learned a lot, he couldn’t judge and make decisions with only a few months’ worth of experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The future was long and the possibilities were endless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, when will I get to see the capital?”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay asked in a cautious voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven was also somewhat curious, so he turned to the person who was most familiar with the imperial castle and the capital, Leon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, you didn’t know? We’re already in the capital.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay’s eyes opened in surprise, and Leon continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, you must have missed the Emperor Wall. We are in a town called Darion, near the south gate of the capital. Five miles from here, you will be able to see the Wall of Glory. Then there are two more walls that are three miles apart. In fact, that is where it is truly considered to be the capital, but technically, we have already passed the division.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“12 miles in a straight line… are you saying all of it is the capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord. And from the Wall of the Lion, which is the innermost wall, it is the imperial castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven was made speechless for a moment at Leon’s vigorous nod and grand answer. To think that the capital included even a half a day’s distance from the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It did seem a little strange that the number of passersby on the road had increased sharply since a while ago.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Johnbolt, then how many people live in the capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon pondered for a moment before answering Irene’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not entirely certain, but if you are considering the population within the Walls of Glory, it is probably over 100,000. And… there are dozens of villages that are similar to here in size within the perimeter, so I think the population might be over 150,000.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, if they considered the small cities that were only a day or two’s distance away from the capital, the population would easily exceed 200,000.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“One hundred…. Fifty thousand…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay and Irene were rather dazzled by the enormous number. It was hard to believe that a single city had a population that exceeded their entire territory’s population by several times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm, then we’d better take a little rest before setting off. If it’s 5 miles, we should be able to pass through the castle gate by the afternoon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord. Then I will go check on the horses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon bowed down and walked out of the pub.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Johnbolt seems very tired, Your Grace. His complexion isn’t very good.”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lindsay spoke anxiously after Leon left. Although his physique and physical strength had improved through the hell training, his face seemed rather dark and gaunt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm, I don’t think it’s entirely because of that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, then…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He must have many worries, now that we are heading back to the imperial castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene and Lindsay nodded at the same time. They had forgotten during the time they spent together with Leon.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon was a member of the imperial jester’s family, and he ran away from home without permission.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even though he may have siblings, it would be hard for him to abandon his family business when all of his family members are jesters.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. But you will help him, right, Brother?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene asked rhetorically, but Raven shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? But Sir Johnbolt is a squire of our duchy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, but that’s the end of it. I took in Leon as a squire of our duchy. It’s up to him to take care of his past. In addition, Leon is an imperial jester. If I ask it as a favor from Prince Ian and the Emperor, they’ll give permission, but it’s unknown how others will react.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Surely they wouldn’t… Not because we took Sir Johnbolt into our duchy…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They surely would. Leon is probably worrying about that as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon’s jester grandfather was knighted by a mischievous accident of the former emperor, and now his grandson became a squire for a duchy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There’s no way that the chatterbox felines of the imperial castle would not pay attention to the matter. In addition, there were figures who weren’t favorable towards the Pendragon Duchy in the imperial castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no better excuse to provoke the Pendragon family and scratch their honor. Especially more since the Pendragon family had been a hot topic that everyone was paying attention to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene and Lindsay observed the door where Leon had exited for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, Argos, who was silently drinking tea in his chair, stood up from his spot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will be right back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Go ahead.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven allowed it without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In Leon’s current situation, Argos would be much more helpful than himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ha…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon gave a long sigh while patting the mane of his horse that was chewing oats.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">By this afternoon, he would be entering the imperial castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It had been half a year since he left home without saying anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The imperial castle was sure to throw a large welcome for the Pendragon Duchy’s next duke and his group. His lord, Lady Irene, and Baroness Conrad may not know, but there wouldn’t be anyone welcoming him.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Especially his family…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His father was a man who was proud of his heritage and family. He wasn’t someone who would easily forgive Leon for running away from home with the family heirloom, especially when he expressed his hate for the family’s legacy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Above all, the bigger problem was not his father, but rather the other humans of the imperial castle.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just as his grandfather had been mocked, it would be his turn to be laughed at.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, he could bear it.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But his true fear was that he thought his lord and Lady Irene, both of whom he respected from the bottom of his heart, would be mocked because of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a member of the Pendragon family, he absolutely wanted to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ve gotten lazy. What did I tell you to do even when you were resting?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leon turned his head in surprise at the voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argos was staring towards Leon. The aftermath of his severed arm was still present, and his complexion looked thinner than when Leon had first seen him.&nbsp;</span></p>
