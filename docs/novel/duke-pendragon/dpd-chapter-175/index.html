 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The dinner proceeded in a calm, quiet manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone from the duchy attended the event dressed in black to commemorate Luna. But the atmosphere of the meal was not dark. Rather, it was just a little calm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason was due to Raven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mia, how was everything in the castle?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The little girl was chewing her food with her chubby cheeks full. She lifted her head instantly with wide eyes when she heard her brother’s voice. Seeing Raven’s smiling face, Mia’s face became slightly colored and she shook her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her eyes headed towards the end of the long table.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the receiving end of her gaze was Kratul, who was gobbling up an entire pig thigh, and Kazzal, who was scrumptiously eating a fish with his small, pointed fangs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did Kratul and Kazzal play with you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mia smiled shyly and nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon seeing her reaction, Kazzal snorted proudly and spoke condescendingly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Handsome Kazzal played with the little Pendragon all the time! Master Pendragon, you may compliment Handsome Kazzal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t have to play with her if you don’t want to. Instead, you can become a dragon’s fo..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The best, best thing in the world is to play with little Pendragon. Handsome Kazzal was born to play with little Pendragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. How about you, Irene? How have you been? It seems you have gotten prettier since I last saw you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heugkh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene had been secretly stealing glances at her brother. Then, when he openly complimented her, she made a strange sound as if the food was stuck in her throat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keuk! Keup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“M, my lady.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The maids that followed from Conrad Castle hurriedly patted Irene’s back. Her face was dyed red from choking. After finally passing the food, Irene took a graceful sip of water as if nothing had happened, then spoke with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh brother… You flatter me. It only seems like that because you have been taking good care of me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrary to her humble words, her smile betrayed her true thoughts. She obviously knew that she was beautiful. Her brazen appearance caused Raven to laugh lightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. I will be happy as long as you keep taking good care of me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene twisted her body shyly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anyone else who saw the scene might think of Irene’s actions as excessive, but everyone here knew that she was just being true to herself. Unfortunately, it also caused a headache for the maids as they seriously pondered how Irene would get married in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, now…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the quiet atmosphere of the meal turned somewhat bright, Raven looked around the table and continued his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know very well how everyone is feeling about what happened to Lady Seyrod.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The atmosphere turned somber at his words. Just today, everyone had seen Lord Seyrod receive Luna’s body. In addition, they saw Raven swear a blood oath in front of her body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will avenge the esteemed daughter of the Seyrod family. As family sharing blood, I will achieve it. I swear on Pendragon's name.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven’s tone was calm, but his voice was determined and powerful. Everyone, especially the women, felt secure and relieved despite their sadness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anyone could be sad, but not anyone could take an oath while containing their sadness. Alan Pendragon was a man who would certainly keep his oaths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven slowly rose from his seat and continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So after today, let us bury Luna Seyrod in our hearts for the time being.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He slowly raised his glass. Everyone followed suit, rising from their seats with their glasses, regardless of race.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Until the day of revenge, when we will be able to miss her once more.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven emptied his glass of red wine and the others followed suit. Then they bowed their heads to pay the last silent tribute to Luna Seyrod. A still moment of respect towards the dead, but it was not as gloomy as before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone looked up again. Their expressions were a little different from when they arrived at dinner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now, everyone, let us sit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mood was not as heavy as before, and all of them returned to their seats with calm faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you may well know, I called everyone to Leus because of safety reasons. I do not want to ever see anything like this happening again. Of course, it would be the safest if we could stay in Conrad Castle with Soldrake and the Ancona Orcs protecting us, but the situation is not allowing for that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone nodded at Raven’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It would be foolish to hole up in the duchy just because it’s dangerous. The threat surrounding me, the duchy, and the entire will not go away by itself. It will never stop. Besides, as a duke of the empire and the governor of Leus, I have great responsibilities.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven spoke towards both the people here and for himself. It wasn’t just Luna’s death that led his thoughts here. Her death served as one of the triggers, but he had realized earlier that he had duties and responsibilities, not as Raven Valt, but as Alan Pendragon, duke of the empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The status makes the man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And his seat was at the heart of this huge empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could not avoid the great responsibilities and hide himself away in a corner of the duchy. He could not do so if he wanted to get revenge for the Valt family and to end the huge conspiracy surrounding the Pendragon family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was destiny.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just because he did not ask for it did not mean he could shrink from his responsibility. Turning one’s eyes did not make the reality disappear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is why I called you all here, to fulfil my responsibilities. You guys are my…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a brief pause, Raven resumed with a rather awkward expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Because everyone here is precious to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…..!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was astonished.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was always cold, and his words were blunt. It was unbelievable that he would say such words. No one could have imagined it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone’s astonishments were expressed in a variety of reactions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brother…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your grace…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene and Lindsay looked at Raven with tears in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But on the other hand, some reacted… differently…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ehem! The great Earth God said to value your comrades… But I feel like my fangs are shriveling up when Pendragon scarecrow says it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kukeut! I know, right? Pendragon scarecrow, don’t tell me you like men or look at orcs with ‘different’ eyes, right? Kukekuet!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Crazy bastards.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven dismissed the unseemly jokes of Karuta and Kratul in two cold words, then continued on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is a shame that the duchess could not come. But just as I am attempting to fulfil my responsibilities, the duchess is doing what she can as the senior member of the Pendragon family. That is why I am respecting her decision.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he recalled the letter Elena sent, a corner of Raven’s heart became a little heavier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her letter contained pride, affection, and concern for her son, who had become the Governor of the City of Leus. It was more than enough to rouse emotions in a man like Raven who had veins of steel and a hardened heart from his years on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The letter also taught him how Elena Pendragon was a great mother and a “true noble” who did not cower from her responsibilities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, brother. That is what mother said. But… I am still a little worried.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although she was wise and mature, Irene was still a young girl. She would be worried sick about leaving Elena behind in Conrad Castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I share your worries. But Argos will not let anyone touch the duchess, so I think we can rest assured.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Argos…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Recalling the old fighter, Irene’s hardened face became a little softer. She had already witnessed the skills of the old fighter called the Black Tiger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Furthermore, his skills were now recognized by everyone in Conrad Castle as well. A couple months ago, some knights of Conrad Castle challenged Argos after hearing that the duke had recruited him personally. They had looked down on him because of his small stature and the absence of one arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But all of them were scattered across the floor in an instant, and since then, they treated Argos with extreme care, calling him “Old Master”.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Besides, there was another reason they had to show respect.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The general of the castle, Melborn, was of similar age to Argos and treated the old fighter politely. They soon became good friends, and so everyone had no choice but to show respect.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Above all, there are many outstanding knights in the duchy including Sir Killian and Sir Ron. They will be able to protect the duchess and the duchy without trouble. I believe in them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, brother.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Irene nodded vigorously with a convinced expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The atmosphere improved afterwards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not a pleasant and exciting mood, but compared to just a few hours ago, everyone’s expressions had loosened several notches. In its comfort, people looked at the person responsible for turning the mood upside down in a short instant. Their eyes glimmered with a renewed look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The eyes of Raven, which had always been sprinkled with ice-cold light, had changed to resemble a river that was calmly, but proudly flowing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His arrogant and cold expression had also changed to a calm, tranquil expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But his posture remained the same. It seemed like he would never stumble, just like a sturdy tree with its roots deep in the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In just half a year, the coldest man in the Pendragon Duchy had undergone a complete change.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…This is a port city, so you will be able to see all sorts of different races, just like Kratul and Kazzal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The people of the duchy shared a gaze as they saw Raven stroke Mia’s head with a faint smile. Everyone expected him to be in shock and anger over the assassination attempt and the death of Luna.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But their brother, husband, and lord – he had overcome it alone. Not only that, he was trying to fulfil the responsibilities he was tasked with while taking care of his people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Raven speak softly to Mia, Irene suddenly remembered a sad, nostalgic memory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Father…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a child, she had received a similar kind of love from her father, Duke Gordon Pendragon. After more than a decade, Irene Pendragon saw the image of her father once more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The harmonious reunion was finally over.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The governor’s residence was very large and spacious, but Raven let Irene and Mia share a room, and had the maids stay in the next room which had a passage connecting the two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He also asked Karuta, who had been digging a hole in the yard with the orcs, to stay in the room right next to the stairs, and he gave the room on the other side to Isla.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the best way to protect his two younger sisters. In fact, Raven had tried to keep Irene and Mia with ‘her’ in the same room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But including Irene, everyone voiced that it would be the safest for ‘her’ to stay in the same room with the strongest person in the residence. Even Isla, who rarely voiced his opinion, agreed as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most of all, they were unyielding in that Raven needed to fulfil his responsibilities as the Duke of Pendragon, as Raven himself mentioned at the dinner table. To fulfil his ‘responsibilities’, there would be nothing more suitable than having ‘her’ stay with him…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So in the end, he was half-forced into staying with ‘her’ in the same room. He would share a room with Lindsay Conrad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, my lord. As a knight of the Pendragon Duchy, I will fulfil my responsibilities and take care of the security of the residence. So the lord, as the master of Pendragon, must take responsibility with your iron will and…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I got it, so stop it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raven shut the door, cutting off the words of Isla. He could swear that Isla spoke with ulterior motives.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a light sigh, he turned around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The room was filled with elegant and colorful furniture, but it felt empty until yesterday. But now, he could feel the warmth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The warmth was radiating from Lindsay Conrad, who was sitting carefully with flustered cheeks.</span></p>
