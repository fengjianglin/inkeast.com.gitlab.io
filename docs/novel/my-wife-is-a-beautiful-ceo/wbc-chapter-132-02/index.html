 <p>During the day, work remained very relaxed. Other than teasing the other pretty girls and making perverted jokes, all he did was play games. However, ever since Yang Chen learned to play Warcraft and got to know Yuanye, the games he played weren’t just Concentration.</p>
 <p>Yuanye was unexpectedly passionate, he practically contacted Yang Chen to battle with him online everyday.</p>
 <p>Due to his innate advantage, it was very easy for Yang Chen to beat Yuanye. However, to make the game fun, Yang Chen frequently used some cheese strategies which had loopholes. While making the game more fun, it gave Yuanye more opportunities to win.</p>
 <p>Yuanye truly admired Yang Chen’s skill, he thought of the words Yang Chen gave to him as guidance in the past, along with Yang Chen’s unordinary battle prowess. These truly made him want to be friends with Yang Chen. There was no lack of rich scoundrelly kids around him, but when it came to true friends, he had too few.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen also gradually felt that Yuanye wasn’t a troublemaking Young Master like in some other rich families. Yuanye may do some silly things, but at least he was more pleasing to the eye. Since Yuanye showed such an amicable attitude, he accepted Yuanye as a friend, and the two gradually became close.</p>
 <p>When it was about time to knock off work on Friday, Yang Chen had just finished the last game of the day with Yuanye.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen was about to bid farewell on MSN when Yuanye sent him a message.</p>
 <p>“Yang-ge, the 9th of the next month is my birthday, I’d like to invite you to my home for the party."</p>
 <p>Yang Chen hesitated, from what he currently knew, Yuanye’s background was definitely one of the ultra-rich. Although he wouldn’t feel pressured from a family background like this, he may end up bumping into ignorant people, a confrontation arising would be bad.</p>
 <p>Yuanye seemed to understand Yang Chen’s worry, so he sent another message, “Don’t worry Yang-ge, I’m just inviting some close friends and a few of my family members, there aren’t any of those kind of people that you detest.”</p>
 <p>Since he put it that way, it wasn’t good for Yang Chen to reject him, so Yang Chen agreed and cheerfully said goodbye to Yuanye.</p>
 <p>Just as Yang Chen turned off the computer and was about to leave the office, Zhao Hongyan who sat closest to him suddenly asked him, “Yang Chen, do you have any plans after work?”</p>
 <p>“Nope, what’s up?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Hongyan said with a smile, “Everybody has been busy since Mingyu-jie’s promotion, and we haven’t celebrated for her. Tonight, Zhang Cai and I made plans to go to Blueberry Bar to celebrate for Mingyu-jie, and we want to invite you to come with us. After all, we’re a group of women and it’ll be boring without a man. Furthermore, it’ll be safer with a man around in a place like a bar.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Yang Chen remember that they hadn’t celebrated Liu Mingyu’s promotion. Seeing the imploring gaze of the surrounding pretty girls, he found it difficult to reject, so he straightforwardly agreed to it.</p>
 <p>After making a phone call home to Wang Ma, Yang Chen saw Liu Mingyu walk out of her office in off-work clothes. She had mild makeup, let her tied hair down, a tight blue V-neck T-shirt with a white shirt on the outside. Looking delicate and graceful, her mature charm was dazzling.</p>
 <p>Noticing Yang Chen staring at her, Liu Mingyu felt slightly contented and asked, “Do I look nice?”</p>
 <p>“Department Head Liu deserves to be called the number one beauty in the PR Department.” Yang Chen earnestly said.</p>
 <p>“Stop calling me Department Head after working hours, it sounds so unpleasant.” Liu Mingyu rolled her eyes at him, and walked out shoulder to shoulder with the other sisters in laughter.</p>
 <p>Blueberry Bar was considered one of the famous bars in Zhonghai. Due to its rather elegant decorations and reasonable pricing, it was very popular amongst the white collars in the city.</p>
 <p>This was Yang Chen’s first time coming, he followed behind seven female colleagues, and was eyed with envy, jealousy, and hatred by other men because these female colleagues were all exceptional beauties. They were dressed up and all looked pretty in their own right, there were some who were youthful and lively, and some who were mature and graceful. How could they not cause the eyes of this bunch of wolves to light up?</p>
 <p>After they sat down on a sofa in the corner of the bar, they ordered over a dozen bottles of alcohol without any fear of getting drunk. The women took off their coats and began to choose their favorite drinks, they didn’t appear lady-like at all.</p>
 <p>It’s said that three women were enough for a drama, when seven women are together, there’d naturally be unending chatter. They drank alcohol, ate fruits, and very soon their faces turned bright red with beauty that couldn’t be manufactured.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen held onto a bottle of vodka and sipped on it. Ever since he lost control of his mind, he didn’t dare to drink too much alcohol. After all, it would affect his consciousness, Yang Chen didn’t dare to play around with it.</p>
 <p>While the women were chattering in laughter, a young man with a handsome face who wore a tight collared shirt and had ear studs walked to the table. He spoke to Zhao Hongyan who was beside Yang Chen, “Sister-in-law, what a coincidence.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Hongyan who was in the midst of laughing froze. She looked at the man and said in an unnatural manner, “Oh, Little Hui. Yeah, what a coincidence… are you also drinking here?”</p>
 <p>“I accompanied my girlfriend here, she drank too much and went to the restroom, she may take a while. Otherwise, I wouldn’t dare to come greet you, sister-in-law, as my girlfriend would get jealous.” The man smiled with a naughty charm.</p>
 <p>Next, the misty-eyed Zhang Cai pouted and asked, “Hongyan, who’s this?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Hongyan awkwardly introduced, “This is my husband’s younger brother, my brother-in-law, his name is Yu Hui.”</p>
 <p>After Yu Hui warmly greeted the ladies, he asked Zhao Hongyan, “Sister-in-law, did you tell my brother that you came out to drink tonight?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Hongyan’s pretty face paled. Pursing her lips, she forced a smile and said, “I seem to have forgotten to make a phone call. Luckily, you reminded me, I’ll go call him now.” As she said that, Zhao Hongyan squeezed out of the sofa and quickly walked out of Blueberry Bar.</p>
 <p>Yu Hui had a slightly grim smile which lasted only for a short moment. After he greeted them again he followed Zhao Hongyan out of the bar.</p>
 <p>Liu Mingyu and the others were rather dazed from drinking, at this moment they looked at each other in dismay but didn’t think much of it. They thought of what happened as just a small misunderstanding.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen snorted to himself, put down the bottle of alcohol and said to the others, “I’m going out to get some air, it feels rather stuffy here. You guys carry on drinking.”</p>
