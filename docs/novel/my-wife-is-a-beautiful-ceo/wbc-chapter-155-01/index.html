 <p>Five minutes later, while following Li Muhua’s black BMW, they entered Jinzewan’s pier. In the vast pier, there were containers and parked trucks scattered all over.</p>
 <p>The two quietly hid somewhere dozens of meters away from the warehouse. They then watched as Li Muhua opened the steel door to the Warehouse 3 and enter it.</p>
 <p>“Are we also going in?” Mo Qianni softly asked.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen didn’t reply, he just grabbed onto one of her arms, then calmly walked over to the side door of the warehouse, where there was an outdoor staircase that directly allowed one to get to the 2nd floor.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After Li Muhua entered Warehouse 3, he glanced at what was in front. There were several batches of goods placed in the area. They were all discarded goods that weren’t shipped out of the pier, and was temporarily left here. When the pier resumes business in a few days, they will naturally be removed.</p>
 <p>The whole warehouse had a humid and chilly wind, it seemed to be quiet without another soul around.</p>
 <p>Li Muhua let go of the two suitcases he was dragging along, then looked at his surroundings and shouted, “I am Muyun’s Li Muhua, I have brought the money.”</p>
 <p>After this shout, the entire warehouse resonated with echoes which continued for a while.</p>
 <p>Right when Li Muhua creased his brows and wondered whether there was anyone else present, four figures walked out from an area behind a pile of goods.</p>
 <p>The man leading them wore a flowery shirt with a windbreaker on the outside, it was a nondescript style. He had a cigar in his mouth, and walked on a pair of black leather flip flops. He stared at Li Muhua with squinted eyes that seemed full of interest.</p>
 <p>Li Muhua saw this person and was immediately shocked, his face turned pale, then flushed, “How… how can it… be……”</p>
 <p>The one who walked out was no other than Li Muhua’s elder brother, Li Mucheng.</p>
 <p>The one who stood by Li Mucheng’s side was was someone who was deeply trusted by the Li Family, who was also the bodyguard and secretary Li Deshen assigned to him, Li Meng.</p>
 <p>The other two bodyguards who wore black clothes and sunglasses were evidently bodyguards from Li Mucheng’s side.</p>
 <p>“Why? Are you very surprised? My dear younger brother.” A sharp glare shot out from Li Mucheng’s eyes, he gripped onto the cigar with two fingers as he coldly asked.</p>
 <p>Li Muhua staggered two steps back, his eyes showed that he was unresigned, in disbelief and in pain as he asked, “Ge, why did you do such a thing?”</p>
 <p>“Why? Haha. Li Muhua, things have already progressed to this stage, yet you still ask me why?” Li Mucheng released a crazed laugh, and suddenly threw the cigar in front of Li Muhua, he roared, “Stop fucking pretending like you’re righteous, I have tolerated this hypocritical face of yours enough, do you think I am as foolish and retarded like that old man who thinks that you’re a good son?”</p>
 <p>Li Muhua was speechless, as if he didn’t know what Li Mucheng was talking about, he blankly stared at him.</p>
 <p>Li Mucheng raised his head, laughed and said, “You’re still pretending? I don’t mind, you can keep pretending. After all, when tonight ends you will no longer be a part of this world, but don’t you worry, I’ll take care of the family’s company and properties for you.”</p>
 <p>“Ge, could it be that you did it all for the company and the properties?” Li Muhua looked at him with disbelief, “I have never thought of hogging the family’s properties to myself, I have always urged Father to give you a chance to participate in the company. Furthermore, ever since I took control of the company, I have never forgotten to give you bonuses every year. Why must you deceive Father and I using an extortion like this, and even use a bomb threat to lure me here?”</p>
