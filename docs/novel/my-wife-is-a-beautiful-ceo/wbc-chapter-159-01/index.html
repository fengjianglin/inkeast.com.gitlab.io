 <p>Chapter 159-1:&nbsp;Left hand</p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light of dawn scattered into the beautiful old-fashioned guest room. On the intricately carved bed and under the thin quilt, Mo Qianni’s head rested on a soft and white pillow, releasing soft breathing sounds in her sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her exquisite facial features were illuminated under the gentle sunlight, with graceful lines seemingly otherworldly, like a sleeping concubine of the emperor, revealing a sexy yet indolent aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the room’s door was pushed open slightly. Yang Chen who had changed into a black suit and maroon tie carried piping hot breakfast in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen placed the congee and the side dishes onto the bedside cabinet, then stood up to look at the woman who still had her eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a helpless smile he said, “Hey, we have proper business to do today, are you planning to stay asleep all day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni’s long eyelashes trembled and her face blushed. Finally unable to endure Yang Chen’s direct gaze, she opened her eyes and quietly sat up on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You knew I was awake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The moment I entered, your body clearly trembled, your skill at feigning sleep isn’t good enough.” Yang Chen teased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m… I’m sorry… I……” Mo Qianni lowered her eyes, she didn’t know what else to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen indifferently said, “Don’t blame yourself, any regular person who saw last night’s scene wouldn’t be able to take it either, and would develop fear. If you don’t feel a single thing, I would instead suspect that you’re a female devil or a homicidal maniac or something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yesterday… what happened after I fainted?” Mo Qianni softly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she watched Yang Chen kill a person, Mo Qianni fainted. She didn’t even know how she returned to the villa. After waking up, she had been in a panicked state. Other than the deadly mysterious attraction this man gave her, she also felt afraid…… So when Yang Chen entered, she didn’t dare to open her eyes immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen pulled over a chair, sat down, and crossed his legs. He spoke in detail, “After negotiating with Li Muhua, he agreed to exchange forty percent of Muyun’s share in this collaboration for his life. Which means that alongside our initial twenty-five percent, Yu Lei will receive sixty-five percent of the total profits from this project.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Mo Qianni raised her head in shock, disbelief was written all over her pretty face, “Sixty-five percent? Isn’t that… this number is too……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was aware of the economic benefits this project might bring, if this was really the case, Yu Lei’s future growth would be unprecedentedly high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this good? At least Junior Li’s feeble life remained.” Yang Chen said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni looked at Yang Chen with a complex expression, for this man always did things that shocked people. Like she was mustering all of her courage, she asked, “Then… what about the others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mean the other two bodyguards?” Yang Chen indifferently said, “They’re dead. Their existence would only be a hindrance. Furthermore, the matter of Li Muhua personally shooting Li Mucheng yesterday was reported to the police as Li Mucheng being the mastermind, while Li Muhua killed him in self-defense. A large sum of the Hong Kong Police’s pay comes from the Li Family, so this matter just needs to go through official procedures for show. As for the two of us, we were never there, so you can be relieved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni maintained silence for a moment, then anxiously asked, “Aren’t you afraid that Li Muhua would go back on his promise after you’ve treated him like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen showed her a relaxed smile, “I am confident in myself, and I’m also confident in Li Muhua’s rationality. He should be very clear of how things would end if he goes back on his promise. He can’t beat me, so he would definitely choose to suffer losses so as to avoid calamity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni forced a smile, “You always give people the feeling that you have ignorant confidence, yet you’re right every time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s the charisma of a man.” Yang Chen winked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, the two didn’t have much to talk about, as Yang Chen didn’t want to explain anything, while Mo Qianni’s mind was in a chaotic state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Yang Chen noticed the suffering and struggle in Mo Qianni. He understandingly sighed, “You don’t need to force yourself, nothing actually happened between the two of us. You don’t have any responsibility in trying all kinds of ways to absolve what happened yesterday. As you have seen, I’m a person who’s proficient in killing, and when I kill someone, I don’t even bat an eyelid. I will not explain to you why I know how to kill, I will not tell you about what I used to do either. All I will tell you is, everything you saw was real, I have things I don’t want to tell you, but I have never covered up the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni looked up into Yang Chen’s calm eyes. She suddenly felt that the man who was sitting right beside her began to distance himself away from her again. The intimacy that was built up yesterday had vanished……</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt a sharp pain in her heart, this was more painful than killing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed so natural, so free, and smiled so casually, as if nothing really mattered…… However, Mo Qianni felt a deep loneliness in him, there was a negative energy which was deep inside him, like a poison that gave constant torment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Chen… will you stretch out your left hand please……” Mo Qianni pursed her rosy lips&nbsp;and softly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen was confused, but he didn’t hesitate and stretched out his left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni reached out her soft hands, and slowly held Yang Chen’s hands in them, her delicate fingers massaged on his slightly coarse skin, scratching and rubbing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last night, you used this hand to take away Li Meng……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen was speechless. That’s right, last night, he used this hand to take away Li Meng’s life, he grabbed Li Meng’s esophagus and pulled it out…… In the past years, this hand had been stained by fresh blood, that stench of blood had soaked deeply into his bones. Sometimes, it even made Yang Chen feel like his hands had already been soaked scarlet.</span></p>
