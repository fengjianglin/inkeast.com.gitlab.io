 <p><span style>“Flaw?” A great deal of suspicion showed in Li Muhua’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Li Meng and the other two bodyguards became rather impatient, Li Meng urged, “Young Master, this fellow’s brain functions faster than a car, we should kill him off quickly and feed him to the fishes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.” Li Muhua said, “I’m very interested to find out what the flaw Mr. Yang mentioned is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The flaw that I mentioned could also be called an unreasonable matter.” Yang Chen pondered, then said, “After we received the phone call from the so-called criminal, there was less than ten minutes before Li Mucheng ran out of his room with knowledge of the biochemical bomb planted by the criminals. If he was really just a useless person that only knew how to make a ruckus and have fun, how could he have known of such a classified matter, and who would tell this to him? Even amongst the villa’s executives, only a few of them knew of this. In order to avoid panic, they also sealed all information to others, who would be so bored as to tell the useless Li Mucheng all of this? Furthermore, who would make such a prompt report without thinking about his uncontrollable mouth that could incite problems?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This was indeed unreasonable, but this is exactly why Mr. Yang should suspect my brother instead of me, right?” Li Muhua asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just the opposite.” Yang Chen smiled, “It’s such an obvious flaw that even I, an outsider, noticed it and pondered over it. Yet as someone of the Li Family, you didn’t have any suspicions, and was so confident that everything was caused by the Xu Family. This made me puzzled, since you’re the most outstanding successor of the Li Family and Muyun’s CEO, how could you be more stupid than that brother of yours who played the fool?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, there’s an explanation for everything. You were also pretending to be a fool, but in a different manner. You were playing the cultured fool. You were polite and amiable to anyone on the surface, respectful and loving to your brother, and filial to your father. However, is this not another form of disguise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Muhua was finally convinced, this series of analysis had made a lot of sense. There may not have been any substantial evidence, but once one thought about it in this way, he truly had way too many flaws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this man who found and linked such clues to unravel a plot he made a long time ago was truly inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni was also excited to hear what Yang Chen said as she had been present throughout all these events. Though she had no suspicions about them previously, she didn’t think that she was stupid, she just pinned it on Yang Chen’s perception being too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Yang Chen had a side like this to him made Mo Qianni joyful, but the two of them seemed to have already reached the end of their lives in their current situation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh well, dying together with him doesn’t seem too bad……</span></i><span style> Women were emotional creatures, once this thought entered her mind, she didn’t feel too bitter inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s such a pity, if Mr. Yang could be used by me, perhaps we could have become good friends.” Li Muhua regretfully said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it.” Yang Chen waved his hand, “You are someone who dared to kill his own brother, I don’t dare to be friends with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve said too much then. The two of you are about to leave this world tonight, these words don’t matter at all.” Once Li Muhua thought about how he could get rid of Yang Chen here, he felt a lot more reassured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Muhua turned around. With his back facing Yang Chen and Mo Qianni, he waved at them as if he was bidding them farewell, for eternity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Understanding that Li Muhua had no intention to continue chatting, while keeping the gun raised, a malevolent smile appeared on Li Meng’s face, “Goodbye, Mr. Yang, Miss Mo……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I suggest that you don’t shoot, I don’t want to kill in front of a woman.” Yang Chen was rather displeased, if Mo Qianni wasn’t by his side, he would’ve already torn apart this fellow who pointed a gun at him by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moron, do you think I am someone who gets scared of big words?” Li Meng said with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With those words spoken, Li Meng unhesitantly pulled the trigger…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>*Bang!*</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gunshot sound was made again, but this time no one fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Meng’s eyes instantly widened, and he slowly lowered his head in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown when it happened, but Yang Chen had moved right in front of Li Meng and was clutching his neck like a steel clamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen’s eyes were like the darkest zones of deathly stillness, it provided no hope for survival, like it was all-seeing and without focus……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will only tell you this, I don’t scare people, I only kill people……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Yang Chen’s low voice was heard, the hand that gripped Li Meng’s throat suddenly tightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*Crrrack*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Meng simply didn’t have any opportunity to resist; Yang Chen’s fingers forcibly pierced through his frail throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen made a pulling motion with a lot of strength, and an indistinct organ was ripped out of Li Meng’s throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni couldn’t endure watching such a bloody scene, and she fainted onto the ground after that scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Muhua and the other bodyguards who had intended to leave suddenly turned around. They saw Li Meng’s blood spurting out from his arteries, and watched his corpse fall onto the ground with his eyes wide open from unresigned anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he had just done something inconsequential, Yang Chen waved his left hand, tossing the esophagus to the ground, but the blood had already dyed half of his body red, and splashed onto his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen raised his head, under his dull eyes was an excited smile…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Li, do you like this type of death? Would you like to try it?”</span></p>
