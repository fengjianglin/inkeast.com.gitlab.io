 <p>Chapter 57: What A Coincidence</p>
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #800080;text-decoration: underline">This chapter is sponsored by the following, Jimmy.V from PA, USA, Zaid.S from Vic, Australia, ????? and Nattarat.R from TH! Much thanks!</span></span></strong></p>
 <p>The ice queen was after all the ice queen. Although she spoke a few sentences for the first time in forever, after those words were spoken she once again returned back to “Shut Down” mode.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen judiciously left the ward. He felt hungry from not eating lunch and drove to a small restaurant to deal with it. He didn’t intend to return to the company and work. Instead, he asked for directions and left for Zhong Hai Yi Zhong to look for Li Jingjing.</p>
 <p>[Note: Zhong Hai Yi Zhong is the name of the school Li Jingjing works at.]</p>
 <p>With regards to that innocent girl, Yang Chen always felt distressed on how to handle the relationship between the two of them, he couldn’t bear to hurt her, and wasn’t willing to see her sad. But in the end, Yang Chen knew that he still hadn’t completely given up on Li Jingjing in his heart.</p>
 <p>Men simply liked to find excuses to make themselves seem righteous……</p>
 <p>In Zhong Hai, Yi Zhong is considered one of the most elite school, so it could easily be found by simply asking the locals for directions.</p>
 <p>After parking the car at the large outdoor car park in the school, Yang Chen got off the car, and realized that he had forgot to set a location for meeting up with Li Jingjing. However, he didn’t panic to make a phone call, since it’s always better to give a pleasant surprise.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was because they saw Yang Chen drive a BMW into the school, the security guards at the entrance didn’t obstruct him, and only glanced before amicably letting him pass.</p>
 <p>Yi Zhong’s campus was fresh to Yang Chen. In fact, Yang Chen had never spent much time in school. The school’s orderly layout, the many wooden plaques of famous sayings, as well as the occasional teachers and students walking past with books, all these were completely fresh in Yang Chen’s eyes.</p>
 <p>After asking an elderly teacher along the way, Yang Chen found the building that was the teachers’ office. Recalling that Li Jingjing teaches English, based on that clue, he quickly found the office which had the door with the sign “Li Jingjing” on it. Above it contained a picture of a girl wearing a smile, appearing to be brimming with youth.</p>
 <p>After knocking on the door thrice, the words “please enter” came from the inside. It was precisely the familiar voice of Li Jingjing.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen opened the door, and the first thing he saw was the two seated people. The first was naturally Li Jingjing with a long ponytail tied up, wearing a white short-sleeved blouse, and a pair of mid-length jean shorts that covered her thighs, looking fresh and beautiful.</p>
 <p>The appearance of the other person astonished Yang Chen, it was actually the “Land Rover lady” he met by chance at that night, with hair that was long, sexy and wavy, a black suit that gave off a heavy impression of accomplishment, her smooth and fair feet stepped on a pair of crystal-like textured silver high heels. Sitting on the chair, her entire figure was like a meticulously sculpted piece of art.</p>
 <p>The two ladies that had completely opposite styles yet were equally enchanting sat opposite of each other, and turned their heads to look at Yang Chen who was at the door at the same time. However, the expressions they revealed were completely different.</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing’s delight was displayed through her words as she stood up and called out “big brother Yang.” She happily moved up and pulled Yang Chen into the office, and moved a chair for him to sit, “Why have you come so suddenly yet didn’t give me a call?”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen awkwardly laughed, and said, “A surprise, surprises are better.” Then, he looked towards the lady that had an expression of enlightenment, “What a coincidence, we meet again.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah.” Tang Wan sized Yang Chen up, then looked at the contented Li Jingjing, and a weird yet ambiguous smile appeared on her face, “So you are acquainted with Teacher Li?”</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing curiously asked, “Miss Tang knows big brother Yang?”</p>
 <p>“One fateful encounter.” Said Tang Wan, and she added-on, “Not familiar.”</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing didn’t think much of it, and nodded, “I never thought big brother Yang would come so suddenly, but since everybody is acquainted then it’s fine. Please tell me if there’s anything Miss Tang still wishes to know, or need me to help with.”</p>
 <p>Tang Wan shook her head with a smile and said, “I have already disturbed Teacher Li by chatting for a long time, it’s about time I returned to my office. Moreover, since Mr Yang is already here, if I still insist on staying, that would be too inconsiderate of me.” As she said that, she gave Yang Chen a profound look.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen wouldn’t dare look at this lady face to face. At that time, he made it clear that he wanted her to be his one night stand. The tragedy was that he failed, and now they met when he came to look for Li Jingjing, so it couldn't be helped that her thoughts drifted in that direction. As a result, he glanced all around the room, refusing to chat more with Tang Wan.</p>
 <p>These words made Li Jingjing blush, but she felt sweetness in her heart, “Miss Tang is overthinking things, we are not in that kind of relationship.”</p>
 <p>“Then let’s leave it as me overthinking things.” Tang Wan didn’t bluntly point out anything. She gracefully stood up and picked up her white Chanel handbag, “I would have to trouble Teacher Li with taking care of my daughter in the future. I shall take my leave now, thank you Teacher Li.”</p>
 <p>“You’re too courteous, goodbye Miss Tang.”</p>
 <p>After seeing Tang Wan off, Yang Chen breathed a sigh of relief, thinking of the conversation before, he bafflingly asked, “Jingjing, that Miss Tang asked you to take care of her daughter?”</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing nodded, smiling she said, “Yes, Miss Tang’s daughter is in my class, and I am the new form teacher, so she came to chat with me regarding her daughter. Actually her daughter is pretty intelligent, and obtains good results. However, she is just too naughty, her previous form teachers were all rather worried, and made her change classes quite a number of times. Miss Tang was afraid that I would do the same, so she specially came to chat with me for a long time.”</p>
 <p>“Oh……” Yang Chen was a little shocked inside, he never thought that Tang Wan was someone who had a daughter because she looked so young. Since she was a mother, it’s no wonder he didn’t succeed that night.</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing had no idea her “great big brother” had such thoughts, and continued saying, “I pity all the parents of the world, I think that educating children always require some patience. I plan to make some time to chat with that child. I feel that an intelligent girl like her would definitely understand her parents’ labors.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen nodded in approval, “That’s true, a person like me that never had a mother or father can’t endure the fact that someone is not contented despite having a mother’s love.”</p>
 <p>“Big brother Yang, you’re not allowed to bring up this matter, it makes people sad.” Li Jingjing consoled.</p>
 <p>“I, your big brother Yang, have been used to it long ago.” Yang Chen laughed, and stood up from the chair. He looked around at the refined office, “This truly deserves to be called an elite school, even the offices are so delightful.”</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing felt cheerful hearing the praises, smiled and said, “This office is only used by me and another female teacher, sometimes I feel that it’s quite a waste.”</p>
 <p>“My family’s little sister Li Jingjing has braved the cold for years, it’s no big deal for her to use an office like this.” Yang Chen teasingly said.</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing pouted and said, “Big brother Yang, I’m not little anymore…… And also not some little sister…… According to age, I’m even the same age as you……”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen was stunned, and saw Li Jingjing’s pair of large innocent eyes staring at him. In his heart, he knew what this girl was thinking about, and he felt ashamed about it, but he didn’t know what to say.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the office telephone rang.</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing glanced at Yang Chen with bitterness once more, and proceeded to pick up the phone. After listening on the phone, she said, “Thank you, I got it.” Before hanging up.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on? Did something happen?” Asked Yang Chen who immediately shifted from earlier’s topic.</p>
 <p>Li Jingjing pursed her little lips bashfully, and looked at Yang Chen with anticipation, “Big brother Yang, can you accompany me to somewhere tonight?”</p>
