 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Song Tianxing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen who just retracted his hand from Yun Miao’s back had no idea what she was saying with such emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t feign ignorance! The internal method you used to treat me was obviously our Shushan’s Endless Resolve Restoration Scripture, the only inheritor of this technique left is Song Tianxing! You’re using genuine internal energy from the Endless Resolve Restoration Scripture, how could you have no relationship with Song Tianxing!? Quickly tell me! Where has that bastard Song Tianxing gone!?” Abbess Yun Miao yelled quickly, causing the others to be stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen’s brows creased slightly, he gradually understood what Abbess Yun Miao meant, but he also began to find many things strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hui Lin curiously blinked and asked, “Master, are you referring to Song Tianxing, Senior Uncle Song?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.” Yun Miao stared at Yang Chen and said, “No wonder I had such a bad reaction to his appearance, so it was because of the Endless Resolve Restoration Scripture’s internal energy, how could I forget that aura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen pondered for a bit, then said, “Abbess, regardless of whether you believe me or not, I myself didn’t know that this martial art is called Endless Resolve Restoration Scripture, I also don’t know that it came from Shushan. However, I might be able to tell you some things you want to know about this Song Tianxing person you mentioned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears began to surface in Abbess Yun Miao’s eyes, “Really? Quickly tell me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen looked at his surroundings, then said to Sky Dragon, Leaf, and the others, “All of you leave for a while, this conversation has contents that isn’t for others to know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bleh, what’s the big deal, we’re also very curious.” Sky Dragon wanted to listen in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Dragon, get out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abbess Yun Miao coldly swept a glance at them, and even the thick-skinned Sky Dragon gave up after mumbling a little. They all left Coiling Dragon Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the temple, there was only Yang Chen, Yun Miao, and Hui Lin left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You may speak now.” Abbess Yun Miao was extremely eager and was looking forward to hear from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen nodded, after arranging his thoughts he said, “This matter goes back to Zero. I believe you should know about Zero, Abbess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Miao frowned, “Zero? Of course I know about them, they used to be the world’s best assassin organization, but I heard that they were single handedly destroyed by you. I never believed it, but when I saw you fight in my dazed state, I now believe you have that ability. Your battle prowess is no longer something ordinary humans can achieve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen bitterly smiled, “Actually, not many people know that I used to work for Zero. In fact, in my first memory, I was already living in Zero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Yun Miao doubtfully asked, “Then why……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You need not ask about that further, Abbess. I can tell you that Song Tianxing who you’re looking for was also in Zero, I was about eight years old back then when I coincidentally bumped into him. I didn’t know his name, and he should have been someone important within the organization. I remember that he was very curious as to why there was a boy from Huaxia within the organization. Then, he decided to teach me this kung fu, which is also the Endless Resolve Restoration Scripture you mentioned. Back then, I didn’t know what it was, I just practised it, and noticed that my body would recover quickly if I cultivated in the way he taught.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up till here, Yang Chen had a nostalgic look in his eyes. He remembered the image of that sloppy looking middle-aged man smirking at him with a liquor bottle in hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Afterwards, when I was ten, I went through an experiment with many children from other countries. The other children all died, and I was the only one who survived. At that time, I understood that this skill definitely wasn’t just for improving my body’s recovery speeds. Until now, I’m still grateful towards that man. I only learned today that his name is Song Tianxing, how ironic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abbess Yun Miao forced a smile, “The Endless Resolve Restoration Scripture is something genius born out of a senior from Shushan who took a wrong step in cultivation, became possessed by the devil, and became extremely bloodthirsty. It was created when he turned over a new leaf. It doesn’t just help the body recover quicker, the important part of it is that it helps with curbing with one’s mental demons. Borrowing the yin and yang of heaven and earth, and deriving from the natural laws of everything, it can allow a person to naturally improve their strength. However, it is difficult to learn and understand, and requires an innate talent for perception. Those who could successfully master it are one in a million. Senior Brother Song must have noticed your talent by a coincidence and chose to impart it to you. Otherwise, this skill would truly be lost forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like this……” A light bulb lit up in Yang Chen’s mind. It’s no wonder that I could use this internal method to suppress my violent tendencies, I wonder if Song Tianxing predicted this or did it unintentionally, but this skill that he imparted to me was what carried me through many crises, and also helped me to escape from a life of slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, your internal energy is extremely robust, what level have you cultivated up to?” Abbess Yun Miao caringly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The eighth stage, but it has already been five years. I’m still far from reaching the ninth stage no matter what I do though.” Yang Chen helplessly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!? The eighth level!?” Abbess Yun Miao sized Yang Chen up like she was looking at a monster, “There are only a total of nine stages, even Senior Brother Song was only able to reach the seventh stage and couldn’t break through any further for so many years. You… you’re actually able to reach the eighth stage at such a young age!? It’s no wonder you look absolutely fine despite expending so much True Qi to treat me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen laughed, “I have no choice, if I didn’t cultivate faster, I’d be in big trouble.”</span></p>
