 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Yang Chen said that, there seemed to be an undetectable cyclone forming in the temple, causing the dust to rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen’s pair of brown eyes gradually turned blood red, and his mouth formed a reserved grin. He swept a glance at the seven people remaining with a strange look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A feeling that made one’s heart stop permeated all over the temple. Everybody were feeling overwhelmed with fear, as if the man in the center of the temple had become a dark, terrifying abyss that could swallow all of their souls without leaving anything behind!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Storm’s four members and Dan Zeng’s three slowly closed in, ready to receive Yang Chen’s sudden attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Yang…… He……” Leaf felt like she couldn’t recognize Yang Chen anymore, because Yang Chen’s currently gave off a completely different aura, as if he had become a different person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tsunami pulled Leaf back, and they took a few steps backwards, “Leaf, stay away, he’s very dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sky Dragon and the others retreated to the entrance of temple with apprehension, they looked at Yang Chen who was enveloped in black smog, and exchanged glances with each other. They all saw fear in each others’ eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do I feel like he’s using some kind of internal method?” Sky Dragon hesitantly whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is too terrifying, he has no True Qi exposed at all, yet he is so mighty, could this be the Xiantian Stage?” Bigfoot said with widened eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiantian!? That can’t be! When Wudang Sect’s Taoist Seven Absolute passed away sixteen years ago, there was no longer any Xiantian Stage experts left in Huaxia, unless we’re witnessing one in action today!?” Squall found this inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hui Lin who carried Abbess Yun Miao wiped away her teary eyes, and murmured, “I find this feeling familiar……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Familiar?” Sky Dragon and the others wouldn’t believe that Hui Lin was talking drivel. After careful reflection, he said, “Indeed, it does seem to have a slight similarity to the Shushan Swordplay that Abbess Yun Miao and Miss Hui Lin uses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But the murderous air he gives off is so much fiercer than the Sword Qi from Shushan Swordplay. Furthermore, whether it’s Abbess Yun Miao or the masters in Shaolin, there doesn’t seem to be any who has internal energy as profound as his.” Sky Dragon was deep in thought. Although he had stellar talent, he could feel the disparity in power between Yang Chen and him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tsunami was also deep in thought, “No matter how powerful he is, at least he is currently a friend and not a foe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike the others from the Yellow Flame Iron Brigade, the seven on the opposing side had ugly expressions, but they had bigger problems because nobody of the seven dared to initiate on Yang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amitabha.” High Lama Dan Zeng’s wrinkles seemed to have deepened, “In all of my life, I’ve never seen such ruthless murderous intent. Thick like ink, cold like ice, like an asura from hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dan Zeng, don’t say things that we don’t understand, if you want to attack then quickly do it!” Punk loudly berated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dharmaraja, Great Compassion angrily replied, “Then why don’t you guys initiate? Our high lama is a reincarnated living buddha, how could he take such risks!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monk, are you trying to pick a fight with us!?” Carlos yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the two parties could continue arguing, Yang Chen who had been waiting for them was getting impatient. He sighed, “Since neither party wants to make a move, then let me. Although dealing with you guys one by one takes a little more time, it’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pluto, don’t keep showing us movie special effects, we’re better than you at this!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Andy who finally couldn’t handle the pressure decided to make his move. He opened one hand, and took out a sharp military knife with the other. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The density of the air around Yang Chen abruptly decreased, a strong and formless pressure engulfed him. The clothes he wore began to press down on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Yang Chen staying in the same spot, Andy thought that Yang Chen was unable to move due to his supernatural ability. He charged forward with a malicious smile, with his knife pointed at Yang Chen’s throat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen smiled with contempt, “Moron.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hand that was neither fast or slow moved to stop the knife. The military knife came into contact with his palm, and a series of metal cracking sounds were heard. The military knife was shattered repeatedly and only stopped at the knife’s hilt!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this f**king hell!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Andy exclaimed in terror, for the hand he wielded the knife with had been caught by Yang Chen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is earth, but you’re going to hell very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen’s apathetic statement was followed up with the same hand that he grabbed Andy’s arm, and it moved up the arm. His hand shot forwards, like a hot knife stabbing a block of butter……</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that block of butter was precisely Andy’s chest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two ladies, Hui Lin and Leaf who weren’t far from them shut their eyes and turned away, they couldn’t believe the bloody scene that just witnessed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Yang Chen’s hand had simply tore through a sheet of paper when he penetrated Andy’s sturdy body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Andy himself wasn’t able to react in time at all when Yang Chen’s hand tore through the back of his clothes, then he pulled out a mangled bloody lump with some bits of his clothes on it. He looked down and saw his beating heart. Next, he opened his mouth, but he had no voice, and he unwillingly exhaled……</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Andy fell onto the floor with a bang, Yang Chen casually threw Andy’s heart to the area under the Buddha statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight of this bloody mess was a stark contrast from the peaceful image of the statue.</span></p>
