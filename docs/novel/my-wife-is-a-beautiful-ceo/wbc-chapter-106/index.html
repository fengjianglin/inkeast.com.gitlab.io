 <p><strong>My Wife is a Beautiful CEO</strong></p>
 <p>Chapter 106: What a sham</p>
 <p>In a blink of an eye, the weekend came again, it had been two weeks since Lin Ruoxi was hospitalized. Yang Chen lamented the passing of time because he had to pick Lin Ruoxi up from the hospital tomorrow..</p>
 <p>Early in the morning, Wang Ma had prepared a sumptuous breakfast. She knew that Yang Chen had a big appetite, so she was used to preparing an extra portion of every dish. She even turned on the TV beforehand and changed it to the new channel for him. She was incredibly thoughtful.</p>
 <p>In the beginning, Yang Chen wasn’t used to this pampering and spoiling treatment, but he realized later on that if he didn’t let Wang Ma do these things, then she’d feel extremely uncomfortable and worried. In the end he still had to let her do what she wanted to do.</p>
 <p>“Young Master, Miss will be returning tomorrow morning. How about you buy some flowers to make the occasion more joyous? I think Miss will like it.” Wang Ma happily suggested.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen gulped down the congee, gnawed on the oat steamed bun, and muttered, “Flowers? Which kind of flowers?”</p>
 <p>“Carnations!” Wang Ma suggested, “But if Young Master buys roses, I think Miss will like them too.”</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t know what carnations meant in the language of flowers, he at least knew what red roses meant. He revealed a smile and said, “Wang Ma, with Ruoxi’s personality, even if I bought her a bouquet of flowers, I reckon that she’d just think of it as me squandering money.”</p>
 <p>“Young Master.” Wang Ma had the face of an experienced person as she persuaded, “All women like flowers, even if Miss pretends to not like them on the surface, she would still be very happy inside. I watched Miss grow up, how could I not understand her?”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen found those words reasonable, but still felt that buying flowers for his wife was a little strange. In the end he still decided to buy some flowers before going to the hospital tomorrow. Not the red roses though, those were too sappy, instead the carnations were a better choice.</p>
 <p>Right at this time, the doorbell rang.</p>
 <p><i>Who would come to visit this early?</i></p>
 <p>Yang Chen may have only stayed at Dragon Garden for a short period of time, but he learned from Wang Ma that only Ruoxi’s close girl friends would come by occasionally because she rarely appeared in public. Therefore, without even mentioning the frequency of visitors, very few people knew about this villa.</p>
 <p>Wang Ma quickly walked to the door and glanced at the webcam monitor by the door. She was very curious as to what was going on and opened the door.</p>
 <p>The people that stood by the door were a man and a woman. The woman looked to be about seventeen or eighteen years old. She wore a pink hairband, had an adorable appearance and an innocent charm in her beautiful eyes. She wore a light yellow short-sleeved shirt and shorts that had a white cartoon design. Her shorts exposed her long fair legs and displayed her outstanding butt as well, making her body seem exceptionally well developed, which didn’t really match her cute face.</p>
 <p>As for the man, he wore a pair of sunglasses and suit. He was obviously a bodyguard or something similar because he had a solemn expression as he followed behind the young lady.</p>
 <p>When Yang Chen glanced over, he immediately frowned, the visitors were actually the brat TangTang whom he hadn’t seen for a while and that silly bodyguard named Little Yong-ge.</p>
 <p>[TL: I’m just gonna use big bro = ge, big sis = jie. It’s the same as nii and nee in Japanese.]</p>
 <p>On the day that the Yamata Sect made their move, they just happened to implicate TangTang. Afterwards, Flower Rain, a member of the Yellow Flame Iron Brigade’s Group of Eight had her sent home, and Yang Chen was too lazy to contact her. Originally, he thought that this matter was over and that this brat would have learned her lesson to keep her distance from him, but who could’ve known that she would appear at his door early in the morning!</p>
 <p>TangTang clearly hadn’t forgiven him and even found out where he lived!</p>
 <p>“Hello Miss, who are you looking for?” Wang Ma amiably asked. Anyone who saw a cute young lady like this would speak nicely to them.</p>
 <p>TangTang sweetly smiled, “Auntie, I’m looking for Yang Chen.”</p>
 <p>“Looking for my family’s Young Master?” Wang Ma became all the more confused by this girl’s identity. She didn’t think of her as Yang Chen’s mistress. Wang Ma never thought in that direction because she was still so young.</p>
 <p>When TangTang heard Wang Ma address Yang Chen as “Young Master”, a strange glint appeared in her eyes. She peeked behind the door and saw Yang Chen sitting down on the western dining table having breakfast.</p>
 <p>“Uncle!” TangTang happily called and waved.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen suddenly had the urge to bury his face in the ground. <i>Why hasn’t this little demoness let me go? At least she’s affectionate to me, one shouldn’t hit someone who smiles towards you</i>. So he had no choice but to get up and walk over, “Why are you here this early in the morning?”</p>
 <p>TangTang pouted, which made her appear exceptionally cute, “The last time we met was when I was nearly frightened to death, you didn’t even call to console me. After having no contact for so many days, is it wrong of me to come looking for you?”</p>
 <p>“I’m not your dad, how can I care for you that much? Moreover, it’s not like I’m the one who harmed you.” There was still a half-eaten bun in his mouth as he impatiently said.</p>
 <p>TangTang saw Yang Chen’s expression of indifference, and her originally happy mood turned into a sorrowful one. She pursed her lips and looked like she was about to cry.</p>
 <p>When Wang Ma saw how this pretty little brat had put on such an expression, she felt endless &nbsp;sympathy for her, so she softly urged, “Young Master, this young lady is so considerate, don’t say such a thing, she’s about to cry……”</p>
 <p><i>Cry? Previously when she drove her Porsche and nearly slammed into my BMW, I didn’t see her cry at all! </i>Yang Chen didn’t take TangTang seriously.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Our Miss made this trip to specifically look for you. That’s your blessing, be more polite when you speak!” Little Yong-ge angrily said.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen didn’t give a damn about him. After seeing TangTang appear like a bullied child, he only felt jittery in his heart. His originally great weekend mood had been ruined. He sighed and said, “Alright, don’t make such an expression, you look like you’ve been thrown away by a man. Speak, what have you come here for?”</p>
 <p>TangTang pouted and sniffed, then anxiously looked at Yang Chen, “My…… my Dad wants to meet you.”</p>
 <p>“Your dad’s wants to meet me?” Yang Chen couldn’t make heads or tails of what was going on, and asked, “Huh, why would he want to meet me? I’m already married. Does he plan on making me his son-in-law?”</p>
 <p>TangTang blushed and shook her head as she replied, “That’s not it, because Uncle saved me previously, Dad had always wanted to thank you, but because he has been busy with work, he decided to invite Uncle to meet him.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen lightly snorted and said, “Your dad wants to thank me, it’s not me thanking him, why on earth would I have to go all the way there to meet him?”</p>
 <p>“Because……” TangTang was speechless, he indeed had a point, this was impolite.</p>
 <p>Little Yong-ge who was at the side proudly said, “Don’t think too highly of yourself! My family’s master wanting to meet you is your blessing, an average person can’t meet him even if they wanted to!”</p>
 <p>“My apologies, I’m an unaverage person, but I’m uninterested in meeting him.” Yang Chen made a wave with his hand, signalling the two to leave, “I’m on leave today, and I’m too lazy to go out, you should leave, never come back here again.”</p>
 <p>Little Yong-ge was overwhelmed by anger, with a flushed face he shouted, “You better not fail to appreciate kindness! Although you were lucky to save our Miss once, it was just a fluke! Our Master only invited you only because he’s kind and has a big heart, who do you think you are!? You think you’re a big deal!?”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen yawned, he sincerely didn’t want to wrangle with him, so he said, “You may leave, I still want to continue with my breakfast.”</p>
 <p>TangTang saw that Yang Chen was about to close the door, so she immediately went up to hug Yang Chen’s waist, and anxiously shouted, “Uncle don’t be like this! My… My father really wants to meet you, but because it isn’t suitable for him to come… so… so……”</p>
 <p>“So what?” Yang Chen saw how helpless the girl looked, and couldn’t be too hard on her.</p>
 <p>“So can you please meet him, Uncle? Take it as me begging you, I’ve never begged anyone ever, I’m only begging you because you’re the Uncle I like the most……” TangTang softly and gently pleaded, her pair of bright eyes seemed a little moist. This pitiful look of hers would make anyone’s heart ache.</p>
 <p>There are two things Yang Chen can’t stand, the first is an innocent lady’s tears, the other… he hasn’t thought of yet.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure you aren’t acting, why are you like a small white flower on the edge of a cliff with dewdrops on it? This isn’t like you.” Feeling vexed, Yang Chen rubbed his head.</p>
 <p>TangTang’s expression turned more pure and innocent. She looked like she was about to turn into a sesame filled white glutinous rice ball as she stammered, “Uncle, would you please come with me? f you don’t come with me, Daddy would definitely think that I’ve done something bad to make you angry. I might even get grounded with my allowance stopped, I’ll be stuck alone at home……”</p>
 <p>Wang Ma who stood at the side was nearly moved to tears, she pushed Yang Chen, “Young Master, this young lady is so pitiful, just go with her on a trip. There isn’t anything urgent to attend to anyways, maybe it’s truly inconvenient for her family?”</p>
 <p>Since even Wang Ma had spoken up, Yang Chen couldn’t continue to let TangTang snivel in front of him, so he nodded, “Alright, I’ll go with you, so stop showing such an expression.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, TangTang’s downcast face suddenly beamed, as if all the dark clouds had been swept away. She revealed a pair of sweet little dimples as she clung onto Yang Chen’s arm. She delicately smiled and said, “I knew you’re the nicest, Uncle! I knew you’d come with me!”</p>
 <p><i>Suddenly turning like this, how was she pitiful at all! She’s simply a little demoness!</i></p>
 <p>Yang Chen finally realized that his cultivation levels had dropped, even a brat who hadn’t matured yet could trick him!</p>
 <p><i>What a sham!!!</i></p>
 <p>TangTang was sent in a black Audi A8, it looked like it had been modified. At the very least, from one glance, Yang Chen could tell that it had been through bulletproof treatment, it seemed like TangTang’s father was also afraid of something happening to her.</p>
 <p>Little Yong-ge sat at the front passenger seat, while Yang Chen and TangTang sat in the back. For the other two Passats, one was upfront and the other behind. There were several bodyguards wearing black in them as well.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen was a little astonished, it seemed like TangTang’s family wasn’t just some ordinary well-off family, just this team of bodyguards alone could compete with the leaders of some small countries. They were evidently afraid because of the kidnapping before.</p>
 <p>Recalling previously at Maple Forest Leisure Centre, Zhou Dongcheng said the attack was orchestrated by him, Yang Chen began to think that such measures were necessary. Afterall, Zhou Dongcheng represents Dongxing, to force the crown prince of Zhonghai’s east region’s underworld to personally send people, the issue must be pretty big.</p>
 <p>After the three cars drove out of Zhonghai’s city centre, it drove towards the coastal area in the southeast area. They drove till they arrived at a leisure villa close to the beach, then slowed down and entered a manor facing the sea.</p>
 <p>The bright and beautiful sunlight, the salty sea breeze, and the unending blue sea.</p>
 <p>The building was styled like a western garden, with a round roof, short Roman-styled pillars, with safflowers and green leaves intertwined as decorations. On the pure white house, there was a gaudy balcony extended outwards with yellow flowers and vines hanging down on it.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen followed the proud Little Yong-ge and the others into the manor with TangTang. He realized that there were over ten bodyguards in the living room, and they all wore stern expressions, as if a fight might break out anytime, they couldn’t let down their vigilance.</p>
 <p>When they reached the staircase, a man wearing a deep blue short-sleeved shirt walked over expressionlessly. He had short hair, thin lips, bulging muscles, like he was carved with a stone, and had a gaze like a sharp sword.</p>
 <p>“Master is waiting for you upstairs, come with me.” The man indifferently glanced at Yang Chen, after speaking, he didn’t even wait for Yang Chen to keep up. He just turned around and climbed back up the staircase.</p>
 <p>Facing the indifferent man’s commanding tone and look of disdain, Yang Chen creased his brows, and remained standing where he was, motionless…...</p>
