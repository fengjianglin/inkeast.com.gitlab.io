 <p>Chapter 114: Answer</p>
 <p><span style="color: #993300;">Careful not to pitch a tent at work, Even though it’s okay sometimes make sure you’re alone, Enjoy xD PG13 NSFW</span></p>
 <p>When Yang Chen arrived at the deepest parking lot on the second floor, Mo Qianni’s red Audi A4 was there as expected, but the car was locked. As the car’s windows were tinted, one couldn’t see the interior.</p>
 <p>When Yang Chen walked over, and knocked on the car door, there wasn’t the sound of any activity inside.</p>
 <p>Revealing a profound smile, Yang Chen pretended to turn around and leave……</p>
 <p>“Yang Chen!”</p>
 <p>The back door of the car immediately opened a tiny crack, Mo Qianni’s beautiful and rosy cheek stuck out a little as she nervously shouted Yang Chen’s name.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen pretended to be shocked as he turned around, “Yo, Department Head Mo, you’re really inside huh. I was wondering why you haven’t come to work this morning. So you were hiding in your car, are you playing hide and seek?”</p>
 <p>“Hide your ass!” Mo Qianni was going mad from anxiousness, without the demeanor of a virtuous woman, she couldn’t help but shout, “What the hell is going on! Why have I become like this for no reason?!”</p>
 <p>“Become like what?” Yang Chen smiled mischievously as he asked.</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni’s pretty face blushed, she stammered, “That is… why have my… my… my clothes all disappeared?”</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni felt like she was living in a nightmare, she was originally in a good mood today, because of Yang Chen’s suggestion, she was able to resolve a bunch of problems at home. However, right when she arrived at the company and was about to get off the car, she suddenly felt dizzy, then her vision darkened, and she didn’t know what happened afterwards.</p>
 <p>When she woke up again, she realised that she was lying on the back seat of her car naked, even her black pantyhose had all been stripped off! Not a single piece was left!</p>
 <p><i>God damn it! I’m not a female MC of a horror film, what’s this!? Such a strange phenomenon doesn’t even happen in movies!</i></p>
 <p>Yang Chen didn’t continue joking with her, it seemed like his pretty lady superior had a great mental endurance, and didn’t break down in this situation. Therefore he calmly said, “If you want to know the cause of all this, I can tell you, but this matter is rather bizarre, so it’s up to you to believe it.”</p>
 <p>“Say it first.” Mo Qianni had rarely seen Yang Chen being serious. Although she didn’t have any clothes on and felt awkward hiding in the car, she still stabilized her state of mind to look at Yang Chen through the crack of the door.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen sort out his thoughts, then began to slowly narrate what happened this morning.</p>
 <p>The gist of the story was, there were a bunch of evil people who wanted to steal something valuable from Yang Chen, but Yang Chen didn’t actually have this item, so he couldn’t give it to them. Therefore, they thought of using the people close to Yang Chen as a bargaining chip to force Yang Chen to pass it to them. However, they never expected that they weren’t able to defeat Yang Chen in the end, so their scheme failed.</p>
 <p>As for the matter regarding Zhang Fugui at the company’s entrance, it was harder to explain, so Yang Chen could only explain that, before those evil people decided to use Mo Qianni, they had already investigated Mo Qianni’s background. After knocking Mo Qianni out, one of them who was an expert at disguise, to the point of being able to completely change her face, pretended to be Mo Qianni. She even imitated her perfectly, then used their chess piece Zhang Fugui to bring Mo Qianni and Yang Chen trouble. They didn’t just affect Mo Qianni’s image, they even made Yang Chen appear to be Mo Qianni’s lover. But the matter didn’t turn out too bad, because Yang Chen quickly dragged the woman away, the only problem was that the gossips would probably circulate for quite a while.</p>
 <p>After hearing all that, Mo Qianni remained silent for a good while, then raised her head with uncertainty and said, “That thing is actually in your hands, isn’t it?”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen was stunned, “What thing?”</p>
 <p>“The thing that they are trying to steal, it’s actually in your hands. You lied to them, right?”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen promptly shook his head, “How can that be, I really don’t have it.”</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni gave him a queer look, then asked again, “Fine then, let’s say for example that you had it, and wasn’t able to defeat them today, would you use trade that thing in exchange for my life?”</p>
 <p>This sudden question caught Yang Chen off-guard, he felt his heart shake despite his great mental strength.</p>
 <p><i>Would I? Would I Use the God’s Stone to trade for this woman’s life?</i></p>
 <p>“This…… I feel that I have no need to answer, they’re no match for me.” Yang Chen equivocated.</p>
 <p>“What I’m asking is what if you can’t defeat them. I want you to answer me now, right now!” Mo Qianni stubbornly asked, the flush on her face gradually receded, there was a nervous and fidgety look in her eyes, but there was even more anticipation.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen silently stared at her, a totally different image appeared in his mind……</p>
 <p>During the recruitment process, that graceful figure with that confident smile…… When sending him to the hoodlum company, that crafty and tyrannical look…… Her cute face of shock when she received the check he brought back…… When accompanying Lin Ruoxi by her bedside, that gentle and simple rear view…… When she kidnapped by Lin Kun, how she strongly resisted and cursed……</p>
 <p>At the roadside stall, the woman poured and drank the strong alcohol herself, telling him the stories of her past…… At the construction site, the woman’s depressed and helpless tears, and her tenacity to hold on to her bag when her inhumane stepfather tugged on it……</p>
 <p>Some time ago, this woman suddenly hugged him, and even gave him a moist and trembling kiss. The kiss contained that sweet taste of alcohol that seemed to still linger in his mouth.</p>
 <p>These scenes became a short yet unforgettable movie, constantly surfacing in Yang Chen’s mind.</p>
 <p>Seeing Yang Chen deep in thought, a depressed emotion showed in Mo Qianni’s eyes, and she lowered her gaze.</p>
 <p>“Forget it, if you don’t want to answer……”</p>
 <p>“I would!”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen suddenly revealed a bright smile and raised his head, with clear eyes he looked at Mo Qianni, “I would trade it if I really had that thing. However, I believe that day would never come, for they’re really no match for me.”</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni felt her heart pounding, she could hear it rapidly thumping from her ears. Her face blushed all the way back to her ears, and her eyes began to glisten with tears.</p>
 <p>*Bang!*</p>
 <p>The car door was quickly shut, Mo Qianni shrunk back in again.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen expression turned wooden. He was wondering what happened, so he immediately knocked on the car door, “Miss Mo, what are you doing? You’re not a tortoise, what are you shrinking inside for?”</p>
 <p>“You’re the tortoise!” Mo Qianni angrily opened the door again, she resentfully pouted, her eyes were red like she had just rubbed away tears.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen’s eyes immediately stared straight at Mo Qianni, it turned out that this time the crack between the door was too big, allowing Yang Chen to see Mo Qianni’s supple and well-developed body in the back seat.</p>
 <p>Although the lighting in the car was very poor, her exquisitely smooth and snow-white skin could still be seen. Her two large buns of flesh swayed like ripe fruits. Below the alluring tight waist was her round plump buttocks and her beautiful long legs. Since Mo Qianni bent her body from her sitting position, her whole figure seemed especially exquisite and attractive.</p>
 <p><i>This woman’s figure isn’t inferior to Rose’s in any way.</i> Yang Chen secretly thought.</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni realized that the situation wasn’t right. She cried out in alarm, closed the door again, and yelled from inside the car, “Yang Chen quickly find me clothes! You sex maniac!! Lecherous pervert!!”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen quivered all over. <i>This woman’s temper was still as explosive as ever, so uncute, it’s not like she’ll get pregnant just from being looked at.</i></p>
 <p>Shaking his head and releasing a bitter sigh, Yang Chen hesitated over where he should go to get Mo Qianni some clothes. He wasn’t just buying a piece or two, even her underwear had been stripped away, this would be his first time buying underwear for a woman.</p>
 <p>Right at this time, Mo Qianni opened the rear car door by a crack again, squeezing the Audi car key through it and dropping it onto the ground.</p>
 <p>“Open the car’s boot, there’s a black Abercrombie and Fitch bag, inside the bag contains clothes that I can change into. Go take them out and pass them to me.” Mo Qianni grouchily said.</p>
 <p>As if he had received amnesty, Yang Chen quickly ran to the back of the car and opened the trunk. Sure enough, there were a large bunch of clothes inside. This makes sense, after all, in such a high-level working environment, how could she not prepare some clothes to change into?</p>
 <p>After he placed the bag beside the car door, Mo Qianni said, “Turn around and walk further away, I want to take the bag.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen obediently moved a distance away, he then heard the sounds of Mo Qianni taking the bag in.</p>
 <p>Once he thought about the beauty’s splendid figure in the car being less than six meters away from him, Yang Chen reflected on how he was indeed an innocent and kind youngster, he managed to endure this!</p>
 <p>After approximately ten minutes, Mo Qianni was finally done putting on her clothes, she opened the car door and walked out.</p>
 <p>She wore a gray suit, and inside she wore a white flowery blouse with a creased design. Her hair was tied up, as she once again became the capable, confident and charming Department Head Mo.</p>
 <p>The way Mo Qianni looked at Yang Chen was a little strange, though she didn’t seek to dodge eye contact. The many years of working experience gave this woman an unimaginable level of psychological control over herself. Despite having been seen naked by Yang Chen a while ago, she was still able to maintain a good mood, and say “Thank you” to Yang Chen.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen didn’t dare accept this thanks, if it wasn’t because of him, she wouldn’t have experienced something like that, so he could only awkwardly shake his head, “No need for thanks, I’ll thank the heavens as long as you don’t hate me.”</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni glared at him, then asked, “Earlier, you said that Zhang Fugui came to the company to cause trouble, where is he now?”</p>
 <p>“If nothing unexpected happens, he should be in the hospital by now, what’s up? The matter between you and him hasn’t be settled?”</p>
 <p>A look of determination showed in Mo Qianni’s eyes, “Following your suggestion, I lied to my mother saying Zhang Fugui wanted to divorce her. Sure enough, she didn’t get angry, she didn’t mind it at all. So I was able to confirm that Mom didn’t actually love him at all.”</p>
 <p>“Then have you gotten Zhang Fugui to sign the divorce agreement?”</p>
 <p>“I have the evidence you gave to me at the construction site previously, if he doesn’t want to sign it, he’d go to jail, he has no other choice.” Mo Qianni sneered, “Although he came here to make a ruckus today because he was incited by the bad people you mentioned, he brought me trouble as well, but that’s also fine. This way, I can totally give up on him. Today I will go to the hospital to tell him, if he tries to make anymore trouble, I will see him in court.”</p>
 <p>“This method is pretty good.”</p>
 <p><i>As expected of a successful career woman, she does things swiftly and decisively.</i> Yang Chen rubbed his chin in thought, then asked, “Then what about the other matter? You’ve now become a mistress, we’re now lovers, this wouldn’t be good for your reputation, right?”</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni blushed, and said with a thin voice, “It’s alright…...”</p>
 <p>“What’s alright, this isn’t even true, as a man I wouldn’t care, but a young beauty like you would lose out.” Yang Chen seriously said.</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni pursed her lips, “Earlier, you said you ‘would’, so I don’t mind.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen couldn’t make heads or tails of what she was saying. <em>What did she mean by ‘would’, so she doesn’t mind?</em></p>
 <p>It seemed like Mo Qianni didn’t want to explain herself, she had already walked towards the the exit of the car park. But after a few steps, she suddenly stopped, turned around, and said to Yang Chen, “Yang Chen, once my mother has completely cut off all relationship with Zhang Fugui, I would find some time to move her to Zhonghai to live, so that it’ll be convenient to take care of her. When that happens, I want you to go to my hometown with me, you aren’t allowed to reject!”</p>
 <p>There was a coquettish tone as she spoke. Once she said her piece, the woman gracefully turned back and walked off in quick steps.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen stood alone where he was, fiercely grabbing his own hair. He suddenly thought of one matter……</p>
 <p>A few years ago, a famous presenter in the US interviewed one of the most intelligent scientists in the world, Stephen Hawking. He asked Hawking, what in this world does an intellectual figure like yourself find impossible to understand?</p>
 <p>Hawking who sat on the wheelchair with his head slanted answered without any hesitation. “Women!”</p>
