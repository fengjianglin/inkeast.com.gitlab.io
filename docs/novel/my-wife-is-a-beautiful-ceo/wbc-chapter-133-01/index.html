 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intuition told Yang Chen that Zhao Hongyan must’ve met with trouble. Although the other ladies were drunk and didn’t notice a thing, Yang Chen still noticed the discomfort that appeared on Zhao Hongyan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already autumn and cold wind blew through the streets. Not many people were willing to stroll through the streets at this time. Occasionally, people would walk by, but they passed by quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking out of the bar, Yang Chen looked around, but he couldn’t find the figures of Zhao Hongyan and Yu Hui anywhere. This gave him a headache, as he had no choice but to search everywhere……</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, several streetlights illuminated the small car park behind the bar. Zhao Hongyan was wearing a gray knitted coat and a black folded skirt and her black stockings matched well with her mature charm. But right now her face was filled with anxiety, and she seemed to be in a bad mood as she walked to a corner in the car park.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After some hesitation, Zhao Hongyan took out her small phone and prepared to make a phone call. But after finding the phone number, she didn’t dare to dial it and make this call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on, my dear sister-in-law? You don’t dare to call my brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Hui’s voice was heard from behind Zhao Hongyan and it sounded extremely playful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Hongyan’s body shivered, and she slowly turned around to face Yu Hui. With a nervous tone she said, “Little Hui, why have you come out? I was just about to make the call.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s late and I’m afraid that something would happen to you if I left you alone, my dear sister-in-law. Thus I came out to keep watch.” Yu Hui nefariously smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m your sister-in-law, not your little sister. What could possibly happen to me?” Zhao Hongyan lowered her head and made an embarrassed smile. She stroked her hair while her gaze drifted about, afraid to look directly at Yu Hui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Hui walked a few steps closer, till there was only a meter distance left between him and Zhao Hongyan, and said, “I only have one sister-in-law, and my brother only has one wife, how can I not be worried? Sister-in-law, don’t mind me, it’s better if you gave my brother a call and let him be at ease.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… you return first, I’ll make the call.” Zhao Hongyan’s breathing was disorderly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why must I go in? Are you saying that you have to conceal something from me when calling my brother? Or are you… guilty because you didn’t plan to make the call at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu Hui!” Zhao Hongyan’s face was flushed. She raised her head to stare back at the young man who wore a strange smile, “What do you mean by that!? How can you speak to me, your sister-in-law, like this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Hui didn’t seem to care about what she said as he snorted and replied, “Sister-in-law? I’m only calling you sister-in-law because I’m showing you respect…… Zhao Hongyan, you really think that by marrying my brother you’ve become our Yu Family’s mistress? What are you pretending to be mighty in front of me for? Why don’t you think about what your status actually is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never thought about it like that, don’t slander me!” Zhao Hongyan shouted back, her eyes were moist with tears from being wrongly accused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Hui became more excited and complacent, “I don’t care what you think. I just know that if I tell my brother you went drinking at a bar without informing him, and that there’s a man with you, how will he react?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re just colleagues, is there a problem having a drink together!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The key point is that my brother wouldn’t think the same way. I seem to recall that he hates that you go to bars and clubs the most. Don’t tell me that you told my brother that you were going to a restaurant today or something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Hongyan’s pretty face paled, her lips were slightly parted, yet she couldn’t say a thing. She had indeed told her husband that. But it was truly unexpected that Yu Hui happened to appear in the same bar……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she imagined what would happen if her husband found out that she drank at a bar, Zhao Hongyan’s mind was overwhelmed with fear. She felt that her legs couldn’t stand stably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Hui walked two steps closer, seemingly about to stick his body against Zhao Hongyan’s. He sniffed the mix of alcohol and body fragrance on Zhao Hongyan’s body. With a mean glint in his eyes, he asked, “Do you know what would stop me from telling my brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Hongyan blushed. She was able to make out what this man was referring to and she quickly took two steps back. However, behind her was the cold and solid wall. She was cornered……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Hui coldly snorted and fiercely pushed both his hands forward. He pressed Zhao Hongyan against the wall, making it difficult for her to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The distance between the two of them was so close that they could feel each other’s breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the dim lights, Zhao Hongyan’s fair and slim face was flushed as she was both nervous and humiliated. The way her tears filled her eyes evoked pity from others. Her full breasts repeatedly heaved and revealed a captivating arc. The fragrance of her slightly tipsy body was unendingly released to the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Hui greedily sized up his mature sister-in-law, “Speak, do you want me to tell my brother, or will you yield to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Hongyan shook her head bitterly, “Little Hui, you can’t do this, I’m your sister-in-law……”</span></p>
