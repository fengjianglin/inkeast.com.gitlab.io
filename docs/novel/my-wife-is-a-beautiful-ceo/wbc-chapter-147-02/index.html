 <p>“Why did you become an air stewardess?” Yang Chen asked.</p>
 <p>“I was an air stewardess from the beginning though?” An Xin indolently replied, “Because I don’t want to follow the life planned by my father for the rest of my life, so I became an air stewardess without even graduating from college. Only by taking planes here and there will I be able to get away from being imprisoned in my father’s cage.</p>
 <p>“Your father gave consent?”</p>
 <p>“This airline’s CEO is an uncle of mine, he liked my mother very much when they were younger, and he treated me dearly since I was a child. When I said that I wanted to be an air stewardess, he arranged for me to be one, even if my father wants to oppose this, he has no means.” An Xin craftily laughed.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen smiled, as the dots finally connected, “What about your fiance? Is he still bothering you?”</p>
 <p>An Xin shook her head, “I don’t want to know anything about him, I told Dad that I would kill myself if he continues to force me. As I have done something mad once, perhaps he’s truly afraid now. In any case, I’m no longer a child, I can work for a few years as an air stewardess first. In the future, that annoying fellow might be married to another woman, and I don’t need to suffer a headache from them anymore.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve just made a decision.” Yang Chen said with a smile.</p>
 <p>An Xin showed a little suspicion as she asked, “What?”</p>
 <p>“Previously at the police station, you said that if we met again, you’d give birth to a child for me, remember? How should we settle this then?”</p>
 <p>An Xin was stunned, slightly panicking she replied, “You can’t really be expecting me to give birth to a child for you, right? It’s impossible for us, my father will not agree for me to be married to you.”</p>
 <p>“I never said I wanted to marry you.” Yang Chen said with a smile, “I’m already married, and my wife is very pretty.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean, you’re toying with me!?” An Xin panted with rage, hearing that Yang Chen had a wife, she felt a bad taste in her mouth.</p>
 <p>“I’m not toying with you.” Yang Chen seriously answered, “I’ve realized that I can no longer accept allowing you to be in another man’s possession, you’ll have to be my woman for the rest of your life. Otherwise, I will kill whoever gets together with you.”</p>
 <p>An Xin was about to say that Yang Chen must be joking, but she immediately noticed that the seriousness in this man’s gaze. Although he sounded so casual, the confidence in his eyes made her believe him. <i>He isn’t just casually saying it; he’ll really kill any other man!?</i></p>
 <p>“Can you not be like this… I… I’m scared……” An Xin timidly lowered her head.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen kissed on her forehead, smiled and said, “What’s there to be afraid of? It’s not like I’m going to eat you, I’m just making the announcement that you belong to me.”</p>
 <p>“How can you be so tyrannical, seizing my human rights?” An Xin softly complained.</p>
 <p>“There’s no absolute fairness in this world, from the night you seduced me in the bar to open a hotel room, you were destined to have today’s outcome. You can think of it as me being a tyrant, a rude, vulgar, and evil man. I don’t care about that, but I can promise you that every word I say to you is true. I like you, so I want you to be my woman. If you doubt my abilities, I don’t mind killing off all other men around you to prove my point, even your father……”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen’s tone was dull, but the madness contained in his words deeply touched An Xin.</p>
 <p>After a long while, An Xin softly sighed and asked, “You meanie, what do you like about me?”</p>
 <p>“There’s no reason for liking someone, but everything can be a reason for disliking someone.”</p>
 <p>An Xin’s eyes looked a little bewitched, she pouted and said, “Do you say such words to every single woman?”</p>
 <p>“No, you might not be the woman I love the most, but you’re the first who made me want to say such things.”</p>
 <p>“If I became your woman, am I destined to spend the rest of my life as your secret mistress?”</p>
 <p>“If you don’t mind, you can sit right in front of my wife, chat and sip tea in front of her. I don’t mind at all, it all depends on your abilities.” Yang Chen said with a smile.</p>
 <p>An Xin caressed Yang Chen’s face with her soft and warm hand, with misty eyes she said, “Yang Chen, you make me clueless as to how to reject you, perhaps I have truly fallen into your trap. However, I don’t like the feeling of being dominated… will you allow one more willful request?”</p>
 <p>“What willful request?”</p>
 <p>An Xin raised her forefinger, pursed her lips, then said, “Within a year, you don’t intentionally look for me or I won’t intentionally look for you. If we meet again in such circumstances, I will listen to everything you say, I will be your lover, give birth to a child for you, and belong to you……”</p>
 <p>“And what if we don’t meet?” Yang Chen said with a smile that wasn’t a smile. Fact was, this problem was too simple for him, as long as he wants to, he’d definitely be able to find An Xin, as for whether that was intentional, who could say it with absolute certainty?</p>
 <p>“If we do not meet…….” A little sad, An Xin replied, “That means we have love but aren’t fated to be together. However, for you, I will never be with another man, I’m really afraid that you’ll kill……”</p>
 <p>Women are creatures who follow their feelings. For her who had always lacked a sense of security, she was more willing to believe in the so-called “destiny” to confirm the place she belongs.</p>
 <p>“Fine, I promise you, but you’re not allowed to go back on your words.” Yang Chen happily said.</p>
 <p>An Xin pouted, rolled her eyes at him in a bashful manner, and said, “I’ve already been defiled by you, who else can I be with?”</p>
 <p>When the two tidied up their appearance, about an hour had passed from start to end.</p>
 <p>An Xin opened the toilet door, and found out that there were already many male and female passengers standing outside the door with dissatisfied expressions. Apparently, they were all waiting to use the lavatory.</p>
 <p>An Xin could only give them an apologetic smile, then immediately went off to her working area.</p>
 <p>Right when a female passenger wanted to enter the lavatory, Yang Chen walked out of it.</p>
 <p>All of the passengers present were stunned. <i>A man and a woman in a single lavatory!?</i></p>
 <p>Yang Chen saw everybody’s strange gazes, so he unhappily said with a loud voice, “What the hell are you looking at! Men stand and pee, women sit, is there a problem with using the toilet together!?” After saying that, he walked back into the business class area.</p>
 <p>The remaining passengers stared dazedly at the only toilet bowl in the lavatory…...</p>
