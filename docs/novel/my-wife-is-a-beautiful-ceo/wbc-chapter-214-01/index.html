 <p>Chapter 214-1: Honestly</p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Abbess Yun Miao’s next level explanation, the young nun Hui Lin totally lost her bearings, it was almost as if she took this as the truth, as she seemed delighted when she glanced at Yang Chen, then lowered her head in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Zhiguo finally spoke again at this point, and he seemed both physically and mentally exhausted, “Yun-er, all that you have said is true. I have failed the children, whether as a father or grandfather. I feel especially guilty towards Hui Lin and Ruoxi, I wasn’t able to fulfill my part as their grandfather, and had never even carried them when they were children. There were too many matters I had to attend to in the past and I used it as my excuse, but now that I think about what I had done, I realize that I am indeed inferior to this stinky brat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he said that, Lin Zhiguo looked towards Yang Chen, then said, “You shouldn’t act conceited. Although you may be slightly better than me, don’t assume that I have no knowledge of the fact that you have at least three other lovers other than Ruoxi whom you are married to. They are all stuck tightly onto you, did you think you could keep us in the dark?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen honestly replied, “I never intended to conceal this fact, and I wouldn’t abandon a single one of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Abbess Yun Miao had only just learned of this fact, causing her brows to furrow tightly together, “What do you mean by that, are you trying to be the emperor? Huaxia only practices monogamy, you’re being unfaithful to your wife!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Hui Lin’s blushing face turned dark. Her eyes seemed to turn moist, and she pouted in distress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen helplessly sighed, “Abbess, I have never intended to conceal this fact, you just never gave me an opportunity to say it. I admit that I’m not an honorable man, but I will always be truthful to my wife. The fact is Ruoxi has never questioned me on matters like these, while I don’t have any reason to tell her all about it. Sometimes, not knowing some things conversely makes the relationship actually better. But of course, this is also the reason why I don’t want you to push Hui Lin towards me, because I’m truly not much better than your husband……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you dare use me to joke!?” Lin Zhiguo stared at Yang Chen sharply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abbess Yun Miao sneered, “He’s right, at least he dares to admit to his faults. Back then, you would only sneakily cheat on me !”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yun-er! These are completely different matters! He needs to at least respect his elders! Besides, this concerns the happiness of both of my granddaughters, how can I leave this brat be!?” Said Lin Zhiguo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Miao replied with disdain, “Only Hui Lin is my granddaughter, that Lin Ruoxi is yours, and the rest of the Lin Family does not recognize her either. I only care about Hui Lin’s happiness, the rest is none of my concern!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why have you become this unreasonable!? You weren’t like this in the past!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all caused by you, bastard!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he saw this old couple raising their voices in front of their grandchild, Yang Chen completely understood what it meant for a couple to actually quarrel now. The cold war that went on between him and Lin Ruoxi was just a trivial matter in comparison!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, one was the junior sister of his half-master, while the other is the grandfather of his wife. He couldn’t just slip away just because he wanted to avoid trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandma! Grandpa! Stop arguing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this time that Hui Lin finally couldn’t bear to let this continue. She tugged on Abbess Yun Miao and dissuaded them, “If the two of you continue arguing, this matter will never be solved. I will decide my own life, if the two of you continue like this, I will…… I will…… I will ignore both of you from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saying that, Hui Lin angrily stormed out of the tent while wiping away her tears!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah… Hui Lin! Hui Lin! Come back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abbess Yun Miao and Lin Zhiguo both shouted, but Hui Lin ran off without even turning back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next, their gazes landed on Yang Chen, they were itching to flay him alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch out, Yang Chen. I will properly educate your insensibilities for my Senior Brother, I definitely will not let Hui Lin’s husband have multiple lovers!” Said Abbess Yun Miao while she walked out of the army tent. She probably went to look for Hui Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen felt rather gloomy. He never said that he wanted to marry Hui Lin, so why was she trying to manage his relationship with his women? Anyway, Song Tianxing never tried to manage him despite the fact that he taught him this powerful internal skill, so who was she to manage him when she was just Song Tianxing’s junior sister?</span></p>
