 <p>Chapter 27: Bohemia</p>
 <p>Outside the Yu Lei building, Yang Chen was taking a smoke when he noticed a group of crestfallen people, including the wretched Fatty, walk out of the building in succession.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Yang Chen, Fatty’s face displayed a look of anger. “I must say, brother, how is that brain of yours grown? How can you answer such difficult topics? I could only understand 80% of the English test and don’t even mention to me about the French test!”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, it’s all luck, luck.” Yang Chen responded. He couldn’t tell Fatty that because of the strange martial arts he practiced, he could learn something just from seeing it once. Yang Chen could successfully utilize a language after memorizing a dictionary of its language.</p>
 <p>Dejected, Fatty says: “Forget about it, only someone with a brain as abnormal as yours can enter Yu Lei International. The rest of our brothers have all failed, you must uphold the image of us men, as the final torchbearer!”</p>
 <p>(ED: gasps)</p>
 <p>“What! Are there no other men remaining from this round?” Yang Chen asked.</p>
 <p>“Who in the right mind would spend the whole day doing nothing but researching the purpose of underwear designs, and in French and Spanish vocabulary?” Shaking his fat head, “The way I see it, including you, there won’t be more than 5 people remaining!”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen rubbed his head in distress, to be honest, this exam didn’t feel as hard as how Fatty described it to be, but Yang Chen felt that he exposed too much, he should have intentionally answered a few questions wrong. If he got too good of a result, wouldn’t that be too conspicuous and contrary to Yang Chen’s original goal of finding a laidback job?”</p>
 <p>Fatty, letting out a long sigh, patted Yang Chen’s shoulder and said, “Alright, I’m going to drink with some of the other brothers who dropped out, otherwise the pain in our hearts cannot be quelled!”</p>
 <p>After talking, a group of people all wearing the same expression of regret walked to the parking lot.</p>
 <p>With some worries, Yang Chen slowly walked back to the examination hall. Inside the hall, there were only 3 beautiful women left, and if you counted Yang Chen, there were only 4 people who passed the exam!</p>
 <p>Upon entering inside, Mo Qianni and the other examiners all looked at Yang Chen strangely, as if he was a freak.</p>
 <p>As Mo Qianni had seen it all, after pausing for only a brief moment, a smile appeared on her face as she said, “Congratulations, Mr. Yang, you are the sole remaining male applicant to proceed to our final interview. You are also the applicant who scored the highest on the foreign language test, getting the max score.”</p>
 <p>While paying attention to how respectful Mo Qianni was when she spoke to him, Yang Chen was certain that he had showed off too much. His skill in German and Italian caused all these ladies to be thoroughly amazed.</p>
 <p>Awkwardly chuckling, he sat back down and waited for the final interview.</p>
 <p>As there were only 4 applicants remaining, Mo Qianni no longer required a microphone and spoke with a smile, “The 4 of you were capable enough to pass our difficult foreign language test, it seems that all of you do have genuine talent. For the final round, we will be testing your understanding of the fashion industry and your ability to appreciate fine goods.</p>
 <p>As everybody knows, every year, our Yu Lei International’s clothing design changes. And so it is considered a rather difficult task for new employees to identify which clothing belongs to our brand.</p>
 <p>In a while, there will be 10 models wearing this year’s new clothing designs shown to the 4 of you. In 5 minutes or less, the 4 of you must pick the outfit that isn’t our company’s design. There is only one chance, and if you get it right, you’ll be granted a 2 month trial contract no questions asked.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen wrinkled his brows, in all honesty, his understanding towards fashion could be considered nonexistent as he does not care about what he wear. In the past his clothes were all custom-made and he never came in contact with clothing belonging to any brand.</p>
 <p>At the same time, in the exam room, a curtain was being pulled open revealing 10 tall models leisurely walking forward. The spotlights shone at them as they stood in front of the 4 candidates.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the eyes of all 3 women displayed admiration and released a gasp of surprise. Women, innately love all things beautiful, when looking at the 10 outfits in front of them, they all had different thoughts coming in and out of their mind as they started to examine each and every outfit carefully.</p>
 <p>Only after repeatedly examining their boobs, did Yang Chen smack his lips together and start focusing on the outfits.</p>
 <p>Each and every one of these outfits had different sorts of patterns and styles. There were leopard print dresses, lacy one-piece dresses, Tutus made of chiffon, and pink long dresses with straps. There were even elegant business suits for women. The only thing they shared in common was that none of them had any traces of a brand.</p>
 <p>When Yang Chen saw the 10 models, he first stared blankly for a while. Right after, Yang Chen began writing his answer on the given paper without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>When 5 minutes passed, Mo Qianni clapped her hands and an assistant walked up to collect their answer sheets. After finishing, the assistant handed the papers to her.</p>
 <p>Giving them a brief glance, Mo Qianni displayed a flash of surprise and looked at Yang Chen with curious eyes. Pursing her lips and smiling, “The results have already been decided, I am representing the entire Yu Lei International to warmly welcome our new colleague, Mr. Yang Chen.</p>
 <p>After finishing, she took the lead to clap for him. The other employees, after hearing the announcement, all looked at him with curious eyes and started to happily clap to welcome him.</p>
 <p>However, the other 3 applicants found this hard to swallow. Their evaluating skills lost to a man who speaks so vulgarly?. One of the three was displeased and inquired, “Proctor, can you tell us the correct answer?”</p>
 <p>After Mo Qianni quieted the people around, smiled toward that female applicant, looked at Yang Chen and asked, &nbsp;“Mr. Yang, please tell us how you arrived at the correct answer”.</p>
 <p>Although Yang Chen didn’t care about how people viewed him, he knows it isn’t good to not give face to his future superior in front of this many people, Yang Chen sighed and raised his hand, pointing to the 10th model and said “I chose her.”</p>
 <p>It was evident that the other 3 applicants blanked out for a moment, but afterwards, they started to look at the 10th model again.</p>
 <p>This model was wearing a classic European Bohemian styled long dress, because Bohemian ladies clothing seemed complex and difficult to grasp. Various tassels and pendants required careful matching, moreover this type of ancient wandering gypsy freedom, along with the clothing’s mysterious air was not something modern ladies can control, and so this type of dress was not well liked.</p>
 <p>But because of that being too obvious, the three lady candidates only took a short glance at number 10 before ruling it out. They did not believe, that after giving them such a difficult foreign language exam, such a big loophole would appear, after all this Bohemian dress was too gaudy! They kept thinking that it is a trap!</p>
 <p>Yang Chen does not care about the 3 ladies’ shock and regrets, he unenthusiastically explains: “If I’m right, the Bohemian dress Model number 10 is wearing, was handmade by an old-fashioned Italian designer. The crystals on this dress’ girdle and pendants on the fringed skirt are all real and elaborately polished crystals. The diamond pieces on the chest are also real South African diamonds. In my opinion, although Yu Lei International is one of the top 10 fashion brands in the country, they can’t possibly be using this many high-class natural crystals and diamonds just to make this dress right?”</p>
 <p>This time, not just the three candidates, even all the other Yu Lei International’s employees revealed an expression of disbelief, they originally thought Yang Chen could only tell that this dress isn’t cheap, but did not expect, Yang Chen could even recognize the origins of this dress clearly!</p>
 <p>What everyone present doesn’t know is, Yang Chen was extremely happy inside. The designer of this dress was the old fella who used to make custom-made dress shirts for him.</p>
 <p><em>I wore the clothes for so many years, how can I not recognize this style, this level of extravagance, is by whom? Nobody else in this world can compare with me in understanding this guy’s style!</em></p>
 <p>Looking at the grand and refined Bohemian dress, Yang Chen revealed a wistful expression. He softly spoke in his heart, “Ron, you stubborn old man who refuses to wear reading glasses despite suffering from presbyopia, are you living well?”</p>
