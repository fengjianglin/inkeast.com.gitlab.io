 <p>“Ermm……” Yang Chen regretted randomly choosing the test papers, if he knew this would’ve happened, he would have chosen English and French as written in his resume, but right now he could only brace himself for whatever that comes his way, “That is just a hobby, I’m pretty talented at foreign languages.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? What other innate skills do you have then?” Ruoxi asked as she crossed her arms in front of her chest with a face full of disbelief.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen scratched his nose, because he was embarrassed to say that he actually had quite a number of innate skills. While he was most adept at fighting and killing, on the more high-tech side, he was also talented in controlling aircraft, tanks, firearms and hacking. However, these talents were not appropriate to share in a conversation, so he simply shook his head and said, “Nope, this brain of mine only has that much capacity, well-appraised, my lord wife.”</p>
 <p>“You’re not allowed to call me that!” Lin Ruoxi once again corrects the uncomfortable form of address that nearly turned her eyebrows vertical, and angrily said, “Yang Chen, no matter the reason, since you chose Yu Lei International and became my employee, there are some things I must make clear to you.”</p>
 <p>“It can’t be that you want to fire me right?” Yang Chen gloomily raised his hands, “Hey, my dear w…Erm…. Boss Lin, it took me a lot of effort to find a job that fits your requirements, sitting in an office, dignified, and can keep clean at work. You don’t have to be so cruel to me right? Although I’m born a bit more handsome than others, and may cause harm to our fellow colleagues, but a loyal man like me would never womanize. Also, wild flowers can never smell as fragrant as the flower at home, don’t you think so…….”</p>
 <p>“Hold your tongue!” Ruoxi couldn’t stand it anymore as she slammed her hand down at the desk. She pouted and her lips formed an arc, this guy did not have any EQ, could it be that this is what all graduates of famous colleges in the US are like? Could it be that the Americans have a different way of looking at things?</p>
 <p>Yang Chen tried his best to hold back his laughter, he had no idea why every time he sees the bashful look of his convenient wife, he feels so happy inside.</p>
 <p>Like the creative concept written by a poet…… It is most of all the gentleness of bowing one’s head, that is like the lotus flower that the cool breeze cannot compete in shyness……</p>
 <p>(TL:This was a poem written by Xu Zhimo, a famous poet and cousin of Jinyong)</p>
 <p>Of course, Lin Ruoxi might look like a lotus flower, but she wasn’t that gentle. Her mature, city woman’s high self-esteem, along with that innocent childishness, was the most attractive thing about her.</p>
 <p>Only after a while did Lin Ruoxi calm down. With a gaze full of ‘killing intent’ she said, “Yang Chen, while we are in the company, we must agree upon a three-point-law.”</p>
 <p>(TL: 3 rules Yang Chen must follow.)</p>
 <p>“Alright, as long as you don’t fire me, I’m fine with anything.” Said Yang Chen, as he didn’t want to argue with this girl.</p>
 <p>“First, you’re not allowed to call me by those disgusting names, you must address me as Boss Lin or CEO just like the other employees. Second, you can’t just randomly waltz into my office, and in public, we must maintain a distance. Third, you can’t tell anyone in this company that we are married. Fourth…”</p>
 <p>“Wait! Wait! Wasn’t this a three-point-law? How can there be a fourth point?” Yang Chen raised his hand in protest.</p>
 <p>“Bam!” Lin Ruoxi slammed both her hands down on the desk, with her eyes widened. “If I say how many laws, that’s how many laws! If I say how many points that’s how many points! You’re not allowed to interrupt me!”</p>
 <p>“Erm…yes.” Yang Chen forced a smile.</p>
 <p>Lin Ruoxi continued: “Fourth, while you are working here, I will carefully supervise you. You are not allowed to break the status quo of the office. As long as you do your job, I won’t fire you. Even if you drift aimlessly, I won’t fire you as long as you don’t stir up trouble in the office. Fifth…”</p>
 <p>After listening to Lin Ruoxi talk for no less than 10 minutes, Yang Chen stifled a yawn. Lin Ruoxi was almost finished speaking.</p>
 <p>“Boss Lin, you’re finished right? If you have, I’ll leave first.” Said Yang Chen, as he curried favor with Lin Ruoxi because he was scared that she would burst out in more rules and stipulations, he’s already forgotten how many points she has made.</p>
 <p>Lin Ruoxi contemplated for a bit and nodded her head: “We’ll stop here for today. You must comply with everything I told you. Outside, I don’t care what you do, that’s your problem and we have a non-aggression pact, but when you’re in the office, you must listen to me and abide by the rules.”</p>
 <p>“Yea yea yea…” Yang Chen hurried to stand up, stretch, and leave the room.</p>
 <p>At that moment, in the office, a stylish azure-colored phone rang. Stretching out her hand, Lin Ruoxi picked the phone up, pressed a button, and answered the call. On the other side, the voice of the cold secretary, Wu Yue, could be heard: “Boss Lin, General Manager Xu Zhihong has invited you to attend have dinner with him at the Blue Bay Hotel to talk about this year’s partnership for the Autumn Fashion Show.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the name “Xu Zhihong”, Lin Ruoxi made an obvious frown, “Wu Yue, can’t we cancel it?”</p>
 <p>On the other side of the line, Wu Yue hesitated for a moment and said, “Boss Lin, you have already rejected Mr Xu’s private invitations three times, this time’s business is regarding the Autumn Fashion Show, and every single exhibition area’s construction requires support from Donghua Science &amp; Technology’s resources and manpower. The other party’s reasons are justified, if we cancel again…….it’s a little……”</p>
 <p>“Fine, I understand”, Lin Ruoxi pursed her lips, “Help me arrange this then, tonight I will attend, book two seats.”</p>
 <p>“Boss Lin do you require me to accompany you?”</p>
 <p>“Nope”, Lin Ruoxi raised her head to stare at Yang Chen who is trying to sneakily leave the room, “I will drive there, you may return home once you get off work.”</p>
 <p>“Okay Boss Lin…….” Wu Yue felt things were a little odd, but her unconditional compliance meant she wouldn’t ask anything more.</p>
 <p>Ending the call, Yang Chen who was trying to sneak out stopped, turned his head and laughed: “Boss Lin, you can’t possibly want me to attend. If I recall correctly, Blue Bay hotel is a 5-Star hotel, does my rugged appearance look suitable for a 5-star hotel? Also, I can’t make heads nor tails when it comes to business and cannot help.”</p>
 <p>Lin Ruoxi coldly smiled and said: “You think I wish to bring you along? You only know how to lose face and talk drivel…… However, marrying you, is precisely to make use of you during such times. Later on in the evening, you must utilize all methods to keep Xu Zhihong away from me, best if you can make him completely give up.”</p>
 <p>“Can I make a physical assault?” Yang Chen was somewhat impatient, “How about I just chop him and be done with it.”</p>
 <p>“Not allowed! You can’t allow him to get near me, but our business talks must go on!” said Lin Ruoxi, stressing each and every word.</p>
 <p>Taking in a deep breath, Yang Chen gazed strangely at Lin Ruoxi, grumbled and said, “Boss Lin, are you employing a husband or an Oscar-winning actor?”</p>
 <p>“We have already signed the contract. When in the company of others, you must play your role properly. If you’re a man, you must keep your word.” Lin Ruoxi looked at Yang Chen’s self deflated manner and couldn’t help but feel a small victory.</p>
 <p>Time flew like an arrow as Yang Chen returned to the PR department. The ladies, curious as to why Yang Chen was called to the CEO’s office, all made exaggerated speculations till it was time to get off work.</p>
 <p>Throughout the whole afternoon, Mo Qianni was huffing and puffing in anger as she couldn’t understand why Lin Ruoxi, who she respected for the longest time, rejected the proposition to fire Yang Chen and even invited him to her office. Could it be that Yang Chen has some sort of special background? All these questions remained in Mo Qianni’s mind and would cause her to have insomnia.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Yang Chen rejected the office ladies’ invitation for a welcome cocktail party and by himself, he quietly slipped away to the CEO’s special parking lot.</p>
 <p>Sitting in Lin Ruoxi’s Bentley Arnage, they made their way to the Blue Bay Hotel as planned.</p>
 <p>Night time in Zhong Hai City, a man and a woman, neither one knowing what the other was thinking. While the man and wife’s first showing of love and affection was caused by a surprise phone call by Xu Zhihong.</p>
