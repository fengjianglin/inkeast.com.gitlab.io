 <p>Chapter 206-1: Abrupt changes in the temple</p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black man named Punk walked like a street dancer, his pace had a rhythm to it. He said with a relaxed voice, “Jason, I thought that you were planning to settle these Chinese monkeys with only Judy. Seems like you still need our help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The American man named Jason toyed with Cannon’s machine gun in his hands, and chewed on his chewing gum, “That’d make my darling Judy tired, I can’t bear to let that happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blonde lady, Judy, wasn’t amused, “Do you guys only know how to utter nonsense? If you’re going to help then quickly do it, this scorching weather is abuse to my beautiful skin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at this retarded Chinese monkey, he actually took out two guns. Doesn’t he know that guns are useless against us?” The other black man, Andy, laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jason’s lips formed a slight grin, “Don’t say such a thing, I think it’s a gift from him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cannon impatiently said, “What are you blabbering on for!? Don’t assume that we don’t understand English, you American pigs. I just can’t be bothered to talk to you. If you want to take my guns, then come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, Cannon fired two shots at Jason who stole his machine gun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the trajectory of the bullet was difficult to predict, Jason still managed to dodge it simply by turning his body sideways. He tossed the heavy machine gun to a corner and said, “I like your handguns, that gun is too heavy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Jason spoke, he moved at rapids speed till he was behind Cannon. Before Cannon could react, Jason opened his palms wide!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two invisible forces began to pull the guns towards Jason, to the point that the trigger could no longer be pulled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it!” Cannon shouted. He had no way of dealing with the powerful attraction force, so he had no choice but to let them go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other four Blue Storm members just stood there watching like this was all a play. They didn’t intend to intervene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bigfoot seemed to have thought of something. He turned around and charged towards the blonde lady Judy, intending to continue their fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Carlos, help me block this stupid bear!” Judy said with disgust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carlos who released electric currents seemed very interested in beating Bigfoot, “In that case, you shouldn’t shoot him to death, I want to fry him with electricity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know that plastic can’t conduct electricity!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bigfoot blocked Carlos’ kicks without any fear, but he only used the plastic and leather parts to come in contact with Carlos’s shoes. Carlos had no way of beating Bigfoot in a short period of time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Jason held onto the two modified handguns he newly acquired, and had a complacent smile on his face, “Well then, do you have more guns?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A malicious smile surfaced on Cannon’s face. Suddenly, a thumb-sized remote control appeared in his hands, it had a red button on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jason was startled. He seemed to understand what was going on, and his face blackened. Just as he was about to throw away the guns in his hand, he realized that a crack on the handle of the handguns secreted a strong adhesive, causing the gun to be stuck to his hand!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Jason could say anything more, Cannon pressed the red button to everyone’s dismay!</span></p>
 <p><span style>*Boom boom!!!*</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two guns in Jason’s hands instantly exploded, and intense flames swallowed Jason’s arms!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others watched as Jason’s arms were blown into charred bits and scattered on the floor, while the rest of Jason burned. He fell onto the ground like a lump of charcoal, and met instant death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Storm’s members were finally given a wake up call. They realized that they had underestimated their trapped enemy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cannon tossed away the used remote control, and spat, “True men die honorably, how about you explain it in English? Hehe……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two black men, Punk and Andy finally understood the fact that they had to battle seriously. They glanced at each other, and charged towards Cannon simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bigfoot swung a series of kicks. Relying on the force of Carlos’ kicks, he retreated to Cannon’s side, in an attempt to help Cannon block one of them. However, how could Carlos be this easy to break away from? With a yell, Carlos once again sped up, and his windmill kick which carried electricity was aimed at Bigfoot’s waist!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bigfoot couldn’t block this, so he had to sidestep to dodge, and leave Cannon to deal with the two well-built men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cannon was adept at fighting even without a gun, but Andy and Punk didn’t seem to have any intention to fight him fair and square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Andy closed in, Cannon felt an incredible pressure, he felt like his whole body was being squashed together like he was in a pressure cooker, and his movements were greatly slowed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can this……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Andy’s fierce punch landed on Cannon’s stomach, and Cannon was sent flying off like a grenade!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful! He can control the density of air around you!” Squall’s multiple quick attacks was putting him at a great advantage against Great Compassion, so he finally had the time to consider the others. Seeing Cannon get sent flying, he immediately warned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ability to control the atmosphere was incredible. It didn’t just decrease the density of the air around Cannon, the concentration of particles was also lower than other areas. This made the atmosphere Andy’s greatest assistant, it was like a force that pressured his enemy from every direction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time Cannon moved, it felt like he was encased in ice and trying to break out. Naturally, this made it difficult for him to react to any, and don’t even mention attacking!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Cannon could get up, Punk was already beside him. He grabbed Cannon by the collar, and raised him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Punk was a full two meters tall. Although Cannon was well-built, he still looked a size smaller in comparison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You killed Jason, so you’re an outstanding warrior. However, the best outcome for an outstanding enemy is death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go screw yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cannon raged, a situation like this was humiliation to him. He brandished his fist, and swung it towards Punk’s face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, another strange phenomenon happened. When Cannon’s fist was just a few inches away from Punk’s face, it suddenly stopped, and couldn’t go any further!</span></p>
