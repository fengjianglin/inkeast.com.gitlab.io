 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p>Appearing before them was a Caucasian woman who had chestnut-colored curls, a tall physique, and shapely curves.</p>
 <p>She had light violet eyeshadow, red lips, and beautiful indolent eyes. Her nails were coated with black nail polish. Although her skin wasn’t very white, it still looked fair under the light.</p>
 <p>She dressed up in a punkish style, but the weird thing was the orchid embroidered, dark purple cheongsam that she wore. It possessed a rich Huaxia style.</p>
 <p>From a glance, it was neither fish nor fowl, for the mix between Eastern and Western culture was incredibly intense.</p>
 <p>However, when one looked closely, they would notice that she had mixed the extreme styles of unconventionality together with classical perfectly.</p>
 <p>She used a Western woman’s unique perspective to interpret the charm which Huaxia women pursued.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, be it Li Muhua or Lu Tao, or even Mo Qianni who was a beautiful woman herself, all of them couldn’t help but be filled with a single thought inside; how beautiful.</p>
 <p>However, the most shocked out of them was Yang Chen!</p>
 <p><i>How can it be her!?</i></p>
 <p>Yang Chen’s lips formed a incomparably profound smile. He seemed bitter, yet happy, yet bewildered.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, this woman had already noticed Yang Chen. She first revealed a shocked expression, but immediately after, she threw him a coquettish glance.</p>
 <p>“Fourth Uncle, this person is?” Being the host, Li Muhua walked up with the smile of an amiable gentleman and asked Li Guangxun.</p>
 <p>Li Guangxun’s voice was rather sharp, he didn’t look at his nephew-cum-employer fondly, and proudly introduced, “This is my teacher that I had during my studies in the United Kingdom. She just happened to be in Hong Kong today. I invited her to take a look at the fruits of my past few years of research, and to give me guidance.”</p>
 <p>To be honest, no matter how one looked at Li Guangxun, he was definitely over forty. On the other hand, this Western lady looked to be in her early twenties, and yet she was actually his teacher during his doctorate. It was truly unbelievable!</p>
 <p>“I know that this beautiful lady is your teacher, but could we receive a more detailed introduction?” Li Muhua patiently asked as his gaze shifted onto the beautiful Caucasian lady.</p>
 <p>The woman revealed a perfect smile, and suddenly spoke in a fluent Mandarin, “Hello everybody, my name is Jane Christina Arthur Elizabeth Mountbatten Windsor Alexander. That’s my full name, but if you don’t mind, I prefer to be addressed as… Jane.”</p>
 <p><i>Jane?</i></p>
 <p>A simple name. It was an incomparably simple name, but her incredibly long full name was something that couldn’t be ignored!</p>
 <p>The names of Westerners possesses all kinds of backgrounds, especially one from the United Kingdom which used to be an empire where the sun never sets. The tradition of the nobility allowed their names to represent their noble heritage.</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter if it was the word Arthur, Elizabeth, Mountbatten, or Alexander in her name. All of them were symbols of authority and honor that only a noble would have.</p>
 <p>It goes without saying that many ordinary folk would use the name Jane, but this woman definitely wasn’t a simple commoner!</p>
 <p>Those present weren’t uneducated fools. Hearing such a name, they were immediately able to understand how complex and mysterious Jane’s identity was. So much so that she may even possess a noble title that was unknown to them.</p>
 <p>“I’m very happy to be acquainted with you, Miss Jane.” Li Muhua reached his hand out towards Jane, and revealed a bright gentlemanly smile.</p>
 <p>Jane didn’t shake hands with him, she politely smiled, and with the bearing like a noble princess she said, “You must be the Muyun Corporation’s CEO, Mr. Li Muhua. My apologies, a man taking the initiative to ask for a handshake with a woman is bad etiquette, so I decline.”</p>
 <p>Such a direct rejection made Li Muhua feel a little awkward, but no one thought of this as Jane showing off. It felt more like this was the way Jane should be.</p>
 <p>Li Guangxun frowned and said, “Muhua, you’re not allowed to be rude towards my teacher! Quickly prepare, I haven’t held a welcome reception for my teacher!”</p>
 <p>“Oh, okay.” Li Muhua suddenly felt unhappy inside, but didn’t reveal it. He instructed one of his subordinates, who went to prepare the reception.</p>
 <p>Jane curiously asked, “Little Li, what does welcome reception(jie feng) mean?”</p>
 <p><i>Little Li!?</i></p>
 <p>This form of address was naturally for Li Guangxun. Everybody looked at Li Guangxun with astonishment, they didn’t expect that Professor Li who was over forty was addressed by his teacher, a Westerner, as Little Li!</p>
 <p>Li Guangxun’s face flushed, but he didn’t dare dally, so he immediately answered, “Dear teacher, it means to welcome a guest with a good meal.”</p>
 <p>“Oh… welcome reception(jie feng). I learned another new phrase, haha.” Jane seemed very happy, her contented laugh was bright like it was one from an eighteen year old. She then looked towards Yang Chen and the others and said, “These people are……”</p>
 <p>Li Muhua immediately introduced them, “They are our business partners. I brought them here today to tour the progress of the research institute’s new environmentally friendly material, we’d then make a final revision of our contract. I never expected Miss Jane to honor us with your presence. Miss Jane, as my Fourth Uncle’s teacher, you should be able to give us some pointers in the scientific field, right?”</p>
 <p>Jane doubtfully looked at Yang Chen. She didn’t seem to understand why this man had suddenly turned into an inspection member of a company.</p>
 <p>Li Guangxun saw that Jane didn’t speak up, and thought that his teacher wasn’t willing. Thus, he discontentedly said, “Muhua, how can you ask Teacher to give pointers so casually? Do you know of Teacher’s identity? Even the British Royal Society, America’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, Germany’s Fraunhofer Society, and those other top academies would have difficulty inviting Teacher to even pay them a glance. Do you think Teacher’s pointers can be casually asked for!?”</p>
