 <p>Chapter 193-1: You'll find out in a moment</p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p>When Yang Chen mentioned going out, Rose thought she had misheard, so she asked, “Hubby, did you just say go out?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, my beautiful Miss Rose, wouldn’t you have dinner with this pitiful office worker?” Yang Chen said with a pitiful expression.</p>
 <p>Confirming that she didn’t mishear, a myriad of emotions surfaced on Rose’s face. She was joyful and touched, but was even more confused and suspicious, as this didn’t seem like reality.</p>
 <p>“Then… I’ll go change.”</p>
 <p>Although she was a woman, Rose was evidently faster at dressing up than other ladies. She simply put on a violet flower print dress and a pair of shiny heels, which covered up her tall and well-developed body without losing any of its allure. Her face which had very little makeup on was beautiful and flawless.</p>
 <p>Ten minutes later, she walked out of the bar while holding onto Yang Chen’s arm.</p>
 <p>Having understood that Yang Chen wanted to bring her out on a date, Rose’s smile became brighter, the unexpected surprise made her feel like she was in a dream.</p>
 <p>“Hubby, where are we going for dinner?” Rose ignored the shocked gazes of the Red Thorns Society members outside the bar, and affectionately asked Yang Chen.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen pondered for a moment and asked, “Darling Rose, I believe you have a car, right? How about we drive somewhere further away for dinner, that sounds better than walking around at this time.”</p>
 <p>With bright and beautiful eyes, Rose took out her black iPhone, and made a call.</p>
 <p>“Little Zhao, send someone to drive the new car I bought earlier this year to the bar’s entrance, I want to use it.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen watched as Rose ordered her subordinate. He lamented how he also used to order other people like this, while he had now become a person that someone else orders. Although it was he who asked for it, he was now considered a commoner.</p>
 <p>In less than ten minutes, the car that Rose had asked for was parked in front of the bar. The driver got off the car, and handed the keys over to Rose with reverence.</p>
 <p>Rose handed the keys over to Yang Chen, “Hubby, you drive. I’m not good at driving.”</p>
 <p>When a woman who knows how to drive says that they aren’t good at driving, it’s either to act coquettishly, or to be able to look at the man who drives. Rose was a part of the latter.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen was rather astonished, for Rose’s sapphire blue car was a make rarely seen in the whole of Huaxia. It was a Lotus, a sports car from Britain.</p>
 <p>This sports car was considered high-end overseas. Its trademark design style had a powerful following amongst car enthusiasts, and its beautiful streamline body attracted many female enthusiasts’ eyeballs.</p>
 <p>However, it was the first time Yang Chen had seen one in Huaxia. He hadn’t seen one of these even in Lin Ruoxi’s mini museum.</p>
 <p>“You chose this yourself?” Asked Yang Chen while he opened the door for her.</p>
 <p>Rose gracefully sat inside, and put on the seat belt. She showed an embarrassed smile, “I know how to kill and burn, do usury, and commit kidnappings, but know nothing about cars. They showed me some photos, and I chose this because I found it pretty.”</p>
 <p>Dissatisfied, Yang Chen said, “A lady shouldn’t talk like the boss of a gang, it wouldn’t be nice if you frightened pedestrians.”</p>
 <p><i>Aren’t I the boss of a gang!?</i> Rose pouted, but still replied “okay” with a nod.</p>
 <p>Driving the Lotus attracted the eyes of countless pedestrians. Yang Chen directly got onto the expressway with Rose, and sped to a lakeside in the suburbs of Zhonghai. There were quite a number of high-end Western cuisine restaurants in that area.</p>
 <p>Since he wanted his woman to experience romance and enjoy the beauty of the world, he couldn’t just do a simple date.</p>
 <p>Rose may or may not care about such things, but what Yang Chen would do is a different matter.</p>
 <p>When they got off the car, Yang Chen grabbed onto Rose’s elbow, “Hold on, I’ll open the door for you.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, Yang Chen got off and walked over to the other side of the car under Rose’s surprised gaze. He opened the door, and made a gesture to invite her out.</p>
 <p>“Pretty lady, this way please.”</p>
 <p>The server’s at the restaurant’s entrance all saw this, but they had seen such antics many times and didn’t think much of it.</p>
 <p>But it was different for Rose. It was strange enough that Yang Chen suddenly wanted to bring her out on a date, but he was even treating her like a princess which made her feel awkward. However, she also felt joyful over it, and shyly blushed.</p>
 <p>On certain matters, women would take pleasure in it no matter how awkward it is.</p>
 <p>The two held hands as they entered the lakeside Western cuisine restaurant. The building had a European style and was made of wood and steel, and had decorations like saddles, hooves, knight’s helmets and armors.</p>
 <p>The chandelier lit up the area with dim warm lights, and gave the restaurant a relaxing and romantic ambience.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen watched Rose look around with curiosity, and felt even more guilty, “I’ll bring you out on dates more often in the future. You have so much money and thousands of subordinates, yet shut yourself in that tiny room all day, that’s injustice to your own life.”</p>
 <p>Rose shook her head, “I don’t think so. Ever since I met you, I’ve never felt bored. I’m very happy when you’re with me, and feel satisfied waiting when you’re not.”</p>
 <p>“If I was an actor, I’d definitely shed tears now. Unfortunately, I’m not, but please believe that you’ve touched me.” Yang Chen sincerely said.</p>
 <p>This woman had always used the most direct and unintentional ways to move him.</p>
