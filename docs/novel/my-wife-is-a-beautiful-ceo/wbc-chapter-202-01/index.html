 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p>There was boundless mist, and the scenery was as dark as ink.</p>
 <p>Half an hour ago, as midnight approached, a gray, armed helicopter quietly took off in the mountains. A few miles away was the location of Kunshan Village. The helicopter turned around and flew southwest, and in the dark, barely anything could be seen.</p>
 <p>The pilot of the helicopter was the team’s Vice-Captain, Tsunami, while the co-pilot was the communications expert and also the only female in the team, Leaf.</p>
 <p>At this point, Leaf had already changed out of her peasant clothes, and was wearing black clothes. She had removed her disguise, turning from an innocent mountain girl to a beautiful and sharp-looking Dragon Group secret agent.</p>
 <p>In the cabin behind, Yang Chen sat back on a chair, while Broken Blade who sat beside him briefed him on the mission ever since they boarded.</p>
 <p>Behind them, the other members of the Dragon Group closed their eyes to rest, while the Group of Eight’s Sky Dragon snored. He seemed unafraid of anything, it was as if even the heavens couldn’t disturb his sleep.</p>
 <p>Broken Blade’s briefing was very complicated, but this fellow also occasionally inserted various cultural references in an attempt to make Yang Chen think he was very smart. Anyway, Yang Chen was still able to roughly understand why the Dragon Group painstakingly roped him into this mission.</p>
 <p>The mission was to intercept a bunch of people who were trying to smuggle the Tibetan Buddhism’s Vairocana Dharma Body out of Huaxia.</p>
 <p>According to the Tibetan Buddhism’s doctrine, the Vairocana Dharma Body holds an integral part in the people’s faith, and only the teachings by Vairocana is considered orthodox. Without the golden statue which bore the power of countless living buddhas from ancient times, there would be no way for the Tibetan Buddhism followers to verify the authenticity of the Dalai Lama.</p>
 <p>[TL: The raws say the ruler of Tibet but I’m guessing it’s referring to the Dalai Lama. I do not know much about buddhism and of tibet so do correct me if you see a mistake!]</p>
 <p>In an area where religion was emphasised, the loss of this item of faith would throw the whole region into chaos.</p>
 <p>The importance of territory need not be explained!</p>
 <p>However, the situation this time was extremely special, for the ones trafficking the Vairocana Dharma Body was none other than an elder in Tibetan Buddhism, the High Lama Dan Zeng!</p>
 <p>High Lama Dan Zeng wasn’t the type that taught buddhism or a traditional monk that sits in meditation to reach enlightenment. He was the inheritor of many strange Tibetan Buddhist martial arts and techniques, and he himself was a warrior monk with great achievements.</p>
 <p>It would be fine if it was just High Lama Dan Zeng, as the Dragon Group could just intercept and surround him. They’d definitely be able to secure victory and take the Vairocana Dharma Body back.</p>
 <p>However, this betrayal was accompanied by the four Dharmarajas who had a great relationship with High Lama Dan Zeng. They were Great Treasure, Great Vehicle, Great Wisdom, Great Compassion. They were all experts in Tantric Buddhism, had profound cultivation, and were on par with High Lama Dan Zeng.</p>
 <p>These five powerful Tantric Buddhist monks had planned to steal the Dharma Body out of the country. If it wasn’t because the Dragon Group had been keeping tabs on them and noticed their treachery, it would truly be too late to stop them!</p>
 <p>One could say that they can’t withstand the might of powerful modern weapons and heavy arms, but the Vairocana Dharma Body they possess mustn’t be damaged at all! Besides, once they activate the army, this incident might blow up and be known throughout the world.</p>
 <p>Therefore, there was no other choice than to make a sudden ambush by a small team to retrieve the Vairocana Dharma Body.</p>
 <p>After hearing all that Broken Blade had to say, Yang Chen doubtfully asked, “These bald donkeys have nothing better to do other than eat? Why are they trying to smuggle a religious relic out of the country?”</p>
 <p>Broken Blade snorted and said, “Tibet has always been a constant worry in Huaxia’s eyes. These aren’t the first evil rebels who went against the law. They are definitely thinking of a way to let Tibet break away from Huaxia, and gain autonomous power over the region. Therefore, such actions from them isn’t strange at all.”</p>
 <p>“Where are they now?”</p>
 <p>“They’ve already been encircled at the Dan River, and are currently hiding within an old abandoned Buddhist temple. We had fought them before, and forced them to retreat, so they will stay put for now. However, the units in the area aren’t the elite special forces, so we had Abbess Yun Miao and her disciple watch them as an empty fort strategy. Due to the terrain, the enemy doesn’t have any mode of transport, so there will be no problem for now, but this won’t drag on for long.” Said Broken Blade.</p>
 <p>Hearing the name “Abbess Yun Miao,” Yang Chen found it familiar. He pondered over this name and asked, “Is that the Abbess Yun Miao who is the oldest member of the Group of Eight?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, looks like you do have an understanding of the Yellow Flame Iron Brigade’s structure, Sir Pluto.” Broken Blade proudly smiled.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen furrowed his brows, “Counting Abbess Yun Miao in, there’s already nine of you. Don’t tell me that you’re still afraid of those five bald donkeys?”</p>
 <p>“There wouldn’t just be five enemies.” Bigfoot who had his eyes closed suddenly interjected.</p>
 <p>Broken Blade continued on, “Sir Pluto, do you know where they intend to smuggle the Dharma Body to?”</p>
 <p>“Where?”</p>
 <p>“The USA.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen immediately understood the reason for everything now. He rubbed his head like he had a headache, “Don’t tell me that the people from Blue Storm are coming.”</p>
 <p>“According to reliable intelligence from the headquarters, the USA’s Blue Storm has already dispatched at least four of their secret agents to receive the monks. Right now, there has been no news as to whether they have snuck past our blockade, but if they are really here, we might not even have a way to find out. Sir Pluto should be very clear that in terms of technological advances, Blue Storm is the undisputed number one in the world. If they show up, considering the strength of Blue Storm’s agents, we will have a problem despite having our core team of nine members because Leaf and Tsunami aren’t battle-type operatives, so our odds of victory are miniscule.” Broken Blade’s tone became serious, which was rare.</p>
