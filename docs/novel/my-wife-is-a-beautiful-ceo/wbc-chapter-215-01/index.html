 <p>Chapter 215-1: When</p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kunshan Village. Mo Qianni sat on the wooden steps by the doorway with her cellphone in hand, staring at the entrance with a depressed expression while seemingly mumbling something……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damned Yang Chen, stinking Yang Chen, don’t you know to give me a few more calls? You said that you’re coming back soon, yet you still aren’t back, are you trying to kill me with worry so that you can look for another lover? Damned Yang Chen, stinking Yang Chen… why are you not back yet…… Nothing could possibly happen right? I’ll give you three seconds, you had better appear in front of me when I count to one…… Three… two… nevermind, you’re definitely throwing a tantrum, even if I count to one, you intentionally won’t show up……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Guifang walked out of the kitchen with a plate of white rice. There were already three dishes and a soup, which was normal in a peasant family on the table. Seeing her daughter talking to herself by the doorway, she couldn’t help but laugh and say, “Ni-zi, what are you mumbling on about there? Hasn’t Son-in-law Yang already given you a call? Let’s eat first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom!” Mo Qianni stood up and anxiously said, “How could you be so relaxed? What happened was incredibly strange, why do you seem to not be worried about Yang Chen at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Guifang happily clicked her tongue several times and said, “Look at my daughter, she hasn’t returned for over ten years, yet the moment she does she’s already lecturing her mother because of a man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not what I meant… I’m trying to say that……”　</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.” Ma Guifang smiled and said, “I know you’re anxious, I’m anxious as well, but there’s one thing Mom learned all these years. When it comes to matters in this world, there’s no point panicking, what we need to do is to live well at home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni understood what she meant, but it was difficult for her to calm herself down. She slowly walked to the table and sat down, then slowly began to eat the rice Ma Guifang served to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Guifang didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry, “Ni-zi, eat more veggies, why are you just eating white rice without any dishes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom……” Mo Qianni put down her chopsticks, looked up and said, “I’m not eating anymore, I’ll go to the village entrance to wait for Yang Chen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Child, why are you so obstinate? I’ve already told you that whether you wait or panic, the outcome is the same.” Ma Guifang dotingly persuaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni shook her head, “It’s not the same. I hope that when Yang Chen returns, the first person he sees is me. I hope he sees me waiting for him and worrying about him, so that when he is out and going through dangerous situations, he will know that there is someone waiting for him to return. I believe that will make him happier than seeing me eating peacefully here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Guifang was stunned while Mo Qianni stood up and headed for the door.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This silly girl……</span></i><span style> Ma Guifang murmured in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right as Mo Qianni was about to open the main door, the door which wasn’t locked suddenly opened from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen saluted her with a smile, “Little Qianqian, there’s no need to go to the entrance, it’s so far away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he looked at her longing face that was close to turning into torture, Mo Qianni felt resentful, and felt like giving him a slap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she was about to smack Yang Chen with her hand, she changed her action to hooking his neck with her arm. Mo Qianni’s soft and light body stuck onto Yang Chen, her head rested against Yang Chen’s chest, and they stayed in that position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen hugged Mo Qianni’s waist, he enjoyed the the warmness and softness of it very much. He rubbed Mo Qianni’s back, and lightly patted her. With a smile he said, “Alright, Mother-in-law is still waiting for us. Haven’t I already returned? If you cry, she’d think that I’ve been bullying you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni looked up and released her arms around Yang Chen’s neck, with moist red eyes she said, “You did bully me! You left without a word and only left a note, and your phone couldn’t even be contacted. You were trying to make me worry about you, so you were intentionally bullying me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The situation is rather complicated, but I definitely didn’t make you worry on purpose.” Yang Chen said with a forced smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care, you have to compensate me.” Mo Qianni angrily said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Compensate? How?” Asked Yang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Qianni cutely took a few deep breaths, then suddenly closed in and pressed her luscious red cherry lips against Yang Chen’s lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being faced with this beautiful woman’s sudden attack, Yang Chen was stunned for a moment, then began to respond with pleasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For half a day, which wasn’t really long or short, Mo Qianni had been concerned for Yang Chen. It had been weighing on her the entire time, and it truly wasn’t a pleasant feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was afraid that something happened to Yang Chen, and that her feelings for him that she hasn’t revealed may never have the opportunity to be expressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, when Yang Chen finally returned safely and she smelled his familiar smell, Mo Qianni was overwhelmed with passion and ended up acting on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the moist and teary kiss, Mo Qianni was more upfront and daring than ever before, as if she wanted to express all of the thoughts and feelings she built up during this time to Yang Chen with this kiss.</span></p>
