 <p><span class="hidden-text">Support the translator by reading My Wife is a Beautiful CEO on volarenovels.com ! Thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ruoxi was stunned, her expression went through various changes, and at the end she listlessly turned away, “I can’t do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly. I can’t say it either, so there’s no reason for us to be hung up on this matter. The reason I did what I did today was because I had to fulfill my role as a husband. As for how much feelings are involved, I’m not sure either. Therefore, you need not brood over this.” Yang Chen said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite what Yang Chen said, when Lin Ruoxi looked at Yang Chen’s disorderly clothes and messy hair, she felt warm inside. What she deemed to be utterly filthy before was now so comforting in a different perspective.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He rushed over the moment he reached home because he was worried about me……</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although there was no way she could tell him that she loves him, he also couldn’t tell her that. However, Lin Ruoxi was very content with being able to feel his concern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lin Ruoxi walked over to her Bentley, she inserted her hand into her bag to fish for the car key, but she couldn’t find it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Chen, my car key is gone!” Lin Ruoxi anxiously said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen mysteriously smiled and raised his hand, the Bentley key was dangling from his fingers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… why did you steal my car key!” Lin Ruoxi had a bad premonition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tonight I’ll drive your car, it’s more sweet for us to go home in one car, and we can become closer. Let’s strive to be able to say those three words to each other, hehe……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need to! Return me my keys!” Said Lin Ruoxi as she walked up to seize it back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how could Yang Chen let Lin Ruoxi take it? He ran circles around the car, leaving Lin Ruoxi breathless without any success of catching up to Yang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will not get on a car you drive! Return me my keys!” Lin Ruoxi obstinately stated, she didn’t want to have nightmares because from being his passenger again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen ignored her. He minded his own business as he opened the door, sat inside, closed the door, and started the engine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing outside, Lin Ruoxi was so angered that she nearly stomped on the ground. She clenched her teeth and glared at Yang Chen, the favorable impression and warmness that had accumulated just a while ago had been completely obliterated! </span><i><span style>This man is too vile! Does he think that every person is as crazy as him who drives at 200km/h in the city center like they’re strolling on the streets!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen “gentlemanly” opened the passenger door for Lin Ruoxi and reacted to Lin Ruoxi’s fuming face with a laugh, “Dear, quickly come in, it isn’t good to waste fuel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will go in if you come out!” Lin Ruoxi firmly refused to compromise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen looked at the clock in the car, “Look, it’s already past twelve midnight, other couples would have already fired three or four rounds by now. We should be going back now, be good, don’t throw your temper at your hubby, come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ruoxi had been secretly reading material related to men and women, so she knew what Yang Chen meant. She was so shy that her face blushed, and she said, “Don’t try to act rogue! Get off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so disobedient? I’ll count to three, if you don’t get on, I’ll just drive off!” Yang Chen threatened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ruoxi coldly snorted and refused to budge from where she stood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen frowned, then began to count, “One… two… two and a half, two and a half and a half’s half…… Two and a half and a half’s half and a half’s half’s half……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teehee……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ruoxi couldn’t help laughing. The pent-up frustrations this night seemed to have been swept all swept away by Yang Chen’s weird counting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’re happy now? If you’re happy then get on, you can’t actually be here to keep counting till hundreds of halfs, right?” Yang Chen asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ruoxi rolled her eyes at him. Although she was nervous inside, she still got into the car, and warned Yang Chen, “You’re not allowed to drive recklessly. Drive slowly, or else I really won’t sit in a car that you drive anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry.” Yang Chen wasn’t planning to drive too quickly. Lin Ruoxi had already been through a lot tonight, he wasn’t an inconsiderate person who only cared about having fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the car stably got onto the highway, Yang Chen thought of something and asked Lin Ruoxi, “Tomorrow, I am going to a friend’s birthday party so I won’t be going to work. I’m letting you know so that you don’t think I’m skiving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Birthday party?” Lin Ruoxi put on a cold expression and asked, “It’s the birthday of one of ur women outside, right? Why say friend, there’s no need to hide it from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen sighed and said, “If I was really going for a woman’s birthday party, then I wouldn’t dare tell you. My friend’s name is Yuan Ye, I’m not sure if you know him, he seems pretty wealthy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Yuan Ye!?” It seemed like Lin Ruoxi didn’t dare believe what she just heard, “It’s Yuan Ye from the Yuan Family!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[TL: I previously tled Yuan Ye as Yuanye, but Yuan is actually his family name so it’s Yuan Ye from now on!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Chen wasn’t sure so he replied, “I don’t know, but he seems wealthy. He drives an Audi R8, and has a pro gaming team. I became familiar with him by playing games.”　　</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ruoxi became even more shocked. She found Yang Chen’s words to be too inconceivable, “Do you know that the Yuan Family is number one in Zhonghai in terms of power? Yuan Ye is the Yuan Family’s only child. The Xu Family where Xu Zhihong is from cannot even compare to half of the Yuan Family’s might.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Yang Chen found this information rather fresh, “Looks like I should get closer to that brat so that Xu Zhihong can’t create trouble for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ruoxi nodded, seemingly in deep thought, “Yeah, you should play more games witn Yuan Ye in the future and try to become closer to him. Since he likes having you as a friend, then you should take this opportunity become acquainted with the Yuan Family, it will aid your future prospects greatly. This can’t do, when you go tomorrow, I will send someone to help you get presents. When you go over and meet the seniors in the Yuan Family, you have to be polite. Especially to Yuan Ye’s mother, I heard that she’s from a family in Yanjing much more powerful than the Yuan Family, you have to be prepared and leave a good impression.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Lin Ruoxi’s sudden meticulous planning to create connections so as to build a good career path for him, Yang Chen silently sighed. </span><i><span style>I just wanted to play some games, is it so difficult!?</span></i></p>
