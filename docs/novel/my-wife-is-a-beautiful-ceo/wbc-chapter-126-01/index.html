 <p>As a honorable breakfast-buying staff, Yang Chen felt that it was very impolite for the ladies not to get into formation and welcome him. He was even more curious as to what the ladies were discussing. Therefore, after putting down the breakfast he had brought, he moved towards Liu Mingyu’s desk to join them.</p>
 <p>The sharp-eyed Zhao Hongyan noticed Yang Chen walking over, so she waved, beckoning him, “Yang Chen, come over here and congratulate Mingyu-jie, let us hear some auspicious words.”</p>
 <p>“What am I congratulating her for?” Yang Chen happily asked.</p>
 <p>“Mingyu-jie has been promoted to be our Public Relations Department’s Head. How’s that, amazing, right?” A pretty girl said with glee.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen was rather taken aback, and looked at Liu Mingyu who was surrounded by the ladies. She seemed to have a helpless and bashful expression, but her pair of beautiful eyes still exuded the joy inside her heart.</p>
 <p>“This is indeed worth congratulating.” Yang Chen said as he pointed at the bags of breakfast he had bought, “Luckily, I had foresight and bought two tea eggs for breakfast as well, yep… as a congratulatory gift specifically prepared for Department Head Liu.”</p>
 <p>The ladies all coquettishly protested Yang Chen’s shamelessness. <i>What kind of congratulatory gift is this? What’d a girl need two eggs for?</i></p>
 <p>Liu Mingyu wasn’t used to such superstar-like treatment. After getting up to thank her fellow sisters, she implored everybody to return to their seats, so as to not hold up working hours.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen curiously asked, “Mingyu-jie, since you’ve become the Department Head, what’s going to happen to Department Head Mo? Is she getting fired?”</p>
 <p>Liu Mingyu rolled her eyes at him, “What drivel are you spouting, Department Head Mo has obviously been promoted to an even higher post.”</p>
 <p>“What position?”</p>
 <p>“It seems to be because the Finance Department’s Department Head Ma had resigned, citing his age as the reason. Department Head Mo has now directly taken up the position as the head of the Finance Department. Furthermore, because of her exceptional performance during the CEO’s period of hospitalization, the board of directors unanimously approved Department Head Mo to hold the position of Vice-CEO concurrently. The one and only Vice-CEO in the whole of Yu Lei International, y’know? The overseas branches only have a director as their peak position!” It was unknown as to when did Zhang Cai acquire a red bean bun from the bags of breakfasts, she spoke while gnawing on the bun.</p>
 <p><i>Department Head Ma took the initiative to resign citing age as the reason!? </i>Yang Chen felt cheery, how could it be that that old fellow resigned for that reason? Yang Chen gave Liu Mingyu, who was beside him, a profound look, and sure enough, the latter’s pretty face slightly blushed and she looked away.</p>
 <p>But this is fine as well, it wouldn’t be awkward if they were to bump into each other in the company in the future.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, within the period of slightly more than a month that Yang Chen had been here, both Liu Mingyu and Mo Qianni had been promoted. Mo Qianni was now directly holding two high posts. This made Yang Chen feel like he had the potential to be a bringer of good luck.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment, that Mo Qianni, who donned a silver-gray suit, had walked in. She looked particularly well-dressed today, her head of beautiful hair was neatly combed without a single hair out of place into the shape of a bun. She had her contact lenses off, and instead had a pair of ordinary yet elegant gold-rimmed eyeglasses on. On her tender snow-white neck hung a resplendent platinum necklace chain. Her black stockings coupled with her silver-gray colored high-heeled shoes caused her jade-like legs to seem extraordinarily delicate and enticing. While still being confident and enchanting, she now exuded a more feminine impression.</p>
 <p>All of the ladies in the Public Relations Department quietened down as they watched Mo Qianni enter the office with looks of reverence and well-wishes. It was apparent that at an age prior to thirty, she had the ability to climb up to the second highest seat of a listed company. In the hearts of these young ladies, Mo Qianni had an incredibly enviable halo on her.</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni swept her gaze over everyone. When her gaze landed on Yang Chen and Liu Mingyu, it paused for a moment, and she displayed a rarely seen warm and gentle smile, “Mingyu, you’ve received the promotion notice by now, right?”</p>
 <p>Touched, Liu Mingyu nodded, “Thank you, Department Head.”</p>
 <p>“You need not thank me, everybody knows of your track record. All I did was make a customary recommendation to the board of directors. In addition, from this day on, you’re also someone of the Department Head-level, and you have entered the higher echelons of the company. You need not act so prudent.” Mo Qianni gently smiled, and some of the other ladies also showed amiable smiles.</p>
 <p>Liu Mingyu nodded, with rather moist eyes she said, “In the two to three years I’ve been in the company, many people have been skeptical of me and backstabbed me, but you, Department Head Mo, have always believed in me and never brought any of this up. I’m truly grateful. I know that you’ve done a lot for us, but just chose not to mention it.”</p>
 <p>A number of the ladies also nodded in approval to those words. It seemed that they had also been looked after by Mo Qianni. In this business world that is filled by strong undercurrents, these ladies were helpless in many ways. A superior who was willing to protect their rights was one worthy of their support and respect.</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni didn’t accept this praise as she smiled and said, “That’s no big deal, our Yu Lei International is a company headed by women, if we don’t help each other, it wouldn’t be possible for us to be what we are today. These are the teachings of the previous CEO, I hope that all of you will remember them too.”</p>
 <p>The PR ladies nodded, they restrained their usual appearance of fun and laughter, and listened earnestly.</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni looked at everyone with a satisfied expression, then said to Liu Mingyu, “Mingyu, I’m going to pack up my things in the office. An hour later, come over to my office. I’ll hand over my work to you. You should pack up your current desk as well. In the afternoon, the CEO will personally look for you for a chat, don’t be too nervous about it, it’s just for her to get to know you.”</p>
 <p>After delegating several matters, Mo Qianni was about to enter her office. At this time, a rather young lady in the office asked with reddened eyes, “Department Head Mo, will you still return and visit us?”</p>
 <p>Mo Qianni came to a halt, and stared blankly where she was, unable to get a word out.</p>
