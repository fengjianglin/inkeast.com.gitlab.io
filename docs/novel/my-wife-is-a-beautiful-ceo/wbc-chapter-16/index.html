 <p>Chapter 16: The Father-in-Law Appears</p>
 <p>Startled by Yang Chen’s sudden appearance, Lin Ruoxi jumped from the sofa and struggled to escape from his arms. She glared at Yang Chen: “You are not allowed to touch me.”</p>
 <p>“Hey now… You don’t have to overreact that much.” Yang Chen grimaced while shrugging his shoulders. “I was just teasing you. If I actually kissed you, I’m sure in the middle of the night I’d be hacked into pieces like in the movie Psycho.”</p>
 <p>Lin Ruoxi ignored Yang Chen as she pressed a button on the TV remote. As the TV turned off, her face began blushing knowing that Yang Chen has now figured out her guilty pleasure of watching Rom-Coms. She gave Yang Chen an angry look: “I heard from Wang Ma that you went to pack up your old belongings. Don’t you dare bring those dirty things into my house.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, it’s just a few articles of clothing,” Yang Chen replied while pointing toward a small bag at the foot of the stairs. “Though, my greatest woe is that after living here, what will happen to my mutton skewer stand?”</p>
 <p>“You still want to open your stand!?!” Lin Ruoxi growled as she looked at Yang Chen as if she was staring at a freak. No matter how much she tried to understand him, she could never understand his obsession with selling mutton skewers.</p>
 <p>Blinking his eyes, Yang Chen replied “What of it? &nbsp;Our marriage contract didn’t bar me from selling mutton skewers right?”</p>
 <p>Gnashing her teeth, Lin Ruoxi responded: “In no way would I allow you to sell your mutton skewers. Tomorrow, you must go out and find a job, preferably a respectable job in an office building.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen scratched his head while looking perplexed. To be honest, with a degree from Harvard University, which he easily obtained, it would be very easy for him to enter a majority of the top companies, but he is not used to sitting in an office with AC. In his eyes, this type of career could never match the joy of selling mutton skewers on the street.</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to think of an excuse, this is mandatory.” Interjected Lin Ruoxi.</p>
 <p>Looking at Ruoxi’s “if you don’t switch your job, you’re dead” gaze while remembering her previous suicide threat, Yang Chen felt a sudden cold sweat and quickly consented “Okay okay… I’ll listen to you. Tomorrow, I’ll go and find a new job.”</p>
 <p>Hearing these words, Ruoxi approvingly nodded. Appearing to suddenly remember something, she took out her bag and retrieved a new smart phone from it. Handing it to Yang Chen, she said: “Here, take this phone in case I can’t find you when you go out.”</p>
 <p>Yang Chen excitedly received the phone. Seems like this is a profitable marriage: &nbsp;A mansion, a sports car, and even a free phone. Even though this wife looks a bit distant, she is very attractive and well-mannered.</p>
 <p>Looking at Yang Chen’s blissful expression, Ruoxi couldn’t do anything other than to give him a contempt look. Stifling a yawn, while making a tired stretching pose, she said: “Well, I’m off to bed. You can go prepare for tomorrow’s job hunt.”</p>
 <p>Just as Ruoxi started climbing up the stairs, the doorbell suddenly rang.</p>
 <p>Wang Ma, who was busy in the kitchen, dashed out while wiping her wet hands on her apron, and opened the door.</p>
 <p>“Master, you’ve come…”</p>
 <p>Hearing Wang Ma saying Master, Ruoxi’s face suddenly became pale as she elegantly turned around to look at the middle-aged man walking into the house.</p>
 <p>The mature man wore a dark blue shirt while giving off a refined aura with his well-shaved beard. The only way you could tell his age was by the wrinkles near his eyes, and the countless strands of white hair. One can clearly tell that he is Ruoxi’s father from his appearance alone.</p>
 <p>At the same moment Lin Kun entered from the door, his expression became extremely ugly. Giving dagger-looks at Ruoxi, he quickly swept his gaze around and glanced at Yang Chen.</p>
 <p>“Father…” Ruoxi weakly called out. His arrival didn’t garner much surprise. It was almost as if he was a stranger without any feelings.</p>
 <p>“Father?” Lin Kun coldly laughed: “In your eyes, do you even see me as one? Without any warning, you just married this strange brute. Do you even see me as a father?”</p>
 <p>Lin Kun’s roar caused the whole room to shake and echo.</p>
 <p>Wang Ma, standing at the wrong place and time, was scared silly. Never would she have expected that her young Miss would marry someone without informing her father.</p>
 <p>Ruoxi’s eyes began to turn red as tears started welling up inside. However, she fought back, saying, “As I’ve said before, my marriage is my decision. So what if he is a brute? I would rather marry this guy than Xu Zhihong.”</p>
 <p>“You… Is this how you talk to your father?” &nbsp;Lin Kun sneered: “Great, what a waste raising you up. Don’t ever think that just because your grandmother gave you the company, I can’t educate you on what to do! Don’t forget, I still have 30% of the shares in the company. I am a major stockholder. Even more importantly, I am your biological father!”</p>
 <p>“Father?” Ruoxi bit her lips and wept: “Ever since I was little, only mother and grandma was by my side. I never even caught a glimpse of your shadow back then. Furthermore, I don’t like Xu Zhihong at all. You don’t have to waste your time thinking about this.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t like him? So what? It wouldn’t hurt to be engaged to the next CEO of the Donghua Science &amp; Technology Co. And are you telling me that you actually like this brute?” Lin Kun said while pointing at Yang Chen who was standing still.</p>
 <p>From the moment Lin Kun entered till the father-daughter conversation, Yang Chen understood most of what was going on, it seemed like it was because of this ill-tempered father’s forcing, that Lin Ruoxi had chosen to marry him. But of course, the series of unfortunate events which led to their man-woman relationship is a big reason that caused this marriage too.</p>
 <p>Being called a “brute” more than once, even the heart of a clay Buddha would feel uncomfortable. Yang Chen, who had not taken the role of that man’s son-in-law, looked at Lin Kun’s finger and said “Uncle, I advise you to put down your finger. It might be dangerous.”</p>
 <p>Lin Kun sneered, “You prick, even you are talking back to me? I’m aware of who you are! I have already assigned people to investigate clearly. You’re just a wet market’s mutton skewer vendor. Even though I don’t know what you did to my daughter to make her marry you, but in my eyes you are just a pile of shit…Hey! What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>In a flash, Lin Kun, who was acting all high and mighty, suddenly pulled his finger back in pain. Holding his finger, you could see droplets of sweat rolling down his forehead.</p>
 <p>“Yang Chen… You…” Ruoxi had seen it clearly. Yang Chen’s hand had instantaneously shot out and pinched Lin Kun’s extended finger. And then he pulled his finger back so quickly that it seemed as if he didn’t move at all.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen showed a calm expression, and he turned to Ruoxi while grinning: “It’s nothing serious, I just don’t like it when people point fingers and curse at me. Especially when I already advised them not to. His finger is broken. It’ll take around 10 days to a month to heal.”</p>
 <p>If it was the previous him, just now, that man would have had his head broken.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Lin Kun resisted the pain and roared “Just you wait bastard. I won’t let you die a peaceful death. I will find somebody to deal with you…”</p>
 <p>“Father… Stop talking… What happened to your hand…” Although Ruoxi hated her father, blood is thicker than water. At this moment, looking at Lin Kun’s painful expression, Ruoxi’s heart soften as she squatted down to help support him.</p>
 <p>“You slut! Don’t touch me!” Lin Kun screamed as he suddenly pushed aside Ruoxi, throwing her down on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Father! You…” &nbsp;Ruoxi’s complexion turned pale, as she could not believe that her father would actually call her a slut. &nbsp;Ruoxi’s eyes grew dimmer as she is about to faint.</p>
 <p>In the corner, Wang Ma was already in tears, but this was not her place for a servant to speak up. However, upon seeing Ruoxi on the ground crying, she quickly went up to console her.</p>
 <p>Lin Kun hobbled back up as he glared at Yang Chen. “Youngster, remember how you hit me. I, Lin Kun, will make sure you are unable to comprehend your death!!”</p>
 <p>Noticing Ruoxi who was thrown off to the side, Yang Chen felt his heart being clenched involuntarily. No matter how cold she may be, on pen and paper, she was still Yang Chen’s legal wife. Anger started welling up inside of him.</p>
 <p>While Yang Chen’s face seemed tranquil, only his lips betrayed his demeanor, with them arcing up showing a contemptuous look.</p>
 <p>“I’ll only say this once. I never go around looking for trouble. I don’t know what happened between you and my wife, and I don’t care to know. But I have a principle. I hate being threatened.”</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Lin Kun’s reaction, a lightning-fast palm struck onto Lin Kun’s left cheek.</p>
 <p>“Pa!!!”</p>
 <p>The whole living room became deadly silent as the crisp sound started echoing around. Just then, the recently standing Lin Kun got slapped unconscious with a single hit.</p>
 <p>“Young Master…about this…” Wang Ma stammered as she didn’t notice Yang Chen’s outrageous strength. “How should we deal with this? Look at this commotion.”</p>
 <p>As for Ruoxi, she had already collapsed in Wang Ma’s embrace as she looked at these past events with not even a trace of concern.</p>
 <p>Yang Chen said in an indifferent tone: “Wang Ma, just take care of Ruoxi. Let me deal with this stupid pig.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Yang Chen picked Lin Kun from the ground and dragged him out of the house. After having walked a short distance, Yang Chen arrived at the dumpster site, lightly threw Lin Kun into it, and subsequently closed the iron lid.</p>
