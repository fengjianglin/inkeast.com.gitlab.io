 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to check. It’s dead.” Ning Xuemo stated. Her little face looked somewhat pale as she sat on a branch of a big tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like the few provocations she used earlier had consumed most of her strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although what she said sounded careless, her tone carried complete certainty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Number Two could become Ji Yunhao’s closest guard, it implied that he also possessed real skills and a quick mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he immediately understood. “This cluster of brambles is poisonous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he remembered that those brambles had little toxicity. When pierced by the thorns it would cause scorching pain, but it was far from being deadly. Could it be that poison from the thorns is the Flying Dragon Centipede’s bane?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The uncertainty of the situation bewildered him. Subconsciously, he wanted to go down there to investigate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t believe that it dropped dead like that, you can go down and check.” Ning Xuemo spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two stopped his steps. He lifted his head to look at Ning Xuemo. She sat on a branch, her legs swinging in the air. She looked three parts careless, six parts relaxed, and one part serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you put poison in that thicket of brambles?” Number Two guessed and was 80% correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo shook the branch and smiled. “If your master was here, would you still try to inquire about the situation to get to the bottom of it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two choked. If his master was here, he would certainly not ask about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He cupped his hands. “Pardon me. This subordinate has exceeded his place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo bent her neck to the side, staring at him. Suddenly, she started laughing. “The truth is I wasn’t seriously complaining about you. Any place that often had food big and vicious creatures loved most likely also contained their nemesis. Earlier, I was trying find its nemesis. As expected, I found several trees containing sap growing on the hillside where a certain type of mole dwelled. That place had many traces of the centipede. With its huge body, it devastated the environment into a hideous mess. This is proof that it often came there to hunt. However, there were several undamaged trees and plants. It was clearly evident that those trees and plants were its nemesis. Therefore, I smeared the juice and sap from those plants and trees on the thorns of the brambles…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two repeatedly gasped. “You still took some risks. If by any chance those trees and plants were not effectives, you ignorantly returning and provoking that centipede would certainly damn you! You shouldn’t have come back…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I didn’t come back to you, would it have dropped dead? I will not abandon any of my comrades.” She once again crooked her head and sized him up. “Even though you being a comrade was uncalled for, you secretly protected me the whole way after all.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Comrade?’ </span></i><span style>She surprisingly considered him a comrade?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two’s heart warmed. People like him are often considered as cannon fodder or disposable meat shields by their masters. This was the first time he was considered as a comrade because of protecting someone...</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart seemed to surge with hot blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, he was dispatched to protect Ning Xuemo in the dark, and somewhere inside his heart, he felt aggrieved over having to protect a waste. At present however, his grievances turned into feelings of thankfulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A radiance flickered inside his eyes. Once again, he bowed to Ning Xuemo. His heart had already decided. He pledged his life to protect Miss Ning and assist her, not because it was his mission, but because of the kindness she showed by recognizing his worth...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Ning, where do you plan to go next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo blinked. She replied with something irrelevant, “I’m hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two immediately responded, “Miss Ning, please wait for this subordinate to go hunt some food!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already afternoon. Although they were high above the sea level, the ardent sun shining out there could not warm the dense jungle, leaving the place they stood completely cool and refreshing.</span></p>
