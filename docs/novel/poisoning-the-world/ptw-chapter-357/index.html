 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Number One’s expression changed slightly. He already had suspicions that Number Two had met with misfortune, but he was holding onto hope. Unfortunately, at this moment, the truth was confirmed by Ning Xuemo. The look within his eyes turned gloomy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The golden-eyed eagle? How could that beast catch him? You went to the 9th Peak?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for you to know more about it.” Ning Xuemo did not want to tell him about her fortuitous encounter. As she recalled matters about Number Two, her tone turned sad. “He’s dead, that’s the absolute truth! I couldn’t save him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number One slightly swayed, then like a shooting javelin, he immediately clasped his hands, “Many thanks, Marquis Ning, for informing me. This matter… This humble one will personally investigate. I hope that Marquis Ning would not mention about this humble one disturbing you to the sixth prince.” He turned around and was prepared to leave the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually hid from Ji Yunyao his visit here. Seeing that he and Number two’s relationship was not shallow, Ning Xuemo decided to ask, “Are you Number Two’s friend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is my younger brother!” Number One answered. His eyes suddenly landed on Xijue who stood on the side, “May I ask who is that young man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who I am has nothing to do with you!” Xijue coldly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number One became gloomy as he glanced at Xijue. “Your appearance is quite similar to my younger brother. But… He is not as young as you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue’s voice turned colder, “In this world, it isn’t rare that some people might resemble one another. Let me make it clear that you and your brother have no relationship with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Related or not, I will investigate it.” Number One threw out the words before he flew out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two originally had no relatives and family, but he had a sworn brother, just like those brothers she had in her previous world. Ning Xuemo felt somewhat relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time Ning Xuemo was done cultivating, her body would be smelly and sweaty, thus she had to take a bath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xijue, you can take a rest.” Ning Xuemo got up and walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you save me because I look like Number Two?” Xijue’s voice drifted from behind her. His tone was slightly cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s one of the reasons.” Ning Xuemo answered. On that day, she did her best to save him due to his face. If he wasn’t similar in appearance to Number Two, would she have saved him on that day?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would, right? But she might not give her best to save him neither would she harvest a heavenly ice grass for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am not him!” Xijue spoke coldly after a moment of silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know. That’s why I chose you for your face.” Ning Xuemo spoke half-jokingly, “You should be glad to have such face, since I save your life because of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ning Xuemo already stepped out of the door threshold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you like him a lot?” Xijue’s voice echoed from inside, but it was impossible to determine his mood from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I like him. In my heart, he’s like a brother, the kind that you can share life and death with.” Ning Xuemo stretched herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I his substitute?” Xijue’s voice did not sound good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At last, Ning Xuemo turned her head and looked at him. “You are overthinking. Substitute or not, you are you and he is him. You cannot replace him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this world, it goes without saying that no one can replace another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, when those words fell in Xijue’s ears, the meaning was interpreted differently. Xijue slowly clenched his fingers tightly into a fist. “I want to know, am I not as good as him?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This awkward child, did he eat something bad today?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo didn’t feel explaining herself, thus she waved her hand and said, “Xijue, you must be very tired and are overthinking. Well then, you can leave. I still need to take a bath. Tomorrow, we still need to attend that damn Garden Appreciation party… You will accompany me and must give me face tomorrow.”</span></p>
