 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The little kid was exceptionally obedient. He stayed on her back the entire time, both his hands lightly hugging Ning Xuemo’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His breathing was extremely soft, making Ning Xuemo almost unable to sense his breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And his weight was clearly lighter than other children his age, only weighing around five kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So despite Ning Xuemo carrying him on her back, she did not feel tired at all and could easily climb up the cliff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way, the two of them ran into quite a few magic beasts. The little guy was exceptionally hard-working today; without waiting for Ning Xuemo to react, he would have already acted, sending several magic techniques to crush those beasts. Those magic beasts did not even get anywhere near them before they fell dead on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo discovered that the techniques he used were different depending on the type of beast. Some lights he shot out were yellow, others white, while some were green or blue. Every single technique contained the restraining element of the magic beast he was dealing with, making the magic beasts unable to even retaliate and die after a few attacks...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, what’s your elemental attribute?” Ning Xuemo was depressed. “Wasn’t it said that all geniuses had affinity in one element, with the occasional dual element?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The few people she knew followed that principle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, Ji Yunhao possessed the metal element while Ji Yunhuang had both the wood and fire elements. As for Number Two, he had affinity with the water element...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet the techniques this little guy released came from the five elements. Furthermore, they were released very fluidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am an extraordinary person.” The child cooly answered her with this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was true, he was not a human but a ginseng spirit who had cultivated for 10,000 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little kid, come and give big sister another ginseng. I’m hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little girl, I’m older than you! Even if you call me grandpa, I might not accept you, so stop with the ‘big sister this’ and ‘big sister that’.” The child’s voice turned colder while speaking these old-fashioned words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Hahaha!</span></i><span style> of course I know that your age is more than 10,000 years old. However, who asked you to look like a child? If you have the ability then turn into an adult, then I’ll call you grandpa.” Ning Xuemo smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child pursed his lips. He did not wish to stoop down to her level, so he closed his eyes slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that one day she would call him grandpa...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! After all, we can be considered to have shared life and death together and, after knowing you for so long, I still don’t know your name. Do ginseng spirits have names?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child paused slightly before calmly speaking. “Just call me Jiuzun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiu Zun? This name sounds fancy. A human emperor is also known as ‘Jiu Wu Zhi Zun’<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>! If it was known to that old emperor, I foresee he will slap you will the crime of being disrespectful to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He can’t bother about me.” The child’s voice was still as calm as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was true, this ginseng spirit was the deity of the 9th mountain. The emperor in the human world simply didn’t know about his existence. Naturally, he would not bother about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo thought for a bit. “Then how about I just call you Little Jiu or Little Zun? I feel like calling you Little Jiu is better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Call me Jiu Zun!” On this point, the little guy would not take a single step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fine, since he insisted then she would not quarrel with him over this minor matter. “Little Jiu Zun, are you the ninth kid in your family</span><span style>?<a href="#1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>” </span><i><span style>‘Could there’s actually nine ginseng spirits?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A green vein popped out on his forehead but he spoke in a calm voice. “I have no siblings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you chose this name yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Something like that.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘No wonder!</span></i> <i><span style>Seems like this little guy is quite ambitious. To be influenced to such an extent by the human literary culture that he wanted to call himself a sovereign…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This name was very lofty and did not seem like it was a name someone would have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he was a ginseng spirit, so no matter how weird of a name he had it was not strange.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="1"></a>[1] In Ancient China, numeral are separated into Yin and Yang. Odd numbers are Yang whereas even numbers are Yin. Jiu (?) is 9 which is the highest odd numbers, while Wu (?) or five is the number which is right in the middle of 0-10. Five is considered as the right-path. So, 9 and 5 are all Yang number and represent a monarch's authority.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">[2]&nbsp;<span style>Jiu (</span><span style>?) is the Chinese word for nine. Since he is Jiu Zun, it’s like calling him Ninth Zun. Example: Some parents name their children like this like Da (?) Huang, which refers to the eldest child while Er (?) Huang refers to the second child.</span></p>
