 <p><span style>But this branch was in a perfectly healthy condition. It still had a lot of sap in it, not to mention the many leaves that covered it, causing it to be very green. Could that match in her hand really burn it?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Is this little girl anxious to the point of being muddle-headed?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little child felt his mood being uplifted while watching everything from here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She actually dared to attack him when he was at his weakest and even interrupted his cultivation, causing him to waste a year’s worth of cultivation. What’s more, she went as far as &nbsp;biting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the price she should pay for offending him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was at any other time that someone dared to offend him, they would have long turned to ashes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had actually left her some face...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-clothed child lazily leaned against the large tree as he watched Ning Xuemo scurrying around. Suddenly he felt like his long and monotonous life was not that boring any more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘How would she light it on fire?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If she could use fire-type psychokinesis then it would not be too difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his peak, he could lignite all the surrounding trees with a wave of his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this little girl was clearly a psychokinetic waste</span></p>
 <p><span style>His idea had not fully formed before he suddenly saw Ning Xuemo using one hand to hold the branch as she gently shut her eyes and took on a movement posture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment later, under the astonished gaze of the child, that branch started withering at a rate visible to the naked eye...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy suddenly narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What is this technique?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if she used demonic arts to completely drain the tree branch of all life.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This type of technique…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The expression on his handsome little face had become grave, and his lazy posture of leaning against the tree was gradually changed to an upright posture. A pondering look flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was actually just testing something. She had once drained a crystal core of its energy to the point it turned into a dry stick so she used her inner force to reproduce the same situation on the tree branch. She rushed into action as if she was </span><i><span style>treating a dead horse</span></i><span style>. As expected, the tree branch was drained to the point of turning into a dry piece of wood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leaves that were originally bursting with life had now withered. She used the match in her hand to light it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment later, a torch was fiercely burning in her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the fire was strong enough, she once again flew out. The fiercely burning torch was like a flaming sword which smashed towards the green tiger...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Boom!”</span></i><span style> The green tiger did not manage to dodge. All the fur on its body seemed as if it was covered in oil as it quickly went up in flames.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Aowuu~~”</span></i><span style> The green tiger raised its head, letting out a miserable scream. Its body collapsed as if it had been made of paper mache and, in the blink of an eye, it had been incinerated into oblivion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared at the pile of ash on the floor, somewhat stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She already saw that the tiger was afraid of fire, but she had not thought it would be this helpless against it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just one torch had managed to completely incinerate it. She had thought that she would have been able to at least get a few pieces of tiger meat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scent of burnt leaves wafted through the air, yet did not contain the expected scent of burnt meat. She did not even see any crystal core left behind...</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only one possibility for this situation to occur; It was not a real tiger, but one transformed from a technique!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>That ginseng child!’</span></i><span style> It seems like that little thing did not run away and was still here scheming against her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little thing had a really vengeful heart. He had escaped from her yet did not run away. It seems like it was still harbouring an unresigned heart and watching her secretly from somewhere...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyes flashed slightly. She circled the spot the green tiger vanished from when suddenly she stumbled. Lifting her hand, she discovered her palm dripping with fresh blood where a silver needle had managed to pierce her flesh. It shone with a faint light under the moonlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit!” She cursed in a low voice. She lifted her hand to remove the needle and took out a small bottle, seemingly about to apply medicine on the wound. However, her fingers would not stop trembling, causing her to be unable to pour out the powder. Suddenly, her legs lost their strength as she collapsed!</span></p>
