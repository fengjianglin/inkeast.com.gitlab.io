 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 314 - Do you like him? (1)</b></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Ning Xuemo felt a little embarrassed. Of course, she wouldn’t get into a confrontation over a measly favor. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>She took the opportunity to pry Ji Yunhuang’s hand off and walked away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang stared blankly at her with his mouth opened as if he wanted to say something, appearing worried about something. However, in the end, he couldn’t utter a word. After a moment, he only spoke a few words to Ning Xuemo, “Xuemo, be careful…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo didn’t turn back. She only made a waving gesture behind her back, signalling that she had understood him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, she looked at the painting that Han Shanyue had just drawn. The sight of it suddenly gripped her heart!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The painting was that of an incomplete scenery of a mountain range with numerous peaks. The peaks had all kind of different heights with their summit covered in clouds and mist. Within the encirclement of mountain peaks, there was a waterfall. Beside it, there was a terrain filled with weird shaped stones...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This… This looks just like the scenery on the 9th Peak of Heavenly Book Mountains after the protection&nbsp;barrier surrounding the lake had vanished!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lifted her eyes to look at Great Master Han Shanyue near her. From her position, his facial traits were still as obscured as before. Unexpectedly, despite their close distance, Ning Xuemo was still unable to make out what his face looked like at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thought suddenly popped into Ning Xuemo’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Great Master Han Shanyue couldn’t be a transformation of Jiu Zun, right?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The thought scared her as she couldn’t help but give a few more glances at Han Shanyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Han Shanyue didn’t spare her a glance. He only instructed her, “Grind the ink stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His palm fell on the incomplete painting. In a flash, the painting vanished into white smoke without leaving a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo asked, “Why did you destroy the painting?” She somewhat felt it was a pity. The painting had both harmony and soul in it. After looking at it for the first time, she couldn’t help taking a second look. Even after she looked at it for the second time, she had the illusion that she was sucked into the painting and stood inside it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ning Xuemo wasn’t an art critic, how could she have entered into an art trance this easily? It was such a pity that the painting was destroyed. If he gave it to her, she could still sell it for an astronomical amount of silver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s flawed.” Han Shanyue replied succinctly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assistants besides him also revealed an expression of regret. They were also painting prodigies, and could be considered as young master painters as well. For this occasion, they were invited by Great Master Han Shanyue as assistants and were extremely willing to support that great master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier they saw Han Shanyue painted and saw how his painting brush was like a soaring dragon in the sky. Under his brush, the mountains and rivers seemed to come alive. Upon seeing such a masterpiece before their very eyes, their spirits were completely enchanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was only half-finished, in their eyes, it was already an exceptional masterpiece. But, without warning, the Great Master said the painting was ruined!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t see even the slightest dot of stain or flaw anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could only assume that the two people making a racket downstairs had disturbed the great master! This caused this exceptional masterpiece to be ruined!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore they glared at Ning Xuemo with eyes full of blame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo pretended that she didn’t see them. Instead, she smiled. “Those are just small flaws. Great Master, must you need to ask for perfection?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the two assistants were already unfolding a new canvas sheet and spread it on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s movements were deft. She grind the ink stone two or three times, but then, without any reason, as if the ink stick could bite, the tips of her finger broke after barely grinding any ink. She couldn’t pull back in time and a drop of blood fell into the black ink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I grind the ink again?” Ning Xuemo knew that the one before her was a perfectionist. She resigned to the fact that he would want to throw away the ink mix with a drop of her blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No harm.” Han Shanyue raised his hand and pressed it on the ink slab.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo didn’t have the time to retract her hand as he pressed his palm on the back of her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His palm was cold like ice, causing Ning Xuemo to suddenly burst into cold shivers. She knitted her brows and was about to retract her hand...</span></p>
