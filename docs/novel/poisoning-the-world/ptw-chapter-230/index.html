 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t any essence in the fruits either.” Jiu Zun’s voice travelled from the tunnel entrance. His white silhouette flashed, and he entered in a few steps. He tossed the pair of shoes he was holding in his hand at Ning Xuemo’s feet. “Wear them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shoes were vibrant green but looked ordinary. They really weren’t like the things Jiu Zun usually took out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Ning Xuemo wasn’t too satisfied with them, it was better to wear them than walking barefoot. When she put them on, she discovered that the size fit as if they were tailor-made for her. They fit perfectly in addition to being very comfortable. Wearing them made Ning Xuemo feel like she was stepping on soft grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiu Zun, where did you get these shoes?” Ning Xuemo tested them out by walking around. The more she walked, the more comfortable they felt. They were even more comfortable than the brocade boots she had been wearing before by a manifold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We shouldn’t linger in this place for too long. Let’s go.” Jiu Zun didn’t answer her. Instead, he turned around and exited the tunnel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo followed him out. “Did you find a way out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretty much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyes lit up! With great interest she asked, “Where’s the exit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin who was behind them widened its eyes and stared at Jiu Zun. It had been stuck here for so long and had long explored every nook and cranny of this place. Not to mention the way out, it hadn’t even found a mousehole!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The insides of this stone essence spirit only consisted of the tunnel they came from as well as this wide clearing, nothing else. And from the place they had fallen into the tunnel, there was no exit either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could the number of times that the little qilin explored this place in the past thousand years be less than a thousand?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This stone essence spirit was like a </span><span style>pixiu<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span><span style>, as they could only enter but could not leave...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiu Zun’s gaze shifted over and landed on the little qilin’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin was clearly taller than him by half a head, but its demeanor was being constantly suppressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiu Zun’s gaze was icy cold, causing the little qilin to shiver. It couldn’t help but shrink back and hide behind Ning Xuemo’s back, his tiny hand holding onto a corner of her skirt, not daring to poke his head out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come here!” Jiu Zun lightly furrowed his brows. These words were clearly directed at the little qilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin’s body trembled once again as half of its face peeked out timidly from behind Ning Xuemo’s back. “Wha-what for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’re a divine beast then you should act like one! Why are you acting so cowardly? Come stand here and speak!” Jiu Zun scolded him, while his aura grew more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin felt a bit afraid of him. It didn’t want to come out, but it didn’t dare go against Jiu Zun. However, it didn’t move further than 60cm from Ning Xuemo. His small hand still gripped onto Ning Xuemo’s hem like a scared child holding onto his mother. “What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to leave with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin nodded its head as if it was pounding garlic. “Of course, of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten years!” Jiu Zun slowly spit out these two words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Ah?’</span></i><span style> The little qilin widened its eyes in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to </span><i><span style>benzun</span></i><span style>’s orders for ten years, and </span><i><span style>benzun</span></i><span style> will bring you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, the little qilin had to be his summoned beast for ten years and could only regain its freedom after this period of time had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin’s blue face flushed red. “We qilins are divine beasts; we don’t take orders from humans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve got willpower!” Jiu Zun elegantly praised. “Then you can continue staying here and eat leaves.” He pulled on Ning Xuemo’s hand. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They both started striding away in large steps. The little qilin was dazed for a moment before it pursed its lips and followed Ning Xuemo, clearly intending to follow them out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s left hand was holding onto a tough little pipsqueak while being followed closely by a blue skinned little pipsqueak. This scene made her feel amused.</span></p>

 <p><a name="1"></a>[1] A pixiu is a<span style>&nbsp;fierce divine beast which can swallow anything in the world. Anything that does in never comes back out.</span>&nbsp;It's another Chinese mythical animal that looks like the combination of different beast : dragon's head with a lion's body. It's often confuse as the qilin or other mythical animals because of some similar points. <a href="http://i3.wenshen520.com/28621_0.jpg" target="_blank">Click here for the picture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixiu" target="_blank">click here for more informations</a>.
