 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 149 - Comrades</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had treated this place like a forbidden ground, but now it seems that as long as you have the correct method of exploring! it wouldn’t be considered as terrible…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the future, as long as he wanted to pick this herb, he could bring a chicken or maybe smear his body with some chicken shit…</span></p>
 <p><span style> The only problem would be learning how to easily bypass that swarm of snakes. Even now he did not even know what scent he was splashed with, let alone how to manufacture it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be getting any ideas.” Ning Xuemo spoke, clearly seeing through his thoughts. “Normal roosters won’t work! The scent on our bodies comes from the Celestial Chicken, the natural predator of this type of scorpion…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘So it was like this!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two couldn’t help looking at her. It seems like this little fellow had not been short on preparations; Her research on this place was extremely thorough!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like this lass did not come here to gamble with her life. She already had a well-thought out plan…</span></p>
 <p><span style> As they both turned around the hillside, their eyes suddenly lit up. A wide expanse of starry ocean spread before their eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, to be exact, it was as if the stars in the sky were growing as grass below their feet..</span></p>
 <p><span style>The star-like grass was densely packed into 40 to 50 stalks. Every single stalk was about 30cm high and light blue in colour. The leaves were rounded, moist and thick. A layer of silvery-white speckled the leaves, making them shine like little stars. Under the light of the fading dusk, they glimmered faintly while exuding waves of a refreshing scent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Heavenly Ice Grass! I didn’t expected there were so many stalks here!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two’s eyes lit up and he was ready to dash forwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ning Xuemo halted his footsteps with a gesture. Then she took out a short blade which shone with crimson light. “Take out your weapons!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two was startled. Was she thinking about fighting him for the herbs?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Ning rest assured. All the herbs here are yours, this one would not ask for even a single stalk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo rolled her eyes. “Cut the crap! Take out your blade so I can smear drugs on it! There are different types of snakes and scorpions which live in this grass and they can only be killed by a special drug!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘So it was like this!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two sighed in relief as he gave his sword to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo took out a transparent medicinal paste and applied it on the edge of the blade before returning it to him. “Don’t use it too excessively, I only have so much. Remember, only take one stalk of grass each before retreating! Don’t get greedy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She spoke in an imposing manner. Number Two was stunned for a moment. “This one- This humble one can also take a stalk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course! Since we have stumbled upon a mountain of treasures, how can you return empty-handed? This herb can help you improve a bit your physique. After harvesting, immediately swallow the leaves. Remember, don’t eat the stem. You must not forget this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two’s heart was very touched as he spoke softly. “Many thanks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Chang Kong Country, no matter what treasures guards found, they all belonged to the master. Even if it was a large patch of herbs, the master would monopolise it all, without giving them anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was unless they had performed some great merit, in which case the master might award them a bit…</span></p>
 <p><span style>And right now, for some reason, despite only being able to pick two stalks, Ning Xuemo surprisingly would let him have one stalk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For this kind of girl, even if he were to die for her sake, it would be hard to repay her kindness!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two breathed out as he spoke. “Miss Ning, can only two stalks be picked? This one doesn’t want it, it is more useful if used by Miss Ning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting your words. Since I let you pick a stalk, just take it! Remember, when harvesting the herb pay, attention to area near the roots as toxin can fly out from it. It’s also where the poisonous creatures will appear from…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Number Two replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyes curved. “Good, then let us begin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saying so, her body flew towards the patch of Heavenly Ice Grass…</span></p>
