 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Sixth Prince’s mother was originally dissatisfied with the marriage, but she wasn’t a favored imperial concubine, and her family also had no influence or power. After considering the power the house of </span><span style>Marquis Jingyuan</span><span style> held that could support her son, she didn’t oppose the marriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But no one expected that at the age of eight, </span><span style>Ning Xuemo</span><span style> lost her father after he died in battle. Then, Madam Ning abandoned the young Ning Xuemo and died together with her husband. The influence of the house of Marquis Jingyuan withered from then on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marquis Jingyuan’s few distant relatives bullied the young Ning Xuemo. One after another, they came with clear and hidden motives, plundering all the family properties owned by Marquis Jingyuan. It took no more than a few years for the house of Marquis Jingyuan to become an empty shell compared to its former grandeur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the saying goes, when the tree topples the monkeys scatter; the servants and maids also ran away one after another or sought a way out. By the time Ning Xuemo turned twelve, in that big mansion, only one loyal servant remained. The two of them, master and servant, relied upon one another for survival. During times of hunger, they didn’t eat until they were full. They experienced winds, storms, the cold, and suffered all kinds of hardships...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, she was the Sixth Prince’s fiancée and these matters brought forth all kinds of resentment from the other party. Naturally, they wanted to withdraw from the marriage, but they were hindered by the Emperor’s edict. So, they didn’t dare to brazenly bring up the issue and could only scheme every kind of plot to give her all kinds of difficulties in the hopes that she would be compelled to bring up the subject of marriage annulment herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they didn’t expect that Ning Xuemo already had deep feelings for the Sixth Prince and had considered him as the only light in her life. No matter the sufferings and the humiliation, she wouldn’t open her mouth or mention the matters of marriage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This continued to the point that last year, the Sixth Prince eventually came to find a fault with her. He made it very clear that even if he were to take her as a wife by obligation, he would also take in an imperial concubine. She also clenched her teeth and agreed to this. She wholeheartedly wanted to be by his side...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t expect that not only did she fail to move the Sixth Prince’s heart, on the contrary, it made him more and more disgusted and fueled his desire to thoroughly get rid of her. She could only experience despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lived in a humble and careful way. Everything she did was cautious and prudent, but a tsunami of misfortunes always found her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last night, she was alone in the mansion when someone knocked her out. When she awoke, she discovered there was a lot of people forcing their way into her house. What’s more, her clothes were not in order and an unfamiliar man was lying on her bed...</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was truly catching them red handed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The future prince’s consort was caught in such a scandal. Naturally, it caused a sensation in the whole city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This era was extremely harsh on women. Unrestrained women would often be put to death in all kinds of way: drowned in a pig’s bamboo basket, burned to death, hanged and so on...</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this event, not to mention being degrade to the rank of imperial concubine, perhaps, it would also be quite difficult for Ning Xuemo to survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, she cried out her grievances, but there were witnesses and solid evidence. Who would listen to her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without being able to explain, she was directly sent into this iron cage which hung in the public square and received people’s scorn the whole day under the scorching sun. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo originally had a delicate body disposition. This kind of repeating torment left her barely alive. After being subjected to all kinds of humiliation and resentment, in the end, she killed herself by hitting her head on the iron cage… </span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the memories of the former owner of this body. As for the Ning Xuemo from the modern times, she successfully awakened in this ownerless body’s consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s palm lightly stroked her cheeks. She knew the reason why she possessed the former owner’s memories was because of her strong grievances. That little girl died without being able to close her eyes!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Little girl, rest in peace! Since your body allowed me to possess it, then, let your hatred be mine. I shall give you your revenge! I will make the person who framed you pay the just price for your suffering!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In her eyes, there was a glint of cold light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Sixth Prince has arrived!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the crowd no one knew who shouted, but like the tide, everyone receded, separating the throng of people and making a road appear in the middle of the public square.</span></p>
