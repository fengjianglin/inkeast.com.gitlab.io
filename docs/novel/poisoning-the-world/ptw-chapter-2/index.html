 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">This was absolutely not her hand!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although her hands were also very small and exquisite, they didn’t have the same appearance. These were the hands of an eleven year old child! They were absolutely not on par with her 22-year-old beautiful, glossy, and lily-white hands!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was she still dreaming?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wrong! In a dream, it was impossible for injuries to hurt, and at this moment, her whole body was hurting like it would in reality.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Is it reality?’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘It certainly is a very strange situation.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Of all the people, she had to be the one who transmigrated?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It appeared that she transmigrated by taking possession of someone’s dead body...</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also extremely melodramatic! The most dramatic point was she unexpectedly transmigrated into the body of a child!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was after all a secret service agent. To come across such a weird situation, she was merely startled for an instant. The corner of her mouth twitched several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly felt the burning pain on her forehead. Moreover, she also felt somewhat dizzy, and before her eyes, there were black spots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were symptoms of having excessive blood loss!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned over to sit, then took her pulse by sensing her right radial artery with her left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malnutrition, blood loss, and a mild cerebral concussion...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Riip!</span></i><span style> She tore a strip of cloth out of her skirt and wrapped it around her forehead in a direct and efficient way. She tightly wrapped it around the wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone, who stood around watching, became dumbstruck looking at their target of scorn, a timid and trembling girl who appeared as if she didn’t knock her own head just before. At this moment, she acted as though nobody was present, as she calmly and collectedly wrapped her wound. They temporarily couldn’t managed to react to that sudden changed, thus the surroundings became quiet and calm once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl’s forehead and cheeks still had blood on them. The plain clothes on her were dirty rags. At the lowest point of people’s lives, it seemed like others people would consciously step more mud on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at this moment, she sat there with her wound already wrapped and began combing her hair… the movements were like moving clouds and flowing water, unhurried and leisurely. Unexpectedly, it possessed an extremely unusual grace. There was a certain elegance within that grandeur, similar to a scene of a girl grooming herself in front of a mirror during spring. In what way did it look like the execution ground for an unrestrained daughter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of these spectators are commoners from the lowest echelon of society. Generally, they had a mentality that hated the rich. To see a formerly aloof and remote person in some dire straits being smeared in mud, their hearts felt oddly satisfied as if they were higher than that person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ning Xuemo’s unperturbed grace was naturally exceptionally dazzling in their eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shameless! Still combing what hair?! Being unrestrained like this for who to see?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected from an unrestrained wench, even at this time, she doesn’t forget to seduce men…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd cursed once again. Ning Xuemo raised her eyes which slightly narrowed. Her bright eyes, like moving water, turned toward the people who were opening their mouths to cursw her and moved past them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes were extremely black and deep. Those people who were cursing and the first to clamor were swept by her gaze. Unexpectedly, they quivered with their minds shivering! It was like their mind was poured with iced water. Unconsciously, they shut their mouth right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Xue Mo took no other actions, except she returned to combing her long hair as unhurriedly as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she combed her hair, there was a large portion of the memories that didn’t belong to her, flashing through her mind. She clearly understood that those memories were from the previous owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coincidentally, the previous owner of this body was also called Ning Xuemo. She was Vast Sky Empire’s Marquis Jingyuan’s only loved daughter. Marquis Jingyuan was once the Grand Marshal in the army. He was a pioneer and made heroic contributions for the development of Vast Sky’s territories. In order to reward and to rope him in, the Emperor arranged for the six years old Ning Xuemo to be the sixth prince’s fiancée. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On this continent, people cultivated some kind of internal power similar to psychokinesis. Almost everyone possessed more or less psychokinesis. Even the most average commoners have low-level psychokinesis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a saying that said that no tiger will have a dog for a daughter. Marquis Jingyuan innate psychokinesis was astonishing. His wife was also a psychokinesis genius, but to one’s surprise, she gave birth to a daughter who was crippled with absolutely no trace of psychokinesis. Their daughter turned into Vast Sky Empire’s joke and became the disgrace of Marquis Jingyuan’s house. </span></p>
