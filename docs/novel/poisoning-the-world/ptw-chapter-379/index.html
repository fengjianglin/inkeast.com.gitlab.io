 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The other young maidens looked toward Ning Xuemo. They took joy from her misfortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what if you have a divine beast?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who cares if you have high achievements in your martial arts cultivation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>You still can’t get the favor of men?</span></p>
 <p><span style>To sit over there all alone made her look like a huge joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mood of the banquet was somewhat delicate at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Le Xuan Emperor wanted to dissolve this embarrassing situation, an eunuch rushed from outside to report, “Reporting to Your Majesty, the Wise King’s heir is visiting!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” Le Xuan Emperor suddenly stood up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chancellor who sat nearby also stood up at the same time, looking at the eunuch in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch hurriedly repeated himself, saying once more, &nbsp;“The Wise King’s heir is waiting right outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor had no choice but to respond, “Invite him quickly!” He turned to face Ji Yunhuang, “Huang’er, lead some representatives to greet our guest in my stead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang led some men out. Ning Xuemo rummaged through her mind to find any information on this Wise King. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the continent, the emperor wasn’t the most respected figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from the five emperors, a few sects and families were not bound by imperial authority but instead, abided by a separate ruling system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For instance, the Sun Moon Sect, the Storm Sect, and the Everlasting School.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from the aforementioned famous sects and schools, there were also a few hidden clans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the most part, they existed within their own territories, obeying their own laws and decrees. These clans used their bloodline to continue the legacy of their schools, and all disciples were skilled with psychokinesis with experts as common as the clouds. They were self reliant and didn’t need the aid of the Imperial houses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only difference was that sects had disciples with many different surnames, while clans were comprised of family members and did not accept outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their power within the continent was not to be underestimated. The clan hierarchy was extremely strict.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even among the many clans, the Wise King Clan was particularly powerful. The Wise King Clan’s leader called himself the Wise King, and only the son of the Wise King could take over his position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the Wise King Clan were extremely low key and didn’t bother with the secular world. Thus, there was very little knowledge of their clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even most of the Imperial families didn’t met with them face to face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Wise King Clan’s power was not to be trifled with. If they were offended, even for the Imperial families, it would be difficult for them to escape from death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Wise King was originally called the King of Hell, but because of how nefarious it sounded, it was later changed to Wise King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that the Wise King’s son had come to pay a visit, Le Xuan Emperor did not dare to slight him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, all the young boys and girls present had an expression of curiosity and excitement. Everybody stretched their neck and peek towards the door. They all wanted to see what the heir of the mysterious Wise King looked like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a moment, the Wise King’s son followed Ji Yunhuang into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang’s expression was somewhat subtle; he came in first and gave Ning Xuemo a glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xuemo got a clear glimpse of the Wise King’s son, she dropped her wine cup and blurted, “Xijue!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue who she hasn’t seen for the whole day came in at this moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what he worn was ink black king’s clothes with a majestic dragon embroidered on it. His imposing manner had underwent a complete change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he was dressed in a marquis bodyguard uniform and looked like a razor sharp blade, his brilliant splendor hidden within. Furthermore, he looked a little childish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now that his body was outfitted with luxurious garments fitting only &nbsp;monarchs, his entire being was like a stone polished into diamond, radiating resplendent glory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Respectable, honorable, indifferent, and aloof, he resembled a king ruling over his lands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind him were four attendants, each and every one of them looked sharp and valiant. It was clear that each was a one-in-ten thousand genius.</span></p>
