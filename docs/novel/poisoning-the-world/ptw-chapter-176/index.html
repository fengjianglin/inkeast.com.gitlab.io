 <p></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the fact that she had strong willpower and immense patience, she would have leapt up the moment the wolf circled around her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she had prepared herself to leap up and do battle with it had the wolf bitten her on a fatal area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the boy didn’t seem to be after her life so the wolf didn’t bite her anywhere that would cause a fatal wound. She had secretly gritted her teeth as she tried to endure the pain, and endure it she did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only when the child personally came to her side that she chose to make use of the best moment to strike, so that she could succeed in a single move!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like the ginseng child was only a bit stronger in terms of techniques and arts; his escaping speed was a bit quick, but his body didn’t have much strength to speak of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo had suffered so much at the child’s hands, so naturally she wouldn’t be courteous when she made her move. The moment she tackled him, she immediately pierced him with countless needles coated in anesthesia. She wanted to knock him out first before doing anything else!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had originally wanted to simply end him, after all, ginseng spirits were great tonics...</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she killed him, then maybe he wouldn’t be in the form of a child but a ginseng. That way, when she ate it she wouldn’t feel too barbaric.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the child’s last words caused her to hesitate. Looking at his exquisite features, she felt rather unable to continue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She actually wasn’t stopped by his threat. Based on Ning Xuemo’s temper, she hadn’t been scared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, her gaze landed on the back of the child’s head. It was currently leaking out fresh scarlet blood...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She subconsciously dabbed a bit of it on her finger before lifting it to her nose to take a sniff.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Your mom, how could it be so much like real blood?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style> It was surprising that ginseng spirits could bleed too. Furthermore, this blood smelled exactly the same as human blood...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, she looked at the flower-like cinnabar mole at the center of his forehead as doubt surfaced in her mind. Was this little fellow really a ginseng spirit? Maybe that cinnabar mole just so happened to grow into the shape of a ginseng flower?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘But even if he wasn’t a ginseng spirit, he shouldn’t be human right?’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Whose family’s child could manage to wind up here?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>And this child even knew a great technique for </span><span style>s</span><span style>cattering beans to make soldiers<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only had to fold things into the shape of animals to make them into real animals, which was rather similar to Taoist arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little fellow’s technique was so great that it was obvious he was someone amongst experts. She had heard that when one cultivated to a certain level, they could cultivate a nascent soul<a href="#1"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span><span style> and that nascent soul could leave the body. ‘</span><i><span style>Could it be that this little child was the nascent soul of some powerful immortal?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo got completely stunned by her own conjecture. In this world she had read quite a few books on cultivation, yet she had never discovered anything pertaining to nascent soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nascent soul was a concept only mentioned in her previous world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the records there mentioned that while Taoist masters could cultivate a nascent soul that took the form of a one or two-year-old child, its features would still be similar to the original person’s, just a few times shrunken down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And this child looked exactly like one. Bright and intelligent, tender and full of life, simply making people want to hug and kiss him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, anyone who wanted to chop him up into mincemeat really required a certain level of courage...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She once again lowered her eyes to look at him. ‘</span><i><span style>Tsk! Tsk! He unexpectedly changed his clothes in such a short time.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was no longer wearing that apron but a small white chinese-style long gown which looked exquisite, highlighting his beautiful small face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For no reason, this little child reminded her of Huba from Monster Hunt<a href="#1"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Huba didn’t look like a human, but it was so cute that it made people feel happy and made people take pity on it, not bearing to harm it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention its cuteness, this little child before her eyes looked human: similar to a charming pretty doll, even though she fully knew he was a monster...</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the little child woke up, he found himself tied up like a dumpling to a large stone.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">[2] The raws used <span style>?? (yuanying)&nbsp;which</span>&nbsp;l<span style>iterally means first or primordial infant, but we’re reusing Deathblade’s term from I Shall Seal the Heaven, Nascent Soul, since it’s the same character and meaning. <a href="http://wiki.wuxiaworld.com/index.php?title=ISSTH:Cultivation#Nascent_Soul_.28yuanying.29" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more info.</span></p>
