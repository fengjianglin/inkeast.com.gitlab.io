 <p></p>
 <p><span style>If she were to get married to the Crown Prince, then maybe not only would she be restraining Ji Yunhuang’s life, but she would also influence the Vast Sky Empire… </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ningxue, what… what is your condition? I will try to satisfy it to the best of my abilities.” This sentence was much more sly and politically ingenious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was exceptionally smart; how could she not know the feelings of this father and daughter pair? </span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of her mouth curved slightly in a way that was somewhere in between mocking and ridiculing. “Your Majesty, do not worry. I have no desire to be the Crown Prince’s consort. Xuemo’s request can easily be fulfilled by Your Majesty.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor finally sighed in relief, “Good, speak.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemos eyes landed on Ji Yunyao. Ji Yunyao felt an indescribable feeling of coldness, vaguely feeling like she was being stared at by some ferocious beast. She couldn’t help but retreat a step. “You… why are you looking at me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s lip curled even more. Looking at her smiling face, Ji Yunyao felt even more fear and trepidation. Inside her heart, a feeling of uneasiness bubbled up as if she was about to encounter some serious misfortune! </span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, her intuition was correct. Sure enough, Ning Xuemo opened her mouth. “Your Majesty, princess has repeatedly attacked Xuemo with no reason. And because of this, Xuemo has nearly died in her hands many times. Now, whenever Xuemo sees her, Xuemo feels very upset…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor immediately said, “I will immediately make her leave…” He turned towards and looked at her meaningfully. “Get lost now!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunyao also knew that getting into a dispute at this time wasn’t right, so even though her heart felt unsatisfied, she still decided to leave. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ning Xuemo actually laughed jeeringly. “This is how Your Majesty grants Xuemo’s requests? That is fine…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>She said the last three words very slowly and heavily. Le Xuan Emperor’s heart jumped, and he could only say, “Then what is your condition?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess’s words are very insulting, making people feel uncomfortable and angry. Xuemo thinks that Your Majesty should discipline her a little.” Ning Xuemo took the initiative to say the first part of her request. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor clenched his teeth saying, “You are right. This child is indeed lacking in discipline… Someone come! Take Princess away, and slap her mouth thirty times!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Imperial Princess getting slapped was definitely an enormous humiliation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even more, the hand of the person who did the slapping felt like it was made of iron. One slap could make half of the face red; two slaps could remove a tooth… &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunyao usually really liked this punishment of slapping people; however, she only liked to slap other people. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Any girls that offended her or any maidservants who made an error were usually sentenced to this punishment. Looking on as their faces were slapped until they resembled pigs, she would feel incredibly happy on the inside… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Throughout her whole life the people who she sentenced to this punishment couldn’t be counted. In addition, after the person was slapped, they were paraded through the streets. It was extremely embarrassing and disgraceful. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A lot of the girls who were sentenced to this punishment by her were extremely disgraced and humiliated. Many even committed suicide… </span></p>
 <p><span style>And now, it was her turn to suffer this punishment! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she thought of the swollen and purple-green faces of those people who she had sentenced to that punishment, Ji Yunyao was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, immediately jumping over. “Imperial Father, don’t listen to that slut’s nonsense…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sixty!” Ning Xuemo coldly spat out one word. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slut, what are you saying?!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ninety!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor was practically being defeated by his stupid daughter! </span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately opened his mouth, “Someone come and drag the princess down! Slap her ninety times!” One snap stopped Ji Yunyao’s mouth from spewing more stupid words. Otherwise, the number of slaps she would have to suffer would steadily rise… &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>……..........................</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two court eunuchs received the meaningful glance the Emperor sent their way and came over to drag Ji Yunyao away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Ning Xuemo still wasn’t done. “Your Majesty, the Princess is the most precious young girl under the heavens, and thus she should be elegant, righteous, and virtuous. However, Princess Ji Yunyao clearly doesn’t fit these conditions. To prevent her from being a laughingstock in the eyes of the public, she should be removed of her title of princess, and it should never be reinstated no matter what!” </span></p>
