 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As if to confirm her words, the monster was still alive even after being hit by a rocket. While it was letting out a long hiss, the wound on its neck was healing at mach speed. In a short period of time, it was back to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo, “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run! I’m out of ammo!” That young version of Stallone ordered her to run quickly as he pulled her hand and ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo also discovered that her bazooka only had an artillery shell left. </span><i><span style>‘No choice then. Have to run.’</span></i><span style> Right now, she only hoped that it was an aquatic monster and wouldn’t go ashore...</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was difficult to say when it came to the things in this world, because amphibious monster were far from rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And indeed, she only ran for 10 meters when, she heard footsteps that sounded more like explosions right behind her. The earth shook and trembled at every step it took.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo quickly turned to take a look. She simply wanted to cry. </span><i><span style>‘Your mother! This thing is not a sea monster. It’s Godzilla!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In what kind of mystical country did she transmigrate to?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep inside her heart, she felt there was something fishy about this whole situation. However, in this time of crisis, she had no time to think about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, this time she was not escaping alone. She had a comrade! A younger version of Stallone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hand was warm and dry while his palm was full of hard calluses, a distinctive trait of a genuine iron-blooded tough guy. Ning Xuemo dashed following him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After fighting for such a long time, she was like an arrow at the end of its course. Her footsteps were growing heavier and heavier. In the end, she was unable to keep up with Young Stallone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the monster was quickly pressing closer. It was obvious that it had no intention of letting them go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the boundless earth and the unlimited sky, their running speed was nowhere near the monster’s speed behind them. It was only a matter of time before they became monster snacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo suddenly had a thought. In fact, if she could die together with her idol, it shouldn’t be considered unfair, right? At least, it was much better than dying a lonely death...</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the thought passed through her mind, she felt that her steps were heavier, and at the same time, Young Stallone’s speed became slower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shadow of death loomed above their heads. Suddenly, Ning Xuemo accelerated and threw herself into Young Stallone’s arms; then she hugged his neck and kissed his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to take advantage of the fact that she was at death’s door to realize one of her dreams! One of her dreams was to kiss a young Sylvester Stallone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heroic man of steel’s body faintly stiffened, but he didn’t evade her kiss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon her little mouth was pressed against her idol’s lips. The dusky background seemed to be abruptly ripped apart, and a silhouette floated down. That person had yet to touch the ground when his hand chopped down, emitting a white light. Ning Xuemo’s body felt numb, and she fell out of her idol’s bosom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, she staggered from being pulled by a hand. It felt like she was fluttering in the air like a flag. Without any freedom, she was pulled and forced by that figure to make a 21-24 meter jump!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the monster finally caught up to where she was. Its tail swept at the place where her idol stood and sent him into the air!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was shocked, “STALLONE!” She just wanted to jump back and save him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idiot, this is a world of illusions! Wake up!” The voice next to her ear was one that she hadn’t heard for a while. It was Jiu Zun’s voice. At the same time she heard his voice, some kind of energy went through her palm, flowing along her blood vessels and rushing directly into her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud rumble resounded inside her brain as her whole body quivered and trembled from the cold.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘A world of illusions?! So nothing was real?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly lifted her head and saw Stallone’s body instantly melt like ice under the sun.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">[expand title="<strong>Teaser</strong>"]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>She once again turned to look at that inky black Godzilla, who was actually still standing there and even glaring hatefully at her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that Ning Xuemo was looking at it, it raised its head and loudly roared before pouncing towards her!</span></p>
