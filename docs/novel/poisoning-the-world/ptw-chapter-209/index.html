 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">Then would there be a hero appearing out of nowhere to catch her in his arms?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Bang!</span></i><span style>” She fell directly into a place that was firm yet soft at the same time. She hurriedly opened her eyes and became dumbfounded!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘That cannot be!’</span></i><span style> Unexpectedly, a hero really came to her rescue?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, she fell into that person’s embrace. However, there was something strange about that person. To her surprise, the man had Sylvester Stallone's face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ning Xuemo stared at the man with big eyes, that clone of Stallone was floating to the shore while carrying her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Not bad!’ </span></i><span style>When they reached the shore, she finally was able to set foot on the ground. Then, everything that happened next made Ning Xuemo felt as if she was in a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style>After the robust hero released her on the ground, from who knows where, he took out a submachine gun. Then, he rushed towards the monster and opened fire! </span><i><span style>Rat-tata-tata-ta-ta! </span></i><span style>The sound of bullets constantly echoed as the bullets rained down upon the monster.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Ning Xuemo held her forehead as she stood there. She felt her three views were in chaos!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘God!’ </span></i><span style>Could it be that her idol Sylvester Stallone had also transmigrated?!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Inconceivable!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly even his firearm transmigrated with him. He was also a foreigner like her little friend, Tom, but unlike Tom, he was much more blessed and had some gear!</span></p>
 <p><i style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Her stomach was still terribly painful ever since she was whipped by the monster’s tail. Her blood and energy were violently rolling inside of her, and there was a fishy and metallic aftertaste in her throat. She forced herself from spitting out blood.</i></p>
 <p><i style="font-size: 1.5rem;">‘Such an excruciating pain!’</i><span style> Could it be that her ribs were broken?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style>She reached out to her thorax and as expected felt that some parts of her chest had sunk. She had three broken ribs.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The monsters on this mountain all had scales that can’t be pierce by bullets. This monster was so big, it scales shouldn’t be so easy pierce, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hero Stallone’s marksmanship was like a Little Plum Flying Dagger<a href="&quot;#1'"><sup>[1]</sup></a> never missing its mark. However, even if the bullets hit, if they didn’t pierce the scales, it was still useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo raised her head in concern. As expected, Stallone’s machine gun sprayed a long tongue of flame as he shot at the inky black monster. Countless sparks could be seen as if the bullets were shooting at steel. </span><i style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Clang-clang-clang-clang! </i><span style>The sound echoed as the bullet ricocheted everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘It is completely ineffective!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The monster was clearly enraged. It ferociously swam to the shore despite the rain of bullets and held his head high like a tower on a small island. Its mouth was filled with dense rows of teeth glinting dangerously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s heartbeat accelerated. She looked around in search for a weapon, but there was nothing else besides rocks and stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, it would have been good if she had an anti-tank gun! She would certainly be able to pierce through that thick scales!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She retreated a step, then felt like she stepped on something. She lowered her head and her heart almost wanted to jump out!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘The heavens have eyes!’ </span></i><span style>She has stepped on a rocket launcher!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">She was simply in exultation. As a secret service agent, she played and mastered all kinds of firearms. Her marksmanship was first class. However, ever since she came to this world, she didn’t have the possibility to use these things!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she saw the weapon, it was as if she was back on Earth and met with her most closest relative. She grabbed the rocket launcher and put it on her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this baby, what was there to be afraid of?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately aimed at the black monster and swiftly pulled the trigger. The shell let out a trail of flame as it launched!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like it was before, her marksmanship was extremely accurate. The rocket shell hit exactly on the monster’s neck. The monster bellowed as a big hole appeared on its neck and blood rained down like a waterfall.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Mission accomplished!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Ning Xuemo’s mouth lightly pursed. ‘</span><i><span style>Once again, OP Monster vs modern firearms, OP Monster lose!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This world’s monsters were simply too abnormal, especially those from the 9th Mountain. They are comparable to an abnormal fighter aircraft. What's more, they were all at least rank 7 or 8. Perhaps, they could be undying aliens with extremely high self-healing ability...</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">[expand title="<strong>Teaser</strong>"]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As if to confirm her words, the monster was still alive even after being hit by the rocket. While it was letting out long hiss, the wound on its neck was healing at mach speed. In a short period of time, it was back to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo, “...”</span></p>
