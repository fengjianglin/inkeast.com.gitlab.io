 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style>Ning Xuemo’s </span><i><span style>shenfa </span></i><span style>was as fast as lightning. The sword light danced all around Ji Yunyao. It took a short moment for her clothes to be cut. Her skirt became extremely short and her face was completely covered in multiples sword cuts. Furthermore, it was bright red and heated up. She also didn’t realize yet that her face was marred with cuts...</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunyao started to curse continuously while backing away, till the point that she could not do it any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo once again used the sword. She sliced Ji Yunyao’s clothes into half from her rib region to the end of her sleeve, revealing the cut skin on her thorax as the clothes fell. Ji Yunyao finally crumbled. “I know, I know… I was wrong. You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you finally realized that you were wrong now? Too late!” Ning Xuemo flipped her wrist and a sword light flashed, descending towards Ji Yunyao’s left shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Ning Xuemo had no intention of taking Ji Yunyao’s life. After all, this woman was Ji Yunhuang’s half-sister. If she killed her here, she wouldn’t be able to explain to Ji Yunhuang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, Ji Yunhuang treated her pretty well. She would give him some face...</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she still needed to teach that Princess a lesson. She wanted to engrave that lesson into her memory, so that she wouldn’t do it again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” Suddenly, a shout could be heard from a distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after the voice was heard, a pale indigo light whistled fiercely towards Ning Xuemo’s chest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo heard that shout and her heart slightly palpitated. By the time the indigo light was in front of her, her complexion paled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had no time to care about the injured Ji Yunyao as she pulled back the sword and used it to defend herself from the attack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clang! </span></i><span style>The indigo light collided against her sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The force contained in the attack numbed her wrist and sent her sword flying up into the sky!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before, Ning Xuemo was standing as firm as a boulder, but her posture became unsteady after getting attacked. She lost her footing and staggered a few steps back before she could steady her posture once again. She could feel her ankle searing in pain as she had sprained it</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slowly, she raised her head and saw a man dressed in white clothes jumping off a golden-eyed bird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother!” Ji Yunyao shouted as she saw her savior and threw herself in the man’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-clothed man was handsome and tall. In a crowd of handsome men and beautiful women, he also didn’t lose in terms of appearance and had a calm bearing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Ji Yunhuang! Unexpectedly, he came!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother! This slut bullied me! </span><i><span style>Waaah-! </span></i><span style>I don’t want to live anymore…” Ji Yunyao tightly hugged his waist, crying out all the tears in her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her face was still red and swollen. As her front teeth had been broken, a whislting sound could be heard as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang almost didn’t believe that the one in his arms was his little sister. He had never saw his little sister cut such a sorry figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her whole body was full of bloodstains. Her clothes had been cut into tatters and her snow-white skin was being exposed in many places...</span></p>
 <p><span style>He subconsciously took off his outer robe and covered his sister’s body with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Ning Xuemo who was standing on the side, then look at Ji Yunyao in his arms. His brows knitted. “Exactly what is going on here?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that someone had finally come to Ji Yunyao’s rescue, her confidence rekindled once again. She immediately cried like raindrops on a pear blossom. “Big Brother, I was looking for her in your stead and came here with great difficulty… watching over at her… I’m also fond of her. So when I saw there was some misunderstanding between her and that group of people, I told them her identity… But then, she actually flew into a rage. Like a madman, she dishonored our reputation by saying we… said that we… I-I can’t say it! In my anger, I fought with her. I just want to teach her a lesson and let her understand on how to have a sense of propriety. I didn’t expected her to actually use a sneak attack and use such a heavy hand… Big Brother! I want you to judge for me…” She said such a long speech which seemed like the truth but was in actually filled with falsehoods since all the truth was completely distorted by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang’s sight landed on Ning Xuemo. His expression wasn’t good. “Xuemo, is it true?”</span></p>
