 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo raised her head in alarm just in time to see two little birds from afar that seemed to be Golden-eyed Falcons, descending to this place at a very fast speed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last night, she had suffered a lot under the claws of these falcons. If it wasn’t for that bastard bird, Number Two would not have died and she would not have been forced to suffer in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The memory of Number Two’s bloodied face flashed inside her mind as a cold light glinted inside her eyes. Her thin lips pursed. “Little kid, is it alright if we exterminate them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little child looked at her pensively, “Do you hate them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friend died under their claws. I want revenge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a world where the strong prey upon the weak. For people with inferior skills, even if they died, they cannot complain. One has to possess strength if one wants to take revenge. Blindly using force is a rash behavior.” The little child’s tone was like a teacher lecturing his disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo, “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was unexpectedly lectured by a little kid!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was she understood those principles. However, when she saw those damn birds, her heart felt aggrieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her former life, her martial arts were at the peak, combining the advantages of using both the official and underground methods. It gave her the strength to be able to repay debts of gratitude as well as avenge grievances as she liked. If someone caused her to suffer in any way, she would immediately beat them up and return all that suffering to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She fiercely protected her subordinates. Using her own strength, she protected and led them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could not just watch as her subordinates were bullied in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If her subordinates died in the enemy’s hands, she would use any means necessary to take the murderer’s life to avenge her subordinates. Not once has she let people who killed her subordinates off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And this time, Number Two died for her sake, yet she was unable to even save his body. She had to watch as he was taken away by the bird to become its food...</span></p>
 <p><span style>This type of bird wasn’t afraid of poison and was hard to harm with weapons. With her current strength, wanting to kill it was truly difficult...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pursed her lips. </span><span style>For a gentleman to take revenge, ten years is not too long<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span><span style>.</span><span style> Sooner or later she would come and exterminate these birds’ nest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment, she should first think of a way to get out of this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right. Let’s go!” Ning Xuemo pulled on the little child’s hand as she started to sprint away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those two Golden-eyed Falcons charged towards the corpse of the weird dragon. For the moment, they had not discovered the two people hiding behind a large boulder. This was the opportunity for them to quietly leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to take revenge right now, it’s not impossible! I can teach you a move!” The little child spoke once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyes lit up slightly. “Okay! What move?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know if she could finish learning it in such a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The weak spot of Golden-eyed Falcons is located at the center of the underside of their left wing. They can use Freezing Spell, which belong to the water element, one of the </span><span style>five elements<a href="#1"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span><span style>. Thus using an earth-type weapon would be effective against them.” The child mentioned in a casual tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A green vein popped up on Ning Xuemo’s forehead. Although she now knew where their weak spot was, it was on the underside of their left wing, but it’s too difficult to attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, all the weapons she had brought had metal properties, where would she get an earth attributed weapon?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She scanned her surroundings which were littered with broken pieces of mountain rocks...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She picked up a piece of stone, then looked at the child. “What do I do next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He should be teaching her a technique right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child spoke frankly. “The next step depends on you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Dammit!’</span></i><span style> Black lines appeared on Ning Xuemo’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the child saw her expression, he leisurely spoke. “Your current strength is too weak. You can choose to give up and come back when you’re stronger. Besides, with your current strength, nobody would laugh at you for retreating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lowered her eyes slightly before smiling. “There is no such thing as ‘retreating’ in my dictionary!” She patted the child’s shoulder. “Hide yourself well; in a while I won’t be able to take care of you.”</span></p>
