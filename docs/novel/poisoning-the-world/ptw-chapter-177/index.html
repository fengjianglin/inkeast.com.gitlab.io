 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Note : Ning Xuemo is such a rogue. XD</em></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The moment the little child woke up, he found himself tied up like a dumpling to a large stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo tied people up quite professionally; it was a standard Five Flowers tie<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Not only were all of his limbs restrained, even his fingers had been restrained. Now, he couldn’t even move a finger much less make a hand seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo sat not far beside him. A fire roared in front of her, and the light from the fiercely burning campfire flickered on her small face. As if noticing he had woken up, she turned her head and smiled. Under the moonlight, four of her white teeth could be seen shining. “Little guy, how do you want to die? Do you want to be roasted or stewed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little child didn’t struggle. He was silent for a moment before speaking, “If you’re roasting, the nutriment would be lost. If you want to stew it is more nutritious, but you don’t have a pot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo “...” His words were true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this little child was a bit too calm. Was he that sure she wouldn’t kill him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was rather unhappy. She walked over while playing with the blade in her hand. “The nutrition from roasting is a bit inferior, but it’s much better than not eating at all. I’ll simply truss you up and roast you. I once roasted suckling pig before; the smell was very appetizing. The taste of roast ginseng spirit shouldn’t be too inferior to that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little child pursed his lips and didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo squatted down in front of him and used the blade’s handle to tap his body. With a smile and a benign countenance, she spoke, “How is it? Do you have a better idea? If you don’t, then I guess I’ll be happy to decide for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That child stared at her with his pair of deep blue eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her large eyes shone with light as she stared at him smilingly with dimples appearing on her cheeks. She seemed honest and sincere with traces of youthful innocence. However, her true self was a crafty little fiend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This small child’s eyes were too profound, like the unpredictable deep sea. The short moment when Ning Xuemo’s gaze met with his, her heart skipped a beat. With a cough, she hurriedly shifted her gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She slid her blade along his little face. “How about I first cut off theses two lumps of meat on your pretty face and try to roast them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child’s expression was like a deflated balloon when Ning Xuemo’s blade came very close to his face. Subconsciously, he tried to dodge it but failed. Instead, her knife accidentally sliced his cheek, drawing a few beads of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was slightly stunned before she hurriedly moved the knife away...</span></p>
 <p><span style>If such a pretty face was disfigured it would truly be too horrible to look at! ‘</span><i><span style>I have sinned!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little child didn’t seem bothered by the wound on his face. A hint of laughter flashed past his eyes. It was incredibly faint, so faint that even Ning Xuemo who stared straight at him failed to notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young lady…” He opened his mouth and spoke frankly. “If you let me go I can escort you out of the 9th mountain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who would believe you!” Ning Xuemo sat down. “Last time you said you wouldn’t run, but the moment I take my eyes off you I couldn’t even find your shadow, and you even ended up scheming against me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last time was because you were too bold and took too many liberties…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo also finally thought of that time where she patted his apron and unintentionally patted his private parts...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She coughed and then made a smile that showed she didn’t give damn about it, glancing at his lower body with a no good expression. “You little pipsqueak, do you have the right equipment to talk about taking liberties? That thing of yours… isn’t it just the size of a bean sprout?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little child, “...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This girl is too shameless!!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He lived for so many years, but this was the first time he had seen a little girl with such a thick face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he had met this little girl, it seemed he experienced many things for the first time.</span></p>
