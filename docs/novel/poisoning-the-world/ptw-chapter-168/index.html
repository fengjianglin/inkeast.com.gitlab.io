 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lowered her head and saw the sight of the two fingers intertwining. </span><i><span style>‘How embarrassing! </span></i><span style>?’ </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This… this looks somewhat like Yuelao’s red thread binding the fate of two people together…’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ptui!</span></i><span style> What was she even thinking?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was only an ingredient that she had grabbed. She would eat him later, so what fate could there be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he was a human, this little bean sprout that was not even taller than a garlic shoot could not possibly be her destined one!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I’m overthinking!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>To make sure he did not escape, she reeled in the rest of the red thread fluttering in the wind and wound it around the little ginseng’s chest many times!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the ginseng child’s magic power was high, it still possessed the body of a child and did not have much physical strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, when he was restrained by Ning Xuemo earlier, he was unable to struggle out from her arms. The only thing he could do was stare at Ning Xuemo with his ocean blue eyes while slightly pursing his little mouth and wearing a calm expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment ago, his long hair was floating on the water, but a few strands wound up on Ning Xuemo’s wrist and shoulder, causing her to itch as they rustled. When Ning Xuemo wrapped the red thread around his body, she also took the opportunity to untangle herself from his hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little child’s technique was outstanding. He was a ginseng, so his hair must be what was once his tassel. Perhaps he could used it to coil around someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With great difficulty, she was able to restrain him. She did not want some mishaps to happen like being suffocated by his long hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, if it’s a 10,000 years old ginseng, its tassels would also be very nourishing. She will not throw any part of it away, not even a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo carried him while advancing underwater for a moment. Soon afterwards, she started sinking. She used more force to kick the water in order to reach the surface. There was no way she would be able to process him underwater. To consume this little ginseng, she needed to go ashore to be able enjoy her meal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Huh? How come this child is suddenly so heavy?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She felt like she was carrying a big stone instead of a small ginseng child!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weight made her unable to swim to the surface. Instead of going up, she kept sinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lowered her head and looked at the child in her arms. He was looking at her with a wooden face, but his captivating red little mouth was slightly raised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he taunting her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, Ning Xuemo just wanted to put her short blade on his neck and threaten him. However, both of her hands were currently occupied and that idea died before it could be applied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she was hit with inspiration. She brought her red lips near his ear. “Little friend, if you’re playing a trick again, I will just bite off your ear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was really inconvenient to talk underwater, so she decided to stick close to his ear in order for him to hear her words, though her voice sounded somewhat strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she was done speaking, she used her mouth to suck on his ear lobe and, to make her point clear, her little teeth sank into his ear lobe...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ginseng child’s body became stiff in an instant and his body weight became lighter. Now, it resumed to the weight of a normal child.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘He can be obedient!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was pleased and let go of his ear. She swam to the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, they reached the surface. Ning Xuemo breathed in a mouthful of air. Although only 15 minutes had passed, many things happened during that time which left her extremely tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silvery moonlight shone down, illuminating the delicate child in her arms. Being so close, she could see that his facial features were extremely beautiful, perfectly refined like a crystal doll.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo could not remove her sight from it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you thinking?” Eventually, the little child spoke. His voice was melodious, like a crystal bell ringing under the wind, with a trace of a cold feeling similar to giant glacier mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you guess?” Ning Xuemo gave an enigmatic reply before she smiled widely at him, showing four little bright teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His blue ocean eyes gleamed as he said, “I can’t guess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Hn…</span></i><span style> Then, you don’t need to guess. In a moment, you will know. If you behave, I won’t mistreat you.” Ning Xuemo appeased him with a smile while she swam to the shore.</span></p>
