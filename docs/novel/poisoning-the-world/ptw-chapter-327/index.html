 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style>Ning Xuemo shook her head. “I don’t know him.” She only saved the teenager because his face resembled Number Two’s; that’s all.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“This person, really! You saved his life and gave him that grass, but he didn’t even say a word of thanks. He was very rude!” The little qilin felt somewhat indignant fro his master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An act of kindness does not necessarily need a recompense. I also don’t need his words of thanks. Personally, he’s much better than that red-clothed degenerate.” That perverted Xue Yilan was truly someone who bit the hand that fed him! Fortunately, he was duped by Ning Xuemo and thrown into that lake filled with monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what its master said, that degenerate was eaten by the monsters within the lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It has been many days since he appeared before them. Could it be that he really died?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was such a pity for the Blackwave Zither. Who knew where that man could have hidden it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo shook her head. She decided not to trouble herself with that question. She yawned and said, “Let’s go quickly. I’m sleepy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>The story about Ning Xuemo being able to tame a qilin was well-known in the capital. Therefore, recently the qilin often appeared in his original appearance. Besides drawn in a crowd, nothing else happened, and no one tried to capture it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they captured the qilin, they would have to grab Ning Xuemo, the bearer of bad luck, with them since the bearer of misfortunes was the one who tamed the qilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time Ning Xuemo was somewhat tired, so she just let the little qilin carry her back to the city at a fast pace. Nothing happen along the way, apart from attracting sidelong glances from the passerby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, bits of conversation would float into her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that person who just passed by the Ning Mansion’s Young Miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that’s her, the bearer of misfortunes…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Gasp! </span></i><span style>Stay far away from her. Don’t get contaminated by her bad luck….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Hmph! </span></i><span style>After you go back home, clean yourself properly to wash off the bad luck…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people were in a heated conversation when they suddenly heard two whistling sounds in front of them. They both lifted their head and saw two jet black balls flying directly into their mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stench from the balls assailed their nostrils!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They almost choked to death by that thing. In a flurry, they used their hands to pull out the ball and looked at it before they started to vomit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The things that almost caused them to suffocate were two balls of fresh donkey dung.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that moment, they heard a cute laugh, like the sound of silver bells ringing in front of them and getting further away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>...................……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, good accuracy!” The little qilin praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its little master didn’t even turn her head and only used that branch in her hand to swing the dung off the ground, and then the dung flew directly into the mouths of those people behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo covered her mouth as she yawned, “Of course. Your master is considered the number one hidden weap…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was speaking, they already reached the city entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo rushed forward when suddenly the soldiers surrounded her with bustling noises, “Back! She returned!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo frowned. She didn’t do anything violating the law recently. So why would the soldiers surround her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to inquire when the crowd parted on both sides, and a man in black imperial guard clothing came out and kneeled in front of her. “Miss Ning, please save our crown prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was speechless, “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She already recognized the person in front of her. He was Ji Yunhuang’s personal bodyguard. She already saw him 2-3 times. His name was Lei Liu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to your crown prince?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Highness, he… he received heavy injury and he’s at death’s door…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyebrows raised. She immediately said, “Go. Let’s go to the crown prince’s mansion! Lei Liu, tell me all the specifics on how he got injured…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>.........................……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once disciplined and orderly, the crown prince’s mansion had now turned into chaos in a short span of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crown prince’s aides and advisors, the civil and military ministers, and even the Le Xuan Emperor were all gathered in the crown prince’s mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The imperial physicians and all the famous doctors within the capital were immediately summoned to the crown prince’s mansion.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left">Man... people these days should get into their head that life skills are meant to help them survive&nbsp;in zombie apocalypse or when the supermarket is nowhere to be found. There's no need to master each life skills, but you still need to master at least level 1 or 2.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">I'm talking about it because I'm flabbergasted when some people I know can't make an omelet or stir fried frozen vegetables without burning it. Level 1 cooking required observation skill only. There's no grand cooking techniques at level 1. You&nbsp;can't said that you can't cook when you don't pay attention to quantity of ingredients and cooking time, or notice when your food turned charcoal. This is more of an attention problem than being a cooking inept. I personally think that cooking is like a shorter version of refining pills in cultivation. The process could be long, but the final product is eatable and good for you.... except if you failed or refined a poison pill.</p>
