 <p><span style>Her suture points technique was extremely brilliant as she had accumulated innumerable practical experience. The gaze he gave her was complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kind of medical technique was unseen in this age, not to mention that he could see how experienced she was from her mastery of her techniques. It was evident that it wasn’t the first time she cured someone through the meant of surgery. It couldn’t be that she was born with those skills?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ning Xuemo took out a blue sparkling thing and fed Ji Yunhuang with it, the surgery was truly complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took a whole 10 hours. The operation lasted 10 hours; despite that, Ning Xuemo’s body was still pretty good and she didn’t feel mentally exhausted at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stretched her limbs, then went to wash her hands. She turned her head to look at Ji Yunhuang. The qilin scale truly deserved to be called a divine item. The incision on his chest was already showing sign of healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She believed it wouldn’t take long before no trace of his injury could be seen, and it would unlikely leave any scars that would mar his beautiful strong chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was still pale, his breathing was more stable and less laborious compared to before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo took Ji Yunhuang’s pulse. After carefully examining him, he once again looked at Ning Xuemo with an inconceivable look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang’s heart vessels were connected again! Without any defect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart wildly pounded in his chest as if it was broken, but it wasn’t or it seemed to be on the verge of stopping, but it doesn’t!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the poisonous insects, it could no longer be sensed. It was evident that Ning Xuemo got rid of those insects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo yawned. She’s tired since it’s been awhile since she last operated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked out of the window. Outside, dawn had just arrived. She didn’t expect it was already morning of the following day!</span></p>
 <p><span style>....................……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo left shortly after. The young eunuch that was guarding outside hurried to report to the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor rushed like the wind, followed by his officials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!” The little qilin ran especially fast and practically threw himself onto Ning Xuemo’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before its master went into the room, she forbid it from disturbing her; thus, it didn’t dare to use their telepathic connection to inquire about the situation inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuemo, h-how is Huang’er?” Le Xuan Emperor asked with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortunately, I didn’t fail.” Ning Xuemo bluntly replied before patting the little qilin’s head. “You’ve been good. Turn back into your original form, and let’s go home.” So she can rest properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her short reply completely dissipated all the worries he had. Since he couldn’t speak harmoniously with Ning Xuemo, he raised his leg and was about to go into the operation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, right now, no one is allowed to see him. If you all go in, you will bring along harmful bacteria. You will be able to visit him tomorrow at the same hour. I already informed Divine Doctor Mo with all the medical recommendations. I’m tired, so I’ll return first.” Ning Xuemo was already mounted on the back of the little qilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo simply stretched out half of his body from the operation room and lightly nodded to Le Xuan Emperor, confirming that Ning Xuemo’s words were true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the Emperor was reassured and immediately sent an order, “Servants, prepare an eight carriers palanquin and send Miss Ning back! I’ll reward her handsomely later…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>....................……</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Ning Xuemo was sent back into an eight carriers palanquin. The whole trip back was done with a continuously beating gong and it was a particularly grandiose scene, attracting numerous habitants early in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor was very generous and rewarded her with several chests of valuables trailing behind the palanquin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Ning Xuemo transmigrated, she regularly met with bad luck. If it wasn’t getting into life or death situation, it was getting forced into a marriage or having a continuous strings of events that caused people to disdain her. Now, she could get a respite!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt that her luck was finally turning for the better. Hard times are now over, and the good times are just starting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She still kept her ears sharp and her eyes keen, paying attention to the numerous people chatting around her. Despite the conversations being abundant and chaotic, she could nevertheless hear a few things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst those conversations, she didn’t hear any new information. It was mostly about people expressing their envy, incomprehension, and surprise.</span></p>
