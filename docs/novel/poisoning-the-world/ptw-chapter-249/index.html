 <p></p>
 <p>Her past was similar to the little qilin, but compared to it, she was more fortunate. At least, she once experienced the unconditional love of a parent and still remembered their appearance. Whereas the little qilin was much more miserable, as it didn’t even know what its parents looked like.</p>
 <p>She patted its horn and said, “My parents had also passed away. Both of us are similar, both meeting setbacks in a foreign land.”</p>
 <p>Immediately, the little qilin tried to curry her favor by rubbing her with its horn. “Then, in the future, let’s help each other…”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a bright idea hit him. It darted its big and bright eyes on Ning Xuemo. “Master, how about… how about you become my mother?”</p>
 <p>Ning Xuemo, “...” Her mind short-circuited by the thunderous words!</p>
 <p>“Little Apple, I’m only 13 years old and you? You’re more than 2,000 years old! Even if you have yet to mature, you can’t confuse me with your mother. I even feel terrified every time you call me big sister…”</p>
 <p>The little qilin drooped its head. “I know, but I always felt that you were like my mother. It made me want to be close to you…”</p>
 <p>Ning Xuemo repeatedly waved her hands. “Little Apple, what you feel is extremely wrong! I am completely human without a drop of qilin blood running through my veins. No matter how, it’s impossible for me to be even similar to your mother. My soul doesn’t belong to this era and a previous life doesn’t exist. Granted that it does exist, considering the difference in time, it would also be impossible for me to be the reincarnation of a qilin…”</p>
 <p>“My mother is not a qilin, only my father is…” The little qilin refuted.</p>
 <p>“What is your mother then?” <em>‘Is Little Apple a crossbreed?’</em></p>
 <p>“I don’t know…” The little qilin shook his head, dejected. “I don’t know. Everyone didn’t breathe a word about my mother. I only heard them say she was a malicious woman, but I believed that my mother is a good person. She’s absolutely not a bad person…”</p>
 <p>In a child’s eyes, their father and mother are the best people; they could not tolerate anyone bad mouthing them.</p>
 <p>The little qilin was also the same. It would beat up anyone who says its mother is bad.</p>
 <p>It came to the point that he would pick a fight everywhere in the clan, causing him to lose all his playmates, and in the end, he was even driven out...</p>
 <p>Ning Xuemo clearly understood his mind, so she stroked his horn to comfort him.</p>
 <p>She gazed at the crystal chains and nodded with a sigh. “Whoever made this crystal coffin must be a person with a refined artistic sense. I never expected that it was possible to play a tune with these chains. Huh? There’s a crack on the coffin lid!</p>
 <p>Her keen observation skills helped her spot the presence of the crack. As she observed some more, the crack formed the image of a tree, a tree with swaying branches and leaves.</p>
 <p><em>‘Don’t tell me that the mechanism to open the coffin is linked to this tree?’</em></p>
 <p>Ning Xuemo lowered her head and carefully studied the “tree”. Her whole attention was concentrated on the coffin cover, so she didn’t notice the eyelashes of the red-clothed man slightly trembling, like fluttering butterfly wings.</p>
 <p>Her fingers traced the tree at first. Then, she used her palm to gently stroke it. The motionless red-clothed man’s palms were pressed on the tree. As Ning Xuemo continued to stroke along the crack, her palms overlapped with his; only the transparent coffin lid separated their palms.</p>
 <p>Of course, Ning Xuemo noticed his hands: a pair of perfectly shaped hands endowed with long and slender fingers, setting a glaring contrast on the crystal, like some kind of sparkling and translucent mutton fat jade.</p>
 <p><em>‘Such beautiful hands!’ </em>If she had those hands, she could work as a hand model in her world.</p>
 <p><em>‘Oh! This person’s looks are also not bad. He has the qualities to be a teen idol: facial features look as picturesque as a painting, adding to an androgynous appearance.’ </em>If Ning Xuemo didn’t see his Adam’s apple and noticed his tall height, she would have believed she was looking at a beautiful girl...</p>
 <p><em>‘While he was alive, this person could be an evildoer that could collapse a country and ruin people. With such beauty, who knows how many hearts he broke.’</em></p>
 <p><em>‘Tsk! Tsk! To die at such a tender age, what a pity!’</em></p>
