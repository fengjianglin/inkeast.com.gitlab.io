 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo sneered. It appeared that Le Xuan Emperor fancied the little qilin and almost succeeded enlisting it under the imperial family’s possessions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Apple, humans are sinister creatures. If you don’t want your words to cause the extermination of your entire clan, you should never mention where your clan dwells to anyone! Not even half a hint should be divulged! Do you understand?” If the coordinates of the qilin’s sacred land were to be known, it was very likely that endless calamity and bloodbath would befall that place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin nodded. “I understand. The big brother that came with me in the stone essence spirit also said the same thing.” Therefore, it understood that point and kept himself from revealing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo relaxed her tone and remembered the sealed prince within the stone essence spirit. It seemed like that prince didn’t lack morality. As the Ancestor’s disciple, he was much better than that Ye Qingluan. </span><i><span style>Hum…</span></i><span style> For some reason, she always felt that she forgot something important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Apple, do you remember who helped us establish our blood contract?” She always felt there was another person accompanying her during the time she was in the stone essence spirit. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, no matter how much she tried, she couldn’t recall who it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin shook its head, at a loss. “I forgot. I only remembered that person was an expert…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course it was an expert! Otherwise, how could that person help them establish a blood contract that only a heaven realm expert could do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of expert? &nbsp;Do you still remember that person’s appearance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin shook its head. “I can’t remember.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They both couldn’t remember that expert’s appearance. Did that expert erase their memories before departing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo couldn’t understand no matter how much she thought about it, so she simply stopped pondering about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that expert really wanted to harm her, she would be unable to hide from it, so she might as well not fret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After instructing a few things to the little qilin, she waved her hand to let it go out and play. She also left her room to discover that after a day of sleep the whole mansion resumed to his former glorious appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servants that the old emperor rewarded her were all agile, attending to their duties: weeding, patrolling, cleaning, and sweeping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo strolled around the place, and no matter where she went everything was clean and well organized, and the servants were doing their work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most serious about their duties were those imperial guards who were following behind her and guarding her from a distance. Even when they were on standby, their formation was solid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s heart trembled and called Old Zhong, “Uncle Shu, who arranged these people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reporting to mistress, it was the newly hired youth, Xijue. He’s very capable. In less than half a day, he was able to control those prick-headed guards…” Old &nbsp;Zhong’s tone was full of praise for the teenager. This was an overpowered servant who delivered himself to their door!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although those imperial guards were not peak experts, each of them still possessed pretty good martial arts skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they considered themselves imperial guards, they would be unwilling to obey Old Zhong after being demoted to this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t dare to disobey the emperor, but it didn’t mean that they would care and follow Old Zhong’s arrangements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention those imperial cooks, palace maids and that gardener… None of them were easy to deal with. From the start, no one had the intention to work or give their best after entering the Marquis’ mansion as they were all arrogant iddlers shirking their responsibilities, going as far as mocking Old Zhong who was giving them tasks and glaring at that newly hired teenager Xijue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result, Xijue beat up the most arrogant and unruly of the imperial bodyguards. After beating him at least five times in a row, Xijue finally won over that guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of those prick-headed guards were honest; therefore, they all obeyed his orders.</span></p>
