 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was too late to retract her fingers, so she deviated the course of her fingers to the side. The place hit would still harm Shi Tianlong without a doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, it was a place that injured him a lot! Shi Tianlong groaned in pain; His body shook while black spots bursted in his field of view. In front of his eyes, Ning Xuemo became two...</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of that, his limbs became numb; his whole body felt weak. Not to mention saving someone, he couldn’t even support himself, and he gradually began sinking under the water.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hey! </span></i><span style>Was her ability this high now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly her counterattack had caused Shi Tianlong to be reduced into such a state.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Urgh!’ </span></i><span style>This was not the result she wanted!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was filled with depression. Right now, the other person couldn’t be the hero saving the damsel in distress. Thus, the damsel had no choice but to save the hero, otherwise the hero would drown in the lake!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She swam forward and stretched her arm out to fish him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether she saved him or he saved her, it didn’t matter since she could still get close to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her fingers had just barely touched Shi Tianlong’s arm, and had yet to exert some force to pull him up when all of a sudden, a cold sensation could be felt on her back. Her lower back went numb! It was as if something had touched her and in a split second drained her of all her strength.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What’s going on?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was greatly alarmed; Two people falling into water and neither having any strength, so to speak, was a life-threatening situation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had yet to use some strength when she heard a splash of water. Shi Tianlong, who was within her reach, suddenly soared out of the water into the air as if someone had illogically pulled him out...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo helplessly watched as her idol was yanked out of the water by a mysterious force and like a tornado, his body flew to the shore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed to perceive something, thus she used all her strength to turn her sight towards the shore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the moonlight, there was a person standing on the shore. His black hair was like a waterfall spilling along his gown while fluttering under the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because the distance from the shore was quite far, she couldn’t clearly see his face nor could she determine the color of his gown. Yet, Ning Xuemo could immediately recognize the person : Han Shanyue!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was her enemy who inexplicably appeared so often in front of her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, he lightly waved his sleeve and Shi Tianlong’s body spun under the movements of his hands. </span><i><span style>Plaf! </span></i><span style>Shi Tianlong was thrown onto the shore!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately his skin was rough and his flesh thick, being thrown like this was a mere trifle and basically caused him no harm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He rolled on the shore, then vigorously crawled up before he greeted Han Shanyue with haste, “Many thanks Teacher!” Both had already met, therefore Shi Tianlong recognized Han Shanyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue’s sight fell on Shi Tianlong and slightly narrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face was concealed by the darkness, so Shi Tianlong couldn’t clearly see his expression. However, his intuition as a practiced martial artist told him that this mysterious and formidable Teacher Han Shanyue was emitting a killing intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It caused him to burst into shivers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he didn’t understand the reason for this killing intent, he was very concerned about another matter. He hastily greeted Han Shanyue again, “Teacher, there’s someone still in the lake. May I inconvenience Teacher to save her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone else? Where?” Han Shanyue rarely spoke, his tone was monotone and flat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just the-” Shi Tianlong pointed towards the lake, but his voice suddenly choked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lake surface was flat as a mirror, not a single trace of Ning Xuemo could be seen!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘How terrible! She must have sank to the bottom!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This lake was very deep. For a young girl like her to sink to the bottom, how could she survive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A buzzing sound resounded inside Shi Tianlong’s brain. He was a hot-blooded, chivalrous man. Even if it was someone else, he would go save them, not to mention that the person was the daughter of Marquis Ning whom he admired the most!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He silently pondered seriously about jumping into the water again. “She sank to the bottom… This general will go save her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you certain you can still go into the water?” Han Shanyue’s voice was as cold as the moon in the sky.</span></p>
