 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 148 - Snakes and Scorpions Mountain</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The situation was certainly strange. At their feet and sides, snakes were crawling yet not a single one attacked them, instead treating them as if they didn’t exist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without question, it was certainly the work of that unknown liquid Ning Xuemo had sprayed on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Number Two had incomparable admiration for Ning Xuemo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normal girls were afraid of snakes. He had once seen a psychokinesis genius who was a young lady scream herself hoarse, sounding like a pig being butchered when she saw a snake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that they were in a snake nest, even he was scared to the point of paling and only managed to keep his legs from trembling by exerting tremendous self-control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ning Xuemo, this little girl, was at such ease despite being in the midst of a swarm of snakes. Her movements were light and easy, while her face didn’t even have a change in expression or colour. Even when a one-meter-long snake fell from a tree branch above them onto her neck, scaring Number Two into a cold sweat, Ning Xuemo didn’t even blink as she stood there ignoring the snake as it wound itself around her and onto the ground…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Which bastard said Marquis Ning’s daughter was weak and cowardly without a single merit?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Whoever said that was simply blind!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>From all that he witnessed on this journey with her, this girl was simply an all-round wonderful genius!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smart, wise, brave and a careful planner. Not to mention, she had a mind far remote from the common people and resourceful!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was not any worse than her father when he was alive. Whoever could marry her simply had </span><span style>luck accumulated through eight generations<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pity that his prince didn’t have this kind of luck and had given up this outstanding girl…</span></p>
 <p><span style>And it was in this situation where there were a few scares but no real dangers that they made their way through the swarm of snakes. Although Number Two had been scared into breaking out in cold sweat, he still managed to hold on. Other than a pale white face, he was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was the liquid you sprayed on us earlier? They seemed to treat us as their kind…” Number Two couldn’t help getting curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lifted her snow white finger to her lips as she smiled. “Secret~! It’s my own formula.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two was silent. Since it was a secret, it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to continue inquiring, so he simply looked back in front and asked, “There should still be scorpions ahead right? Will this scent on our bodies still be useful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re using another one.” Ning Xuemo replied concisely. She brought out two other small medicinal bottles and used one bottle for each of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smell this time was even more off-putting than the previous one. The foul stench nearly caused Number Two to sneeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why does it smell like chicken shit?” Number Two nearly wanted to pinch his nose; this stench will kill him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyes curved. “Do you want to scare off scorpions with a foul stench or invite them to dine on you by smelling good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fine, he’ll endure this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already gone deep into the mountain top, and they finally got to see what the scorpions here looked like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of scorpions was far fewer than the number of snakes. Furthermore, they acted alone more often than the snakes. Large ones could reach the size of a pipa, while small ones were still at least as large as a circular fan. Their movements were swift like lightning. Their upraised tails were smooth seemed like a raised flag…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two’s heart could not be at ease. He knew that his body smelled like a giant chicken, and he knew that people said that scorpions were afraid of chickens. But, all of these scorpions were larger than chickens, would this stench still deter them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was clear that he was thinking too much. A natural enemy was a natural enemy; the scorpions here were simply scared of chickens… That is, they were scared off by the smell of chicken shit on Number Two and Ning Xuemo’s bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wherever they went, the scorpions there would hurriedly flee, and in a blink of an eye, they would burrow themselves into the underbrush. It was simply a case where reality defied expectations…</span></p>
