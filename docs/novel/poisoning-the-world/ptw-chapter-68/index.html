 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 68 -&nbsp;Committing Mistake After Mistake (1)</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The skin on that girl’s hand was in ruins and only the piece intact was the part covering the thumb. It might have been because of the pain, but her hands trembled as she tolerated it and strenuously managed to write out a few words, which caused the four jailers to be thoroughly incensed!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>What she wrote was: I am Tu Yidao!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style> Your Mother! At this time, she was actually trying to pose as their Chief!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Those four were not polite and immediately initiated another round of torture, letting her wallow in hell for a few rounds, before another confession paper was taken out for her to sign.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>But they had not thought that after writing those same words again, she would even add another line: I am Tu Yidao. She plotted against me, taking my face to pose as me…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>The pain made her unable to write properly, causing the words to look like dog scratchings. Fortunately, those four people could still read it.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>At first, they thought that she intentionally caused trouble; hence everyone, apart from Old Three, cursed angrily and wanted to start another round of torture…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Old Three was rather careful though and stopped them, “Could it be real?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Just now, he had acted the most. Although her skin had already been cut into tattered pieces, &nbsp;he faintly felt as if it wasn’t that of a young girl’s…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>The four of them looked at each other and reined in their impulses before carefully examining ‘her’…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>After a moment, all four slowly retreated a step.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Although the features of the person being tortured had been ruined beyond recognition, these four had their experiences built on torturing countless people and possessed an exceptional understanding about the human anatomy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>A few features could clearly be seen not to belong to a female. Furthermore, this person was not young…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Could it be that their Chief was really swapped with Ning Xuemo ?!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>The one that they had wholeheartedly tortured was their Chief Tu Yidao?!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Four pairs of eyes landed on the tortured person.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>The tortured person &nbsp;held a faint look of hope in his eyes, and without caring about the pain, he frantically tried to make some hand signals. They were the hand signals they often used, which outsiders would have no way of knowing about.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Because he was nailed to the wall, his range of movement was restricted, causing his movements to be exceptionally slow. However, they were not the slightest bit different from their hand signals.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Old Three blurted out, “Heavens, it’s really our Chief!” He wanted to leap over to help him off the wall.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>However, the leader of their group stopped him. Sullenly looking at that person before suddenly smiling coldly he said, “You still want to pose as our Chief. You must be tired of living! Old Two and Old Fourth, go prepare the dismembering tools. It seems like she’s the real deal, actually not wanting to confess!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>They definitely could not acknowledge that it was Tu Yidao!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Tu Yidao’s character was cold and vindictive. He would seek vengeance for the smallest things.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>When they had been unaware of the situation, they had inflicted a lot of torture on him. According to his character, he would definitely harbour hatred in his heart, and if they let him go, they would inevitably suffer his cruel revenge!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Since it was like this, then they could only keep committing mistake after mistake.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>The other three also understood this. So after glancing at each other, they also decided to go along with it…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>Tu Yidao fell into despair. All these tortures had been carefully honed and enhanced by him; however, he would not have thought that he would have a taste of it today. Furthermore, the ones who were torturing him knew who he was but actually went ahead with it. This was what caused him to despair!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>He would not be able to survive those torture methods! In addition, those four people would definitely not let him survive. They had already decided to press further with that mistake.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>If he wanted to receive less pain, then he should just go ahead with their idea and sign the confession…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style>When he finally accepted his fate and signed the confession, those four people let out sighs of relief. They brought him down from the wall and dragged him into a quiet room, as if they were dragging a dead dog. They forced him to imitate Ning Xuemo’s handwriting and to write a letter saying that she wanted to commit suicide to avoid punishment…</span></p>
