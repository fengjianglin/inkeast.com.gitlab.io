 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 317 - Do You Like Him? (4)</b></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>It goes without saying that Ning Xuemo didn’t want to believe it. However, she remembered the demise of the former Ning Xuemo’s parents and the early death of her older brother. She heard that when she was born, her older brother died on the battlefield during the same year.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Spot on! She totally fit the meaning of those unlucky words of being the “bane of others’ existence”!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, the former Ning Xuemo was already dead. So, shouldn’t her fate change as a result?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe her transmigration had already altered the former’s fate. At least, the people currently close to her were still alive and well...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Ji Yunhuang also heard Ning Xuemo’s life fortune from Han Shanyue. His complexion slightly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words of Great Master Han Shanyue were similar to the words left by the Ancestor to his imperial father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang remembered that before the Ancestor left, Le Xuan Emperor was prompted by a sudden impulse to invite the Ancestor to foretell Ning Xuemo’s fate in life. In the end, the Ancestor only left seven words, “A lone millennium phoenix roaming under heaven.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Ancestor openly spoke, he strutted away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it sent Le Xuan Emperor in a state of daze for no less than half a day. Subsequently, Le Xuan Emperor sent an order to revoke the decree of bestowing Ning Xuemo the title of imperial concubine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Le Xuan Emperor sternly admonished Ji Yunhuang and warned him not to have any thoughts toward Ning Xuemo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, he was skeptical about that divination and didn’t particularly take to heart his imperial father’s warning. Thus, right after being admonished, he continued to search all over the place for Ning Xuemo, while she was still in Heavenly Book Mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he knew that Ning Xuemo tamed a young qilin, he felt that she was quite unique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A qilin was not only a divine beast, but also an auspicious animal. Legend said that wherever that beast appeared, the land would prosper and be peaceful...</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought he could use the fact that Ning Xuemo had tamed a young qilin to make his imperial father change his mind and agree to let him take Ning Xuemo as his princess. However, he never thought that this iron-mouthed<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Han Shanyue would knock him on the head with those words!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness! Your Highness! Not good your Highness! Princess had an accident…” All of a sudden from downstairs, the flustered voice of a young woman resounded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang’s expression slightly changed. He heard the shout of the young woman, who was Ji Yunyao’s personal maid. He couldn’t stop himself from glancing at Ning Xuemo. “Xuemo…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo waved her hand. “Your Highness should hurry. There’s no need for you to take care of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang paused. He still wanted to say something, but the maid downstairs urged him with the following words, “Your Highness, I beseech you to go see princess quickly. She… Princess really had an accident…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang deeply sighed, “Xuemo, I’ll go first. I’ll come look for you later.” His figure flashed, and he went down the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was stumped as she watched Ji Yunhuang’s back. Although right now she didn’t have any feelings for him, seeing that he readily threw her on the side in a place with a pack of wolves eyeing her, she felt a bit disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you like him?” Han Shanyue’s voice was neither strong nor light; it was difficult to determine his mood from his tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...like.” Ning Xuemo replied smoothly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue appeared as if he was choked by her bluntness. Then, he indifferently said, “You have no future together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo smiled. She suddenly crouched and grabbed the little qilin that was on the chair. </span><i><span style>Smooch! </span></i><span style>She kissed the little qilin on its nose. “I also like this little one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin became emotional to the point that it almost turned back to its original form. Its blue eyes were glistening and limpid. “Master…” Its blue fur almost turned into a pink shade.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Heh! Master kissed me. Master smells good!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin narrowed its eyes from happiness. It raised its head and accidentally met with Han Shanyue’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A burst of cold shivers seized it. It retracted its neck, lowered its tail, and recoiled back in the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue lightly said, “So your like is that kind of like. Do you kiss anyone you like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo smiled. “I prefer to kiss the cuter ones, just like this one…”</span></p>
