 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Ning Xuemo’s ankle was searing in pain. The little qilin could sense that her condition wasn’t great. It hurriedly ran to her aid and acted as her support. Ning Xuemo flipped and landed on the little qilin’s back. Then, once again, she glanced at Ji Yunhuang. “Do you believe her words?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang stiffened. His look turned faintly complicated when he met Ning Xuemo’s gaze. “Yunyao would never lie in front of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo laughed. She bent her head while glancing at the two of them. “If it’s going to be like that, then why bother asking me in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, she relied on that little qilin. She thinks that with that bargaining chip, she could look down on all of us. Earlier, she said that we… unpleasant things about our relationship! It’s nothing if it’s only me since I’m just a princess. But you, you are Vast Sky Empire’s Crown Prince. You reputation couldn’t be dirtied by even a speck of bad rumors. You were so good to her, but she bit the hand that fed her. She’s too much!” Ji Yunyao raised her tear-stained little face and continued to accuse Ning Xuemo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of so many people, Ji Yunhuang’s handsome face darkened. The look he gave Ning Xuemo turned cold. “Ning Xuemo, apologize!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already experienced Ning Xuemo’s craftiness and shrewdness. With that kind of sly temperament, she actually dared to provoke and even beat up someone! Not to mention whoever’s reputation, she could also dare ruin...</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is exactly that kind of personality that attracted him to her. However, right now, he felt that she was making a joke out of him. It seemed like it was indeed his fault for indulging her too much!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo slightly raised her head. She looked at Ji Yunhuang for a split of second before her lips hooked into a faint smile. “What if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted her to apologize to that princess? </span><i><span style>‘Dream on, Bro!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although there was a smile hung on her charming face, her gaze was icy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang took in a deep breath. “You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will not apologize to her!” Ning Xuemo’s tone turned colder and sharper as she said that sentence. “I only regret I didn’t finish her earlier because I was still soft on her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on her real temper, how can she allow a person like Ji Yunyao to live?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo unexpectedly dared to refute him! She even went as far as to say those words to him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang watched at his bloodstained little sister in his arms. Then, once again watched Ning Xuemo’s highly raised little face. His fingers slowly clenched into a fist. “Ning Xuemo, </span><i><span style>benwang </span></i><span style>will repeat again, apologize! Properly apologize to Yunyao now! Otherwise, </span><i><span style>benwang</span></i><span style>…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Otherwise, what? You want to take her place to beat me?!” Anger bursted inside Ning Xuemo’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had already heard that Ji Yunhuang was extremely doting toward his little sister. Every time she caused trouble, as long as he was there, he would pay no heed to her wrongdoings and protected her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, she was still skeptical, but at present, it appeared that the rumors were true...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hahaha!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang hardly imagined that in front of so many people that this little girl dared to challenge his bottom line!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contrary to his gentle and cultivated appearance, his true nature was actually proud and arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunyao had taken the opportunity to fan the flames further, causing Ji Yunhuang’s anger to rise to a higher level!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This little girl is extremely undisciplined and out of control!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Did she seriously believe that he won’t do anything to her?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his anger boiled, he pointed at Ning Xuemo. “Ning Xuemo, you have greatly disappointed me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time an indigo light shot out from his palm, transforming into a giant hand in midair, slapping toward Ning Xuemo!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i><span style> The palm strike landed on Ning Xuemo’s side!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s face paled. Her body swayed on the qilin’s back. Her blood rushed in her throat. Despite having forcefully swallowed that mouthful of blood, she was however unable to stop a small thread of blood from slipping through the corner of her mouth...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang also never expected that his palm strike could actually hit his target. He froze, then suddenly couldn’t help but take a step forward. “Xuemo…” With her inner force and qinggong, she should have been able to dodge that palm strike!</span></p>
