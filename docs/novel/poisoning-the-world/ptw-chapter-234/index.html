 <p></p>
 <p>This medicine was effective. The blood stopped flowing almost as soon as the powder touched the wound.</p>
 <p>Jiu Zun looked at the bottle before looking at the wound on her hand and nodded. “This medicine is not bad, where did you get it from?”</p>
 <p>Ning Xuemo was feeling dispirited.&nbsp;<span style>“It’s just something I made.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know how to make medicine?” He thought that her medical skills were only a bit higher. He had personally seen her handle wounds and noticed that her movements were very practised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” Ning Xuemo replied these two words before looking at the sharp edge of the grass. Shifting her gaze to her own shoes, she asked. “These shoes appear to be weaved from this type of grass, so why don’t they cut my feet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The sharp edges were already dealt by </span><i><span style>benzun</span></i><span style>.” Jiu Zun lightly cast another glance at her feet. “Otherwise, your feet would be a bloody mess by now!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘So, these shoes were personally weaved by Jiu Zun using this grass! I didn’t think that this fellow had this kind of ability!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His status was so high, but to think that he could roast wild game and weave grass sandals. It really was out of her expectations!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t help but glance at Jiu Zun a few times. As if he knew what she was thinking, Jiu Zun got up while tossing her this sentence. “Your shoes were made using a transformation technique. So don’t think too much about it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it was made using a transformation technique, she still liked them. As long as they didn’t turn into a bunch of grass while she was walking, Ning Xuemo didn’t mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was inconvenient for her to bandage her wound with one hand, she simply presented her finger in front of Jiu Zun. “Here, help me bandage it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was too used to ordering around her subordinates in her previous life, thus she didn’t have any qualms ordering Jiu Zun around. She didn’t even feel anything was amiss with her tone and attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiu Zun glanced at her. He felt that he had been indulging this girl a bit too much, so this time he ignored her and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Apple stepped forward to volunteer. “Little Big Sister, let me do it.” It rolled on the ground, wanting to take the opportunity to turn back into human form, yet it hadn’t expected that after a few tries, it was still in its qilin form.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What’s going on?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin blinked its eyes as it examined its body, its face filled with confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to look anymore. </span><i><span style>Benzun</span></i><span style> has cast a spell on your body. You won’t be able to take human form for the next 10 years.” Jiu Zun’s words gave the little qilin a nasty shock!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Why?” The little qilin was so angry it stuttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With your current strength, taking on a human form would only exhaust your cultivation. Besides, did you think </span><i><span style>benzun</span></i><span style>’s conditions were a joke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How… how could you be like this?! I want to turn into a human…” The little qilin’s eyes teared up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiu Zun’s right hand made a hand seal as he calmly gazed at it. “Stop crying! Haven’t your elders ever taught you that a man can shed blood but not tears?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin was stunned. It seemed like Jiu Zun had hit a sore spot. “No one taught me! All they do is look down on me, calling me a bastard and mixed blood…” As it spoke, its voice was choked with sobs. “They all say I’m the jinx of the entire Qilin Clan, so they aren’t willing to care about me. They even chased me out…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo hadn’t thought that the little qilin would have such a heartbreaking past. It seems like divine beast societies were the same as human societies, with all sorts of unfair treatments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted her hand to pat its head. “Don’t be upset. From now on, no one will bully you ever again.” It was her first pet in this world. Furthermore, since their fates were intertwined, she would protect it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Jiu Zun was disagreeable. His tone remained cold. “This is natural selection. If you want others to change their attitudes towards you, you have to get stronger. You have to rely on your own strength in order to make them listen!”</span></p>
