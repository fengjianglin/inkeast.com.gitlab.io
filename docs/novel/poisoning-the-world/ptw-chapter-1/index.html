 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>On a cloudless day, the scorching sunlight shining down was like a fire roasting Mother Earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the middle of the blue-stoned public square, there was a tall and big iron cage. Lying&nbsp;in the iron cage was a little girl with fine black hair covering her face. She didn’t move even as her blood dripped down from her body until it formed a small pool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did she die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She deserves to be beaten to death. That girl should feel ashamed, if not, it will turn very unsightly in a while!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like she really did take in a lover. If that wasn’t the case, it’s unlikely she would commit suicide out of a guilty conscience. An easy death like this is truly too convenient for this kind of slut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right! This slut absolutely doesn’t know the meaning of being ashamed. The noble and righteous Sixth Prince knew that she was a waste of resources with no father and mother, and he still agreed to marry her and let her become an imperial concubine. It is the biggest grace someone like her could have. Unexpectedly, she still went and cheated on him. It truly made Marquis Ning lose all his face!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a pity we can’t see the chastity testing beast shreds that slut into pieces.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The buzzing of discussion sounded like a thousands flies flying around.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘So noisy! Noisy to death!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo woke up dizzy from hearing a downpour of all kinds of insults. Not only did the noise make her forehead hurt, it also hurt her brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Which bastards dared disturb her sleep?! They were truly tired of living!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, shut up! If you disturb me once more, I’ll let all of you go drink tea with King Yama!” She shook her head while shouting loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It must be those subordinates of her. If she didn’t poison them for several days, they would dare tease her again! However, she seriously had a lot of difficulty breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the shout resounded, the surroundings became silent as expected!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lightly curved the corner of her mouth. </span><i><span style>‘As expected, this trick is still efficacious.’</span></i><span style> After all, she was the secret service’s old-timer and not some phoney. When she got somewhat furious, they would automatically become well-behaved like little chicks. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘EH?! Something is wrong!’ </span></i><span style>Her voice… </span></p>
 <p><span style>How come her voice was awfully hoarse? Her throat was painfully burning as if she just swallowed half a kilogram of sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She wasn’t dead! Unexpectedly, this slut didn’t die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! It looks like even this bitch is reluctant to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, she can still curse people! Who does she think she is, huh?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” All of a sudden, the quiet surroundings started hurling insults once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s body stiffened. Finally, she opened her eyes and slowly lifted her head. She remained calm and collected, while sweeping a look all around of her. In the blink of an eye, she already understood her unfavorable situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the hot weather, her cage was surrounded by three rows of people who enjoyed watching the bustling scene. These people were dressed like commoners that could be seen in whichever historical drama. Every one of their face was filled with excitement at the possibility of enjoying a good show like they were on steroids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was like a monkey in a zoo, a captive in a burning hot iron cage, surrounded and watched by all these people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was going on? She clearly was sleeping at home. How did she arrive to this place when she opened her eyes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo became somewhat dumbfounded as she kept looking at her surroundings. She couldn’t help but raised her hand to massage her head, but then she felt the sticky blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her vision abruptly focused on her small hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hand was very small, pale and delicate with a small callus inside her palm. Her fingernails appeared to have an unhealthy light blue-color.</span></p>
