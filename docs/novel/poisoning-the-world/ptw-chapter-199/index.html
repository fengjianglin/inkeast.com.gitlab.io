 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">While the two were having this conversation, another lizard-shaped beast was exterminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lizard’s attack speed was extremely quick and the fireballs it spit out were no joke; They could even melt stones in an instant!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Ning Xuemo had to deal with it on her own, she would not even be able to take one of its attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she had this little ginseng spirit to help her. They co-operated without a hitch. She was in charge of dodging the attacks that came their way, while he was in charge of sending out attacks. In only two or three moves, that lizard went to meet its maker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo had not held much hope for walking out of the 9th mountain before. But now, her confidence received a large boost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this little guy by her side, it was like she was using game cheats! Battles were much more straightforward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had to think of a way to keep him by her side...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Jiu Zun, do you have any plans for the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t called me little!” ‘Does this damn girl have to add this word?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, Jiu Zun, you aren’t thinking of spending your whole life on this mountain right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s unlikely.” Jiu Zun was extremely frank.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘That’s good! It seems like this ginseng spirit wanted to explore the world.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Oh right, he knew about affairs that happened in the world so it seemed like he frequently descended the mountain...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiu Zun, you saw me naked!” Out of nowhere Ning Xuemo shot out this sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing worth seeing.” Jiu Zun gave the answer he thought most appropriate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo resisted the urge to toss him off, but she continued to reason with him. “Even if you didn’t see those parts, you still saw me naked! You know that, in this world, if a girl’s body was seen naked by others, it would be counted as losing their purity…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your point?” Jiu Zun’s dark blue eyes narrowed slightly, his voice containing a faint coldness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My point is you have to take responsibility.” Ning Xuemo replied in a righteous tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take responsibility? You mean marrying you?” No emotions were discernable in Jiu Zun’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need for that!” Ning Xuemo waved her finger. “It took you this long just to grow to this age, by the time you’re an adult I reckon I would have died and completely decomposed by then. I can’t wait that long!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She went in such a large circle yet she didn’t want him to marry her?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘She didn’t care about this?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Something flashed in Jiu Zun’s eyes but he continued speaking normally. “What do you have in mind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay by my side while I’m still in Tianshu Mountain. I can continue carrying you on my back.” Ning Xuemo stated her condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To her, carrying &nbsp;luggage that had a weight of 15 kg to 20 kg was child’s play.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little fellow was so light that it did not tire her out in the least to carry him. Even if she carried him, she would have a great protective umbrella, it was worth it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Benzun<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></i><span style>&nbsp;agrees to protect you for a day and </span>only<span style> a day!” Jiu Zun spoke in an indisputable tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was his bottom line. He had already made quite a few exceptions for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Tsk! Tsk! the little guy is really quite arrogant.’</span></i><span style> She had only called him “Jiu Zun” a few times and he started using “<em>benzun</em>”...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Fine then, a day is still a day.’</span></i><span style> It was enough for her to get all the way to the 6th mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style> From there, she could rely on her own abilities to go through the few other peaks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them had already reached the peak of the mountain. The sun already reached its apex in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That one day of protection had just begun, she still had plenty of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, one day then. It’s one whole day, 24 whole hours. You can’t leave me until this time tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiu Zun’s brows furrowed slightly. “Only for the daytime.” He still had other things to do at night and wouldn’t be able to accompany her then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, one daytime is only half a day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One daytime.” Jiu Zun was too lazy to negotiate with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Forget it!’</span></i><span style> Ning Xuemo also knew that although this fellow was small, he stubbornly abided by his words. Since he had already made up his mind, it would not be easy to get him to change his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she ran a bit faster, she would probably be able to make it in half a day...</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the time it took to have this conversation, they had finally reached the mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The area on the peak was not extremely large. Bypassing a large stone, Ning Xuemo saw a different scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And then… her expression became like this ?!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="1"></a>[1]&nbsp;<span style><em>Zun</em> (</span><span style>?) means honour/respect. <em>Ben</em> (?) in this context means ‘this’ and is usually attached in front of other characters to form a way for respected personages to call themselves. Like a prince or king would use <em>benwang</em> (??), the empress could use <em>bengong</em> (??). Hence,&nbsp;<em>benzun</em> means ‘this honoured person’.</span></p>
