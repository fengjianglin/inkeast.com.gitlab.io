 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> There was still another falcon. Its mate had died in her hands so it would definitely seek revenge. When Ning Xuemo surfaced, she was already prepared, the sharp stone in her hand held in a ready stance to guard against the male falcon’s attack. She was planning to use that opportunity to grab onto that falcon’s leg...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Eeek~”</span></i><span style> She heard the sharp shrieking of the male falcon. Its large body took to the skies and in just a short while, turning into a small black dot before disappearing...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo “...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Weren’t falcons supposed to be the most loyal and devoted in love?’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘One monogamous pair for life, when its mate died it wouldn’t continue living…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A famous poet had even once wrote a famous poem about it: 'Ask the world, what is love, for a couple to share life and death. A pair flying from the southern sky to the northern land, how many times have their old wings experienced the cold winter and the scorching summer? Together is bliss, bitter is the parting…'<a href="#1"><sup>[1][2]</sup></a></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Such a classic poem from ancient times was actually a lie?! Can you not be this deceptive?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it didn’t commit suicide to join its mate in death, at the very least it should take revenge for her death! Just what was it doing by flapping its wings and taking off?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo felt her three views<a href="#1"><sup>[3]</sup></a> collapsing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and get up here. In just a few hours, you’ve already jumped thrice into this lake now.” A cool voice sounded from above her head; it was the child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo hopped onto the shore, whereupon she discovered a special property of her clothing. They were actually waterproof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she had made her way to the shore, her clothes remained as elegant as before. Furthermore, they were not stained with even a bit of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little guy was very generous to have actually given her such a great set of clothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She beamed as she hauled the little guy off the rock and smacked a kiss on his lips. “<em>Memeda</em>, darling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little child “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He calmly lifted his hand to wipe his lips. He hasn’t even known her for a day and already had three kisses stolen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him feel ashamed was that he was actually somewhat getting used to it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t as adverse to her “surprise attack” as the previous two times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know his identity so he just let her kiss him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Memeda means kiss?” He asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Hn!</span></i><span style>” Ning Xuemo answered before excitedly setting him down. Her eyes looked at the large bird floating in the middle of the water. “This is the first creature in the 9th mountain that I killed myself. I’m going to go get its crystal core!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had already rolled up her sleeves when the child immediately stopped her. “There’s no time for that! If you don’t want to be surrounded by a group of beasts, you should leave quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo knew that his experience on this mountain was plentiful, so she didn’t continue questioning and simply lifted her arms to hug him. “I’ll carry you and run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the little guy had some ability, his legs were too short and wouldn’t be able to keep up with her pace...</span></p>
 <p><span style>His body slightly dodged. “Carrying me with your arms won’t be convenient, carry me on your back instead!” Without waiting for a reply, he jumped onto her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which direction will get us out of the mountain quicker?” Ning Xuemo asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To the east!” He was obviously very familiar with this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo immediately started sprinting towards the east.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She only just made it to the mountain pass before she heard the howls of many wild beasts behind her. The invisible killing intent in the howls caused the ground under her feet to tremble slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the sounds of it, the types of creatures that entered the valley weren’t from the same species. None of them chased after her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo let out a faint sigh of relief. Fortunately, she had run away fast enough!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, with her small body, she wouldn’t be enough for those beasts to share.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the east, there was no path only a fan-shaped cliff. The cliff was extremely steep but luckily there was plenty of vegetation to serve as footholds. Ning Xuemo’s qinggong was good, so ascending the cliff wasn’t too arduous.</span></p>
