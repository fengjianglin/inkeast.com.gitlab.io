 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>If this kind of person wanted to take Ning Xuemo’s life, she won’t even have the chance to escape...</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>She’s just a child, and going up against this kind of Big Boss was like a mantis trying to stop a carriage or an ant trying to shake a tree. In other words, it was completely impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two nodded. He told Ning Xuemo about the few times Ye Qingluan used Soul Summoning Art on her dead disciples to learn about their murderers and then how she used brutal methods to take revenge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every story was extremely disturbing, and all offenders met death in the most gruesome ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among those stories, there was one about a certain prince who inadvertently killed a disciple from Bright Reverence. Bright Reverence took their revenge by burning him to death on the city wall. What’s more, even though the emperor of that country got angry, he did not dare say a word...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo slightly frowned. It seems that Ye Qingluan, compared to her about-to-be-extinct master, was much more of a sadistic pervert. She acted like such a tyrant, but the Ancestor did not discipline her. It could be inferred that there must be some special feelings between them...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did the Ancestor expel Ye Qingluan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two shook his head. “This is an old story from three hundred years ago. Nobody knows about the real reason, and both Sun Moon Sect and Bright Reverence have their lips sealed tightly. I only heard that the Ancestor only took her in as a disciple for three years before expelling her. Then she disappeared…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xuemo heard that piece of gossip, she became overflowed with interest. “Do you know if she wants to return to her master’s sect? After all, she already became the founding ancestor of her sect which also possesses numerous benefits! She can restrain the disciples and have control over them…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two sighed, “Ye… Senior Ye’s wish to return to Sun Moon Sect is something the whole continent knows. It couldn’t be helped that the Venerable Emperor did not yield to her wish, going as far as to avoid seeing her. I heard Senior Ye used all kind of methods but still cannot meet with him…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This Ancestor is really outwardly cold and inwardly lovable!’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘It seems that Ye Qingluan really loved the Ancestor!’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Then the Ancestor shouldn’t be completely heartless towards her?’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Otherwise, he would not have indulged her as she ran amok…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps, it might just be the issue of them being master and disciple. He could not allow a stain his reputation; therefore, to save his almighty reputation, he decisively cut off his entanglement with Ye Qingluan by expelling her from the sect. However, inside his heart he also might not be able to let go?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Even though three hundred years have passed, he still does not know how to repair that relationship!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he expelled Ye Qingluan, he no longer received another female disciple, making her his sole female disciple...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Tsk! Tsk! This situation is somewhat cliché!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like she came across some kind of Xianxia’s drama plot...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did not expect that coming to this world she would see such clichés in real life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh right, is Ye Qingluan married? What about the Ancestor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number Two, seemingly puzzled, looked at her. “Although Senior Ye’s personality is a bit… odd, she has her bottom line and wouldn’t come in contact with any males. Of course she wouldn’t get married either. She has a lot of female disciples. Even if she accepted male disciples, the female disciples would teach them in her place. Hence, the position of her male disciples are a bit lower. As for the Ancestor… the Ancestor is a deity, how would any regular mortal woman deserve him? Naturally he hasn’t married anyone either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this teacher and disciple pair didn’t see each other, the man didn’t marry and neither did the woman… </span><i><span style>Ahh!</span></i><span style> What a tragic master-disciple relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two spoke while travelling and soon made their way to the foot of Falling Flower Peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An odd herb grew on Falling Flower Peak. It was called Heavenly Ice Grass. When used alongside a few other herbs, it had the ability to change one’s physique with the effects of cleansing the meridians and altering the marrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was what Ning Xuemo had researched recently. She had already prepared the other herbs, and the only one missing was just this special herb from Falling Flower Peak. Furthermore, this herb could not be preserved for too long or it would lose its effectiveness. It had to be eaten within a few moments together with the other herbs.</span></p>
