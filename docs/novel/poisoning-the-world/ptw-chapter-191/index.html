 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Her face gradually regained its healthy complexion, a clear sign that she was getting better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For almost two hours, he hugged her while he helped her heal before he finally managed to nourish her meridians back to health. After a final check to ensure that there were no problems, he finally released her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He staggered as soon as he stood up. His gait was unstable. A white light flashed from his body and the white-clothed man disappeared. Where he had stood before, now stood the ‘little ginseng spirit’ that Ning Xuemo wanted to use as a tonic....</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared blankly for a moment before the corner of his lips twitched! He cast an unkind gaze at Ning Xuemo who was sleeping peacefully.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This little girl…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was she his nemesis?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, he only needed to cultivate here for three more days before he restored his original strength, but he was unexpectedly interrupted at the last moment by her. He got hugged and tied up by her and had even continuously used psychokinesis to defend her as well as treat her injuries...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because he had never experienced such a situation before, he had no idea how to handle it. Earlier, he believed that it should not be a problem for him to restore his adult form, so he once again used his psychokinesis. He never thought that there would be such a serious side-effect! He turned into a little boy again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when would he be able to return into an adult?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he lifted his head to stare at the sky, the sky was already turning white. It would soon be daybreak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, the restriction barrier would disappear and the beasts in the Ninth mountain would show themselves once again. But since he used up his powers, he wouldn’t be able to lay down another array.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without his protection, this little girl wouldn’t last long on the Ninth mountain! It seemed like he could only try to send her out of the mountain for now...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What a troublesome little girl!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was woken up by a slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and get up, more magical beasts are coming!” The voice was crisper than unripe grapes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ning Xuemo heard “magical beast”, she couldn’t help but become alert and hurriedly leapt to her feet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are the magical beasts?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze scanned the surroundings before suddenly becoming stunned!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She… Did she transmigrate again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already daybreak. The bright red sun was in the middle of peaking out from behind a distant mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though she still stood next to the lake, it wasn’t the beautifully dream-like lake from last night but an expansive pool surrounded on three sides by steep peaks covered in gnarled dragon-shaped trees. The colour of the trees’ bark was a dreary gray with green everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, although not all the trees were of the same species, they were undoubtedly mostly similar to pines and cypresses with their needle-like leaves. And the strange large tree with palm-sized leaves from last night had disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many differently sized waterfalls gushed down from the mountain tops and flowed into the lake pool at Ning Xuemo’s feet. The sound of water was like thunder with water spraying everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Where is it?’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Where were those mystical beast-shaped mountains? Where was that beautiful large lake?’</span></i><span style> Why couldn’t she see them anymore?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘The events from last night couldn’t have been a dream right?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze landed on the crystal core near her feet. One end was greyish white while the other end was still green, appearing extremely bizarre. That was the psychokinesis crystal core she dug out from the weird dragon last night...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze swept over her surroundings once again. The weird dragon’s mangled corpse was still there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything pointed that last night was not a dream but reality.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘That’s right! Where did that little ginseng spirit go?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo rapidly searched her surroundings but couldn’t see him anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was sure he called her when she was unconscious! Could it be that it was only her imagination?</span></p>
