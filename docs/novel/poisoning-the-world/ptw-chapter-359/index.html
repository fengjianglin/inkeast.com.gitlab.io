 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, she did not reject it and happily accepted the old Emperor’s imperial edict. </span></p>
 <p><span style>…….................</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the sun had set in the west, Ning Xuemo dressed herself beautifully and left on the grand palanquin that was prepared for special guests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just before leaving, she turned around to look at the manor again. </span><span style>Even now, Xijue, who was always by her side still had not appeared. It could not be that she had angered him to the point that he fled, right? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Because she had not seen him for a day, she went to ask Old Zhong. Old Zhong told her that Xijue had left the manor last night and had not returned since. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue’s whereabouts were always a bit of a mystery. Even if he was in the manor, he was still never seen. However, when Ning Xuemo ever left the manor or met with something dangerous, he was always there, like some teleportation god. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Today was the first time this has happened. </span></p>
 <p><span style><em>'Could it be that he really left?'</em></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo shook her head and got on the palanquin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, she had originally told Xijue before that he would be free to go whenever and she would not restrict him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But not even saying a farewell before leaving, is that not a little too disloyal? </span></p>
 <p><span style>He really still is a young child. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin, on the other hand, is always there, sprawled right beside her. </span><span style>It had long been enchanted by the thoughts of delicious food at the banquet. </span><span style>Currently, it was blabbering on to Ning Xuemo about the food it wanted to eat… </span></p>
 <p><span style>The palanquin quickly reached Fragrant Pavilion, which was the location that the Emperor was hosting the banquet at. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragrant Pavilion was also the Imperial family’s gardens and the style of it was very similar to the Qing dynasty’s Summer Palace. Aside from the Imperial Palace, it was the Imperial family’s place to host elegant literary parties and the like. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xuemo arrived, all sorts of horse carriages and palanquins were already there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo got off the palanquin and let the court eunuchs that were by the door welcome her in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was worthy of being called the Imperial family’s gardens. Inside, everything was perfectly decorated and trimmed. The style was grand and showed creativity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s arrival was rather late. Along the way, she bumped into many distant princes, official’s daughters, and other members of nobility. Some she recognized and some she did not. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thankfully, she did not waste her time going to those parties this past month. At least she recognized some faces. </span><span style>When she met someone she recognized, she would smile and nod her head a little with perfect etiquette. </span><span style>However, when the other side saw her, they would be very cautious and stand far away from her. After nervously smiling at her, they looked as if they would run away at any moment. </span><span style>Ning Xuemo was already used to their attitude towards her and did not care. </span><span style>She leisurely strolled in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she had already been conferred a title, the Emperor naturally bestowed eight palace maids to serve as her maids. </span><span style>This time, she brought along two to help boost her reputation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, having them follow behind her was rather annoying, so she decided to let them go off on their own to have fun. Being by herself would allow her more freedom. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was a garden, then it would naturally have plenty of flowers and plants. All sorts of flowers and plants would freely grow, tilting towards the path, or swaying in neat flowerbeds. Ning Xuemo walked while admiring the scenery around her, immersing herself in the garden’s atmosphere. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the little Qilin was not as pleased. It’s ears were very sharp, and wherever Ning Xuemo passed, a tirade of gossip would follow behind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s the new Jingyuan Marquis? She is rather pretty.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who cares that she’s pretty? She’s the Lone Calamitous Star. Whoever marries her will die an early death!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Recently, His Majesty the Emperor seems to want to find a husband for her. Apparently, as long as she likes someone, then His Majesty will grant marriage…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly. That’s why my father quickly arranged a marriage for me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin had heard of these types of conversations so many times. Crouched on Ning Xuemo’s shoulders, it was infuriated and wanted to give those gossipers a good beating! </span></p>
