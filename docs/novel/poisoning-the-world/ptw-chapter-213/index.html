 <p></p>
 <p><span style>This couldn’t continue. After all, how long could one person last in a monster’s stomach?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jiu Zun was strong enough, this place was controlled by her thoughts...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She gritted her teeth as a plasma cutter appeared in her hand and she used it to break open the monster’s belly!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Jiu Zun, you better be alright. If you die here, you’re too useless!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The outer layer of the monster’s belly was finally slashed open. Ning Xuemo somewhat regretted imagining the monster to be so big. It was as large as a multi-storeyed building, so its stomach was just as monstrously huge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Ning Xuemo had found its exact position, cutting through such a thick layer of abdomen to reach the stomach required quite a bit of effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she cut open the monster’s belly, she made a dazzling sharp katana appear in her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roughly 15 minutes later, she slashed her way to its stomach which was about the size of a small room. Ning Xuemo forced herself to ignore the acrid stench that assailed her nostrils. She took a look inside. Aside from a bit of digested food, there was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo faced the bubbling stomach acid, her heart sinking. “Could he have already been digested? It shouldn’t be this quick right?! This stomach acid isn’t sulfuric acid; how could he have dissolved so quickly?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She steeled herself and was about to plunge into the liquid, when she heard a voice from behind her. “No need to search. I’m here.” It was undoubtedly the little child’s melodious voice. However, the tone felt quite lazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo slowly turned her head. She saw Jiu Zun standing not far from her. In his little hand, he was holding the plasma cutter. He was quite interested at the machine she used to cut open the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You weren’t eaten?” Ning Xuemo jumped out of the monster’s belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nonsense.” Jiu Zun replied in a leisure and frivolous way. He was completely absorbed studying the machine and didn’t lift his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I clearly saw you being swallowed!” Ning Xuemo didn’t believe that her eyes had problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What it swallowed was a boulder.” Jiu Zun started to examine the rocket launcher on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo finally understood. “You used a body switching technique earlier?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally. Does </span><i><span style>benzun</span></i><span style> have to wait for it to swallow </span><i><span style>benzun</span></i><span style>?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is my world of illusions. Shouldn’t you be completely under the control my illusions…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This world of illusions is indeed yours. However </span><i><span style>benzun</span></i><span style> is real. I have little power to change your illusions, but I’m also not so weak as to be unable to withstand a single blow. I just don’t have the power to retaliate.” Being able to see so many novelties made his mood cheerful, so he was much more talkative than usual.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘So, it was like that!’</span></i><span style> Ning Xuemo’s heart felt complicated. She lifted her head and her expression slightly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiu Zun was holding the bazooka on his frail shoulder and was aiming it at her. His little hand resting on the trigger...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘F*ck!’ </span></i><span style>She had already loaded the rocket launcher earlier. At this instant, there was one artillery shell ready to be fire...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hero, keep calm! Put that toy down.” Ning Xuemo did her utmost best to concentrate on her thoughts. She wanted to make that artillery shell disappear, but it was all for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s useless. Once you made these things materialize, it’s no longer possible to transform them again.” Jiu Zun lifted the rocket launcher upward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His body was still that of a one-year-old infant, so for him to lift such a big killing weapon was quite a comical scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ning Xuemo didn’t find it funny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful with it. Don’t accidentally trigger it!” She told him, then started to threaten him. “Don’t look at me with a relaxed face. That toy’s effect is very big, if not careful, the recoil could injure you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Jiu Zun raised his arms. </span><i><span style>Bang</span></i><span style>! The artillery shell flew off right above Ning Xuemo’s head. It directly shot into the monster behind her.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">[expand title="<strong>Teaser</strong>"]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It actually landed on the exact spot Ning Xuemo had shot earlier. The two consecutive shots carved out a hole in its body!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Can he not be this ridiculously strong? Why does this person who came from ancient times have such accurate marksmanship?!’</span></i></p>
