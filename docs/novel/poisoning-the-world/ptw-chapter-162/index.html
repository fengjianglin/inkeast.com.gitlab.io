 <p></p>
 <p><span style>And with its movement, its shape began to change. The white tiger shaped mountain grew longer and seemed to be leaning more towards the figure of an azure dragon...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her heart suddenly moved. ‘</span><i><span style>Could this be the Nine Stars Eight Trigrams Grand Formation<sup>[<a href="http://www.chinafengshui.cn/image/image12/%BA%F3%CC%EC%B0%CB%D8%D4%D3%EB%B6%FE%CA%AE%CB%C4%C9%BD%CF%F2%CD%BC.jpg" target="_blank">1</a>]</sup>?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The more she thought about it the more she felt it was true, causing her to feel shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had read about the Nine Stars Eight Trigrams Grand Formation in a book. It had the ability to confuse even ghosts and deities. If she had the correct materials, she would also be able to lay down this formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the materials needed to create this formation required stones and trees and it had to be placed on a large rotary surface. It also needed to correspond to the nine planets in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because the requirements to lay down the formations were harsh, Ning Xuemo knew about the theory but had never put it into practise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, she had not thought that she would see it here. Furthermore being set up using mountains was completely outside of her expectations!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Making the mountains in its surroundings move, this was an incredible feat. As expected, the things in this world could not be judged using common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lamented. Since she had already seen through this formation, naturally, she also knew how to break through this formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While in the water, she executed the method to break through the formation. Swimming forward a meter before retreating half a meter followed by swimming diagonally by 30cm before doing a sidelong swim for 90cm...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She constantly changed directions in the water and sure enough, the illusions did not appear...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours later, her eyes suddenly lit up. The surroundings around her had completely changed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The large lake was still that large lake and didn’t show any changes. However, the surroundings around the lake were completely different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The saint beast mountains had vanished without a trace, replaced by a tall mountain that shot straight into the clouds, like a graceful beauty towering in all four directions. The entire mountain peak was covered in ice and snow and, under the moonlight, it became a stretch of sparkling crystal clear white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And on both sides of the mountain, there were two waterfalls flowing down like white silk. It flowed majestically into the big lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From both side of the big mountain peak, smaller mountain peaks could be seen, giving off the image of a fairy sitting while being attended by two boys servants on both sides. The peak as well as the middle of the mountain was shrouded in white clouds. Covered by clouds and shrouded by mists, it appeared as ethereal as a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first impression one got was that of a tall deity above the mortal world bringing immortal children along for a stroll in the world...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo stared at the tallest mountain. The mountain was completely snow white, without any other colours staining it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She faintly felt that this mountain was somewhat familiar, as if she had seen it somewhere before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After staring at it for a long while she was suddenly enlightened. This mountain was not like a beautiful woman, but it was similar to that Ancestor!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mountain was like him wearing the large white robe while the glaciers at the top were like his long hair...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was not completely similar since the Ancestor’s hair was dark like ink while the “hair” on this mountain was snow white...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than this point, this mountain extremely resembled the Ancestor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Could it be that Ancestor found this mountain and made it in his likeness?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Snort! That’s very possible! A super swindler naturally had a super swindler way of pretending…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She had already climbed onto the shore. Green grass grew like a carpet on the shore. When she sat on it, it was like she was sitting on a soft sofa, extremely comfortable.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘So tired!’ </span></i><span style>She was really tired!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tired to the point that all the bones in her body seemed as if they wanted to fall apart. She did not dare to lie down else she might never get up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because there was no one to guard her and this place was dangerous, she did not dare to completely let down her guard and only shut her eyes to take a breather. She still focused on the movements in her surroundings...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, she seemed to have discovered something as her eyes shot open. She turned her head to look at the large lake behind her.</span></p>
