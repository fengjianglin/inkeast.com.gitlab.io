 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>This type of girl was practically a beam of light, unconsciously attracting everyone’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the area around the door was in a chaotic state, a court eunuch from inside the residence hurried out, loudly issuing a decree, “His Majesty has given a decree announcing Miss Ning to enter!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Emperor personally issued the decree; other people naturally didn’t dare to stop it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Liu heaved a sigh of relief, bowing towards Ning Xuemo. “Miss Ning, please!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo didn’t even look at the pale-faced Ji Yunyao, lifting her leg to enter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang’s injury took priority; she didn’t have the time to bicker with this shrewish princess. There’s still time later to teach her a lesson… </span></p>
 <p><span style>……......................</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo finally entered the Crown Prince’s sleeping quarters and finally saw Ji Yunhuang. Of course, she also saw all of the people who were in the room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo had recently spent a few days in the Vast Sky Empire and naturally heard of Ning Xuemo’s good-for-nothing talent and her label of being a bearer-of-bad-luck. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In his heart, there was a little bit of curiosity mixed with his disdain for her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xuemo entered, he coldly smiled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was actually this young and inexperienced little girl! </span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, due to her &nbsp;young age she didn’t understand the harsh realities of the world. She still hadn’t seen the illness but was daring enough to brag. But saying that she could heal Ji Yunhuang’s injury… </span></p>
 <p><span style>It must be that her reputation was so bad and that she was anxious to change it, so she dared to say such arrogant nonsense. Later, she would be slapping her own face! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo had naturally also heard of this Divine Doctor Mo. She had heard of him and his reputation before, but she never thought that this person would look so young. </span></p>
 <p><span style>From her intel, this Divine Doctor Mo was at least 50 years old and became famous when he was already 30. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To be able to maintain his appearances so well, it must mean that his psychokinesis wasn’t weak. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, she saw Divine Doctor Mo lift his head, looking down on her with a face filled with disdain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his expression, she knew instantly in her heart what he was thinking. The corner of her mouth curled up slightly, and she didn’t look at him anymore. Instead, she &nbsp;head directly towards Ji Yunhuang’s bedside. “Excuse me; please step aside!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Initially, Divine Doctor Mo intentionally blocked the way to Ji Yunhuang’s bed. Once he heard Ning Xuemo’s words, the veins on his forehead throbbed. This little girl wasn’t big, but her tone of voice was so wild! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you can cure His Majesty the Crown Prince’s injury?” He didn’t have any intention of getting out of the way, instead speaking with a heavy tone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right!” Ning Xuemo tersely answered, finally giving him a glance while speaking impolitely, “Since Sir can not cure him, then leave and don’t block the way!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo’s handsome face flushed slightly with anger. All these years, this was the first time someone dared to talk to him like that. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know I don’t know how to cure him?” Divine Doctor Mo rudely said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo hugged her arm, “Does this really require guessing? If you knew how to heal it, would His Highness let me come in?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo stayed silent, “...” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, she was a smart girl! Her medical skills still haven’t been seen, but her reasoning and inferring abilities gave people a whole new level of respect for her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor felt a little bit of uneasiness. He coughed a bit and said, “Ning Xuemo, don’t be so unrestrained in front of Divine Doctor Mo… Why don’t you first take a look at Huang’er…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was desperate for the cure for his son. If there was even a little bit of hope, he would grab it regardless of anything else. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo laughed, moving out of the way, icily saying, “Okay, take a look! I want to see what you, a young girl, can make out of this…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was waiting to see this girl become a joke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo walked forward a few steps to look over Ji Yunhuang… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hands and feet were swift and fast. She was extremely familiar with the treatment of that time, but it was also different from the methods of doctors from that time as well. </span></p>
