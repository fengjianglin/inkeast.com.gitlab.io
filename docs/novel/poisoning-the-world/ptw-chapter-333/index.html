 <p><em>Please note that this is a fantasy novel with an author lacking in medical knowledge.</em></p>

 <p><span style>Adding to her western style of diagnosis, it caused all of the doctors in the room to be puzzled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo also observed her. Although he still held disdain towards Ning Xuemo in his heart, he still possessed medical ethics and knew that while a medical professional was diagnosing a patient’s illness, it was a taboo to disturb that person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who knew when Ji Yunyao had followed them inside, but when she saw that everyone’s attention was focused on Ning Xuemo, the hatred within her soared to greater heights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, she watched the other doctors’ expressions, catching their amazement, contempt, puzzlement, and confusion. Seeing this, she knew that Ning Xuemo’s examination skills had a problem and she couldn’t refrain herself from sneering, “Pretending to be an expert? A trashy bearer of misfortune who can find the problem even Divine Doctor Mo can’t? Stop joking around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Two people spoke at the same time: Le Xuan Emperor and, surprisingly, Divine Doctor Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunyao was astonished seeing these two people speaking at the same time, so she shut her mouth and observed. And after some observations, she felt slight grievances and spoke, “Imperial Father…… ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just dealing with his daughter caused Le Xuan Emperor to have a headache. He told her coldly, “Do not make a din here! Your brother’s wounds are of the utmost priority!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo also emphasized in an unfeeling tone, “When the medical professional is making a diagnosis, there shouldn’t be any disturbances! Shouldn’t you know this already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunyao embarrassed herself thoroughly this time. So she bit her lips bitterly and no longer uttered a single word. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A few moments passed before Ning Xuemo stood up. She knew exactly what she should do now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ji Yunhuang’s injuries looked extremely fatal, he wouldn’t face death yet...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor couldn’t hold it in any longer and asked, “How was it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo face was expressionless as she gazed in Divine Doctor Mo’s direction asking, “What do you think, Divine Doctor Mo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo scoffed at her, “Weren’t you full of confidence and promises just now? Don’t tell me you couldn’t make a diagnosis on the illness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he was certain that Ning Xuemo didn’t notice anything particular yet as Ji Yunhuang’s injuries appeared no different from those caused by ordinary blades. All the physicians present simply thought that Ji Yunhuang merely had a wound in his heart meridian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo chuckled. She, being a natural beauty, dazzled the entire palace hall, lighting it up with her beautiful smile, “These wounds are not complicated, the Crown Prince was injured by a blade, and he was stabbed at his left ventricle…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She definitely was only able to identify that the wounds came from a blade. However, her ability to pinpoint the specific location and organ where Ji Yunhuang was injured was impressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It appeared that this young lady had remarkable medical skills…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo smirked, looking condescendingly at Ning Xuemo, “Anything else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo grinned slowly, “Also, that blade was covered with poisonous insects and right now, the venom is already flowing to his eight extra meridians and parasites are already in his heart, in his right atrium to be specific…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo was astonished, and the look on his face changed, ‘</span><i><span style>this young lady has such an acute sense of perceptions!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She was even more knowledgeable than himself and she was able to specify the details.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Could it be that someone told her beforehand?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Doctor Mo swept his glance towards the young eunuch who issued the decree. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was reporting the illness to Le Xuan Emperor, this young eunuch was also present…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo giggled, “The venom has already entered both the Ren and Du meridians……” She went on and uttered many professional medical terminologies before finally coming to a conclusion, “If we were to treat it in the conventional way, his life will be saved, but he will lose all of his martial arts and he might even be paralyzed for the rest of his life, unable to go to the toilet himself without assistance…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this statement, Divine Doctor Mo’s expression completely changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s conclusion matched what he had told Le Xuan Emperor just now.</span></p>

 <p>Occasionally, I would feel bummed because of work for various reasons. Since turning back time is not an option, I always repeat to myself not to make the same mistake next time. However, what's done is done and to uplift my mood I listen in loop to a few songs of Two Steps from Hell. I like their "Never Back Down" and "Star Sky" compositions.</p>
