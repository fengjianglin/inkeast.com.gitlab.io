 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Not a single one of them knew anything and kept avoiding its master like pest. Its master is not any less talented than them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, when I grow up later, I’ll marry you and make you the Qilin’s queen and send those humans to hell!” Little Apple spoke with extreme indignation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo bowed her head and sniffed a flower. When she heard the little qilin’s words, she let out a laugh. Then, she patted its head. “Let’s talk about it when you actually grow up.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘But a queen? This young qilin, that was exiled from its sacred land, was a little prince?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although the little qilin was more than 2,000 years old, it was the equivalent of a seven or eight year old little boy. If she were to wait for it to grow up, who knew how many times she would have reincarnated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was already autumn, the garden was mostly covered by blooming chrysanthemums, ranging from yellow, red, white, purple and even green.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Left and right, all the flowers strived brightly. They swayed gently, emitting their fragrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because in the modern times, chrysanthemums held a particular meaning, it led to the decrease of this kind of flowers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ning Xuemo had already seen many chrysanthemums, this was still the first time she saw so many species of chrysanthemums.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was enjoying the view on the side of the road when, from another direction, a person suddenly dashed out and almost bumped into her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo swiftly moved back. The person staggered before standing firmly and bowed in greetings, “Pardon me! Pardon me! This one was rude.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person was a youngster around 16 or 17 years old. His appearance was pretty and scholarly with graceful elegance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was dressed in a high quality blue scholarly garments. It was obvious he was one of those noble young masters. It was the first time that Ning Xuemo saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head. “There was no harm.” She turned around to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many thanks for your magnanimity. This one was being rude. I do not know from which family are you from? Would you allow me the honor of accompanying you for a stroll?” The youth’s clear eyes were fixed on Ning Xuemo, revealing a trace of amazement.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh! </span></i><span style>It was rare for her to come across someone who was not afraid of her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xuemo observed him with interest before asking, “Who might you be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My father is Imperial Tutor Lan. I have yet to serve as an official…” The youth smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you related to the Supreme Court High Official Lan Yufeng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s my elder brother. So, young lady has already heard of my brother. My name is Lan Liushao; courtesy name, Yayan. You can call me by my courtesy name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo nodded. “A good name.” Then, she continued to walk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Liushao stared blankly, then he steeled his heart and followed her, “May I ask for your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Yufeng was such a stern official; It was quite unexpected for him to have such an easy-going little brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was about to scare him by telling her name when, from close by, a voice could be heard, “Yayan! This young lady is the recently most talked about character; The Emperor’s newly titled Marquis, Ning Xuemo.” The crisp voice belonged to a young woman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lan Liushao was shocked and could not refrain himself from backing away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xuemo turned her head and looked in the direction of the voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was pavilion, inside which stood &nbsp;three men and four women. Their way of dressing exuded of nobility, all handsome men and pretty girls.&nbsp;</span><span style>The one who spoke was a young woman with an oval face who Ning Xuemo had once met. She should be one of the prince’s daughters, a commandery princess<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</span><span style>Beside her stood a few people that seemed familiar to her, but she recognized none of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, seven pairs of eyes looked in Ning Xuemo’s direction. They clearly were all interested in enjoying a good show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Liushao’s handsome face slightly blushed as he retreated by two steps. He greeted in panic, “It turns out to be Marquis Ning. This one has been presumptuous and lacking in manners earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He escaped in panic, running quickly to the pavilion. “Brother Huang, Brother Meng…” He then greeted the people inside one by one.</span></p>

 <p>[1]&nbsp;<span style>郡主 (Junzhu) is a term given most of the time to the daughter of a prince of first rank (qinwang). In the West, a prince's daughter don't have a title or position from being born in a prince household, except if the king or queen bestow a title to them. In ancient China, you get a title from being a direct descendant of a prince that has direct blood relationship to the current emperor. If you are a&nbsp;daughter of a prince of second rank, you will have another title. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_and_noble_ranks_of_the_Qing_dynasty#Female_members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For more informations, click here.</a>&nbsp;(The information is based on the Qing dynasty)</span></p>
