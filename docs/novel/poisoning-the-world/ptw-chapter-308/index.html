 <p></p>
 <p>The reason why they considered him a mystery wasn’t because his skill was peerless, but rather it was because he lived a simple life and won’t easily fight others. Furthermore, no matter what fights he would be in, he would never lose...</p>
 <p><span style>Since he was an art sage, he naturally wouldn’t be without money. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, his clothing was not low-key either. A random accessory on him would be worth at least ten thousand gold, and some were even worth one million gold. He was a walking treasure wherever he went. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This type of person would naturally attract the envy of all sorts of people around the Jianghu. The amount of people who schemed against him were innumerable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was also weird. This Han Shanyue was only one person, but no matter how many people were dispatched against him, they would always end up walking to their deaths…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no people who had seen his true skill, and the people who have seen it were no longer in this world… </span></p>
 <p><span style>His whereabouts were always uncertain. All five empires on the continent&nbsp;had seen him before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet nobody knew where he actually lived. It seemed as though when he should appear, he would suddenly appear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>And he would leave without a warning and suddenly disappear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before, there were some people who tried to follow him, but they would lose sight of him midway through. Some said he just disappeared into thin air, others said he rode away on a cloud. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In brief, even his live remained unknown</span></p>
 <p><span style>Further deepening the mystery surrounding his character.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo didn’t think that she would manage to chance upon such an expert during this trip to the teahouse. Some curiosity rose in her heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>So when Ji Yunhuang knew that the second floor of this teahouse had been completely bought out by Han Shanyue and they could only drink tea on the first floor, he suggested moving to another teahouse, only to be rebuffed by Ning Xuemo. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She picked a seat that was directly facing the stairs, smiling, “Your Highness, let’s just talk here then.” She waved at the waiter to bring two pots of tea. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang looked at her with a complicated expression in his eyes. The thing he wanted to discuss with her needed to be discussed in a quiet room privately, not here with a bunch of other people in a big room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t want to disobey her wishes. It was obvious at this meeting that she was very cold and indifferent to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If she was acting angrily because she felt injustice and ignored him, he would have the confidence in trying to coax her. However, she was treating him with neither coldness or warmth, and in fact was very courteous. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It gave him a baseless feeling of fear, a fear of never being able to redeem himself to her again… </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Crown Prince had come before, the waiters at this teahouse didn’t dare to slight him. The tea was the best tea, the pot was also the best pot. The refreshments were also naturally the best refreshments. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo looked at the red clay teapot. She naturally remembered that it was the one she had used last time. It should be the store’s newest one. It seems like this Crown Prince wanted to evoke the mood for remembering old friends and old times, and let her forget the things that were not as good. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Crown Prince seemed to be very diligent about this. Only she was afraid… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang seemed to be very skilled at the art of brewing tea. He personally brewed it, and his movements both flowed and was smooth. Every one of his moves was noble and aristocratic, letting people feel delighted and pleased. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Crown Prince, Ji Yunhuang was not low-key, so much of the public knew of him. This teahouse in particular was where most of the customers were of nobility and so he was even more familiar with them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ji Yunhuang had come in with Ning Xuemo, many people had stood up to greet him. Ji Yunhuang had used as little words as possible to deal with them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>These people knew that the Crown Prince didn’t want to be disturbed by others, so they did not dare go over. However, they would throw glances at the table from time to time. </span></p>
