 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A </span><i><span style>bang</span></i><span style> sounded out as her head knocked against a large stone and, after a tremble, her body stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-clothed child, “...” His long eyelashes slightly lowered as he watched Ning Xuemo, who seemed to be poisoned by her own poison and collapsed. He did not react for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That little girl’s head should have been injured from banging into the rock. Blood slowly leaked from her head. It was a dark purple colour, an obvious sign of poisoning!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little girl was still young after all. Keeping that kind of poison on her body and, after going through that kind of battle, to accidentally poison herself with her needles was highly possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His gaze landed on that pool of blood. From the colour, it seems like the poison was not mild. Would she die just like that in this place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He folded his arms and stood there watching for yet another 15 minutes. From start to end, Ning Xuemo just lay there, not even making a movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her clothing swayed in the wind, making her curled up body look even more lonesome and weak, as if a few more gusts of wind would scatter her away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-clothed ginseng boy watched for a long while before suddenly folding tree leaves into the shape of a wolf and tossing it down. It landed next to Ning Xuemo as it finished its transformation into a large and ferocious wolf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The large wolf circled Ning Xuemo and sniffed her. Suddenly, it bared its snow-white canines and bit onto her leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fresh blood spilled out, its colour also a dark purple...</span></p>
 <p><span style>That large wolf raised its head and let out a long howl. The sound echoed through the mountains yet Ning Xuemo remained unmoving.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘It seems like this little girl really did faint!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The white-clothed child moved and, in the blink of an eye, he was in front of Ning Xuemo. He flicked his finger at the wolf and it immediately turned into green leaves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lowered his head to look at Ning Xuemo. Then, he stretched out his tiny hand with the intention to flip her over to examine her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, the situation changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s body suddenly jumped up like lightning as she pounced on the white-clothed boy...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her movements were abnormally quick and had a strong explosive power behind them. The speed of her movement was comparable to that of the speed of light, causing the child to be unable to dodge in time and was tackled head on by her..</span></p>
 <p><span style>His height did not even reach a meter. Ning Xuemo was like a giant compared to him, so he simply could not endure her entire body’s weight. With a </span><i><span style>‘Bam!’</span></i><span style>, he was knocked to the ground. To make matters worse, the back of his head knocked into a limestone, the impact caused him to see stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the joints on his four limbs felt coldness, then pain, and finally numbness. Numerous silver needles had already pierced into his body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackness covered his eyes as his entire body was paralysed. He only managed to say a single sentence, “If you kill me you’ll never leave the 9th mountain…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And then, he fainted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo, “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blade in her hand was originally going to stab into his heart but his last words caused her to hold back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, she lifted her hand to her mouth and swallowed a pill. Then, she took a breather for a moment. Finally, she lowered her gaze to look at the little bastard who was firmly secured by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She cocked her head and pondered for a bit before simply taking out all the strings and threads on her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>And tied him up completely!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, the reason why she pretended to be poisoned was to lure this little fellow out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to make it look more realistic, she swallowed one of her poison pills. This type of poison would not take a person’s life, though it would cause the blood vessels in their bodies to feel slightly painful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, this poison caused the blood to turn into a darker color, as if the person had been heavily poisoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little ginseng child really was very prudent, he actually sent a wolf down here to test her!</span></p>
