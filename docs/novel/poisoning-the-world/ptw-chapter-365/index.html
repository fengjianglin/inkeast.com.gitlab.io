 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 365 - Forceful Kiss (2)</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was quite rare to come across someone who knew her identity but didn’t shy away from her out of fear. What was more, that someone possessed her idol’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo felt very happy. She sat down to put her shoes and socks back on while she chatted with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Tianlong was indeed a gentlemen. While Ning Xuemo was putting her shoes on, he automatically turned his back to her to preserve her modesty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo had only put on one shoe when she saw him act this way. She found it funny. She only had her feet exposed, was there a need to turn around?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She slightly shifted her gaze and suddenly let out a small shout as her body fell towards the lake!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Tianlong was a general and was in constant awareness of his surroundings. Thus when he heard Ning Xuemo’s voice, he immediately pounced at her, “Careful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He intended to grab her and stop her from falling into the lake. Unfortunately, due to him being tense, the momentum of his pouncing was too ferocious and with a </span><i><span style>bam</span></i><span style>, he accidentally sent Ning Xuemo tumbling into the water instead! With a shaky balance himself, he followed Ning Xuemo into the water not long after with a loud </span><i><span style>splash</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her whole face was overcasted. </span><i><span style>‘Even the way he saves people is rude and impetuous.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, she knew how to swim and would not drink a bellyful of lakewater.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was… it was already autumn and the lakewater was extremely icy. Ning Xuemo didn’t want to stay too long in the water. She very quickly emerged out of the water and thought about swimming to the shore without delay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Ning! Don’t be afraid, I will save you!” Shi Tianlong had finally emerged and spare no effort to swim towards Ning Xuemo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His swimming skill was pretty good, although it was not comparable to Ning Xuemo. It was rather heartwarming seeing him acting in such a way. Should she wait for him to be the hero saving the damsel in distress?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The distance separating him from Ning Xuemo was a bit far. It would take him about two to three minutes to reach her at the speed he was swimming. She would still be soaked in this icy water for a few more moments longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she were to swim to the shore by herself, she would miss this chance to be in very close contact with her idol look-alike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a first for Ning Xuemo to be tangled by such a dilemma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking for a moment, she decided to wait for him to come and “rescue” her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was a bit cold, she could still soak in the icy water for a few more minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pretended to struggle in the water and with her two hands waving frantically, she cried out, “Save… Save me!” She seemed like a person who couldn’t swim and was drowning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Tianlong saw her struggling; He picked up the pace!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the gurgling of the water drew nearer, Ning Xuemo expected the appearance of her idol at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pretended that she was struggling and inadvertently grabbed onto his hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hehehe! </span></i><span style>Finally, she could touch her idol’s hands. His hand was just like what she expected in her imagination - strong and hard with palms rough with calluses. Too bad it wasn’t calluses formed from using firearms like she was familiar with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She only wanted to get close to him, but forgot the most important rule when rescuing drowning people: the dread of being pulled into the water by the panic-stricken drowning person. From 10 people coming to rescue, it could turn into 9 people getting into trouble!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Tianlong clearly understood that reasoning. When he felt Ning Xuemo’s small hand, he flung it away before saying, “Miss Ning, pardon me!” He swiftly struck out towards the back of Ning Xuemo’s neck with his hand in order to knock her out and save her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s reactions had been honed into instinct. Shi Tianlong’s sudden palm chop had induced a series of reflexive actions from Ning Xuemo. She agilely swam to the side, and sent out a palm strike to counterattack and incapacitate her opponent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Tianlong’s agility in the water was not on par with Ning Xuemo and from the start, he never expected her to attack him, so his mind went blank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s fingers were aimed at his carotid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although that place was not a lethal acupoint, if it was struck, even if Shi Tianlong didn’t die, he would still be bedridden for several days!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Fortunately, Ning Xuemo promptly reacted consciously. </span><i><span style>‘F*ck!’ </span></i><span style>She didn’t want to kill her idol!</span></p>
