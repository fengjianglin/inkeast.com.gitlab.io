 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 378 -Great Loss of Face!</b></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor became speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What a great loss of face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chancellor’s son normally was used to sensual pleasures and was quite sheltered. And now, he was frightened by a little girl into losing practically all of his face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo indifferently spoke, “How can a phoenix and bird shared the same seat? Your Majesty, this subordinate does not wish to sit with this coward either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor unexpectedly stayed silent, and his men once again made arrangements for the tables for Young Master Mo and Young Master Hua to sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made Ning Xuemo look as if she held the upper hand, however, the hall was filled with young maidens who were accompanied by young men; only she did not have one as she sat alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hall was filled with men who took a glance at her body from time to time. Some sympathized with her, while others ridiculed her, and some enjoyed her misfortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo let out a sigh. She wasn’t in the mood to choose a husband, but she still felt frustrated being ostracized like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had always been an optimistic person since her previous incarnation, and the men who courted her could surround an entire city, including many friends worldwide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that her peach blossoms were extremely lush, but after coming here, she didn’t expect her love life to end up like this, with men avoiding her as if she was a great scourge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking about it, it’s all thanks to Han Shanyue!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for that bastard saying she was the bane of other’s existence, how would her days be this difficult?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked towards Han Shanyue’s direction and gave him a hateful glare. She wanted to make mincemeat of his heart!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue had been sitting there all along, his attitude somewhat careless, his wide sleeve trailing behind his back. The hall was brightly lit by candle flames, but this couldn’t reveal his true appearance. His facial traits were as vague and indistinct as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just what kind of appearance obstructing technique was he using?</span></p>
 <p><span style>People couldn’t clearly see his facial expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she saw him clearly before, her memory of him was unexpectedly fuzzy and unclear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His martial skill was actually this profound?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’d be extremely difficult for her if she wanted to seek revenge...</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, not only did Ning Xuemo have some suspicions of him, Le Xuan Emperor, Crown Prince Ye, and all of the military present had some suspicions of him, because they too were unable to see his profundity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, a single move from that great master would suffice to feel indescribable pressure, as if he was a natural saint with nobody daring to slight him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, the majority of the nobles present were all extremely elegant, going through large amounts of training, and every movement they made was filled with boundless nobility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This great master Han Shanyue actually had an honorable disposition, making people feel the urge to kneel before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if mere mortals were gazing upon a deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He obviously didn’t do anything, nor did he say anything. Le Xuan Emperor noticed him and did not dare neglect him, treating him with the utmost etiquette and respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One always needed to be mindful when speaking to Han Shanyue...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, the banquet was in chaos due to Ning Xuemo’s actions, yet it seemed like he never noticed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lazily sitting at his seat, he was playing with the jade wine cup in his hand. His eyes was drooped down low, unaware of anything happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At last, he seemed to perceive Ning Xuemo’s gaze directed at him, and he slightly leaned his head and gave her a glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The glance was emotionless. He merely looked at Ning Xuemo’s pair of bright eyes, full of burning enmity. A hint of amusement flashed past his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apparently, he had truly committed a horrid offense against her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor feeling unresigned, still wanted to assign two escorts to sit beside Ning Xuemo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever his gaze fell upon a person, the person shrank back. It was obvious that nobody wanted to take part in this troublesome matter.</span></p>
