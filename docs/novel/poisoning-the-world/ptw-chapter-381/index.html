 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue was a teenage child with a noble upbringing and as a result, he had quite a stubborn temperament. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was getting a headache from this; she didn’t want to get into this kind of pointless argument with him, “Alright, Your Highness Xijue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remove the ‘Your Highness’.” Xijue was quite the stubborn one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo clenched her teeth, “Fine, Xijue! Is this good enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, it’s good enough.” Xijue had achieved his aim. Now that he was satisfied, he downed his cup of wine. His eyes twinkled as he looked at Ning Xuemo, and he spoke with a measured pace, “No matter my identity, Xuemo, I don’t want the two of us to drift apart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His penetrating gaze caused Ning Xuemo’s scalp to feel numb, and she couldn’t help but give a nod, “Of course, we definitely won’t drift apart. I’ve always treated you as a friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damn brat, your identity is already so great, no wonder you had an aloof personality. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even while he had acted as her bodyguard, he didn’t act like the other subordinates and call her mistress, but rather addressed her as Miss Ning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might as well start calling her “Xuemo” from now on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, with his grand background, why did he risk going to the Heavenly Book Mountains without a single bodyguard back then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had also dressed like a common martial artist, making her think that he was just an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was really odd though, why did he resemble Number Two so much? She didn’t need to ask to know that they were somehow related by blood. Was it possible that Number Two was a part of the Wise King Clan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from the main branch of the Wise King Clan, there were also numerous other side branches of the family that supported the clan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is it possible that Number Two was a part of a lesser family branch?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If you looked at Xijue’s attitude, it looked like he didn’t even know about the existence of Number Two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shouldn’t Xijue be a little interested in Number Two, if he was a member of one of the branch families?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Granted, even if they lost a common member of the clan, the main branch would probably not care about it, so Xijue probably didn’t know of Number Two’s existence from the start. She pitied Number Two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuemo, what’re you thinking about?” Xijue used his chopsticks to give Xuemo a piece of fish. He knew her food preferences well since he had stayed by her side for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m thinking about Number Two…” Ning Xuemo replied absentmindedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack!” Ning Xuemo’s plate cracked as the piece of fish landed on her plate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the young qilin was quick to react and put both of his hands together and formed a barrier in order to prevent any of the soup from spilling onto Ning Xuemo’s clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo came to her senses, looking at Xijue’s expression which had mysteriously darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry, it’s my mistake.” Xijue said in an unhurried manner, though he secretly clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled a smile that wasn’t a smile at Ning Xuemo, “Xuemo, can you not think about that person in front of me?!” His voice sounded somewhat cold.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why are you blaming me for the fact that both of you look alike?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo sighed and grumbled under her breath, “Fine, I was just thinking, that’s all. I won’t mention him. Anyway, why were you all alone at Heavenly Book Mountain? You were even in such a terrible condition…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… heard some rumours about that place. I’ll tell you again later.” Xijue said softly, wanting to change the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo discovered that Xijue didn’t really talk much about himself, and that she didn’t know him very well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint smile could be seen on Xijue’s cold baby face from time to time, making it known to others that he was interested in her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo wasn’t really used to Xijue acting like this. However, it was inconvenient for her to say anything since they were in public.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was more, it’d be really embarrassing if he went away, leaving her without a companion to sit with. In the end, she gave up, knowing that she at least looked the part of a princess like this...</span></p>

 <p>Man... why Xuemo doesn't board any ship? Even if it was a failed romance and they separated in the end, just jump on some ship, because your main ship is stuck in ice.</p>
