 <p>Q8 -&nbsp;What color was Jiu Zun's apron?</p>
 <p>Answer : Silver</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The other man was greatly frightened. He didn’t care about Ning Xuemo and the little qilin who were still inside the net. He directly leapt to his senior brother. “Senior Brother!” He stretched his hand in order to support his senior brother’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s itchy! I’m itching-” In the blink of an eye, the needles caused his body to be itchy to the point that he could not take it anymore. His body was already wounded everywhere from his scratching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he saw his junior brother coming to help, he couldn’t restrain himself and grabbed his junior brother’s hand. “It’s itching me to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He strongly ordered in a brief moment of lucidity, “Junior Brother, qu-quick! Get that little brat to cough up the antidote!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Junior Brother also recovered his spirit and immediately turned to the big net, but his body became stiff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The big net that trapped Ning Xuemo and the little qilin was now already empty and the net’s pale golden strands were left sadly on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘How could it be possible?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His senior brother’s net was a special trap tool, not only it was incomparably tough and durable, it could not be cut by sharp weapon of any kind. Furthermore, the net had a special contraction that only his senior brother could unravel. Anything that was trapped inside, could only dream about escaping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, that girl could unravel the opening mechanism of that net in that short amount of time and escape!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘How was she able to do it?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin looked at them with anger from its current place while the scales on its whole body stood erect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ning Xuemo leapt onto the big stone platform in the middle of the lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her clothes were still on it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she put on her clothes, she would deal with them...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant she put her hands on her clothes, suddenly, a hand appeared out of nowhere and with lightning speed, grabbed her clothes before vanishing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a step too late and narrowly missed her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“THAT RED-CLOTHED PERVERT! Get out of here for this Big Sis!” Ning Xuemo was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hand that suddenly appeared was graceful at glance. With such delicate and exquisite hands, in this world, rare were the people who could possessed them. Furthermore, in that split instant, she saw the glimpse at a bright red sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only person that she knew who was fond of wearing such a flashy red and possessed an abnormal temper was none other than that red-clothed evildoer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young lady! Take out the antidote!” The Junior Brother lost his cool and shouted at the girl standing on the stone. Meanwhile, within his palm, a faint red light started to irradiate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo raised her head and glanced at him. She then crossed her arms and spoke with no even an ounce of respect, “You were the one who trespassed into someone’s mansion; plotted against the owner of the residence and still have the gall to ask for the antidote? Are you still dreaming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Junior Brother raged, “How brazen! Do you know who we are? Be tactful and quickly give me the antidote now! If you refuse, I’ll give you a taste of my centrifugal flame’s might!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Centrifugal flame? It’s just an application of centrifugal force!” Ning Xuemo sneered. Her sight landed on the Junior Brother’s back hand. The corner of her mouth hooked up, “One, two, three…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Junior Brother failed to understand why she suddenly started counting. But, it didn’t take long before his senior brother became delirious from the intense itchiness. The Junior Brother was no longer patient. He bluntly attacked. He lifted his hand and shot out five fireballs toward Ning Xuemo. He just wanted to incapacitate her and subdue her afterwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t expected that the little qilin opened its mouth and spouted out water arrows just as the five fireballs were flying in mid air. The water arrows collided head-on with the fireballs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Water restrained fire, thus the fireballs vanished into smoke in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Junior Brother was startled. He forgot that this qilin was a water beast type...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eight, nine, ten!” Ning Xuemo with her arms crossed had already count to ten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Junior Brother felt extremely restless because of Ning Xuemo’s count. He thought again if there were any changes. Suddenly, the back of his hand was strangely itchy. In a flash, the itchiness on his hand spread to his entire body. In a split of second, his mind was practically filled with only one thought; to scratch himself. That unbearable itchiness just made him want to scream and shout.</span></p>
