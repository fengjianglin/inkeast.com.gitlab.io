 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, she had rejoiced at the fact that she finally &nbsp;found a genuine, trustworthy, personal bodyguard. However, it seems like she was only dreaming. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about this, she could not help but feel sad. Unknowingly, she drank eight or nine cups of wine. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, today, she had nearly drowned. Even though she managed to preserve her life, &nbsp;her throat was as if it was on fire and her head felt like it was filled with cotton. Her reaction times were also slower than normal. With the added alcohol, her head was even more dizzy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today, she suddenly felt like experiencing what it is like to be drunk. Because she thought the servant girls poured the wine too slowly, she decided to take the wine jug and pour for herself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyways, today’s wine was not too strong . It was like sugar water, making her want to drink more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuemo, don’t drink anymore!” Xijue grabbed onto her wrist. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned her head and saw that Xijue’s brows had furrowed until there were three distinct creases. He appreciatively looked at her, “Do you have some matter that you’re worried about?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Worry?” She thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When did she have any worries?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo pulled her hand away and smiled, “Today’s so festive and joyful. I can’t possibly return and not be drunk. In any case, you’re still a man. Shouldn’t you drink a few cups with me? It can’t be that your alcohol tolerance is lower than mine, right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>What did she mean by saying that he could still be considered a man? </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was always an indomitable man, alright?! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue raised his brow, “Okay, I’ll drink with you! When you’re drunk, I’ll carry you home!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Happy drinking! When you’re drunk I’ll let your bodyguards carry you home.” Ning Xuemo caressed her hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue’s face darkened and he stared at her, “I had thought that you would say if I was drunk, you would carry me back to your Ning Mansion.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo laughed, “That’s not possible. My place is too small and simple. It’s not fit for an honorable prince like yourself.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuemo!” Xijue frowned and called her out, “Are you trying to divide us by identities?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha ha, no way! Here, let’s drink wine! To speak honestly, after interacting with you for so long, I still have yet to see you drink wine. Are you sure it’s okay for an adolescent like you to be drinking wine? I heard that adolescents shouldn’t drink wine. It would harm the brain…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue did not understand the modern language in the latter half of her words. However, he could understand the general meaning and his face could not help but darken more. He raised his head and used a finger to hit her head, “What nonsense are you saying? You’re younger than me!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s reaction speed was significantly slower. She could not avoid his fingers and was hit on the head by him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His hit was neither light nor hard. When it hit her head, it hurt a little. She was a person who could never accept losses, so she raised her hand to return a hit. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xijue was more sober than her and when she tried to hit him back, he gripped her wrist. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her wrist was slim and fair. In his hand, it felt exceptionally smooth. Xijue stared blankly for a second and the eyes he used to look at Ning Xuemo became slightly deeper. He opened his mouth to say something when he suddenly felt something cold on his lower back. It was as if something cold had drilled its way through his clothes and into his skin… </span></p>
 <p><span style>He jolted in surprise and subconsciously rubbed his lower back. However, he could not feel anything out of the ordinary. He turned his head around in suspicion. His four bodyguards stood as still and stoic as the Door Gods behind him. With them there, if there were people who wanted to plot against him, there would be no way it would not be caught. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?” Seeing his face had a trace of doubt on it, she asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing. Here, let’s continue to drink wine…” Xijue had not finished saying his sentence when his face changed and he quickly stood up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What now?” Ning Xuemo had already picked up her wine cup. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I need to go out for a bit.” Xijue quickly went out, his footsteps very urgent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo did not mind and &nbsp;began to pour and drink the wine. After a short while, Xijue came back and sat down by her side again. </span></p>
