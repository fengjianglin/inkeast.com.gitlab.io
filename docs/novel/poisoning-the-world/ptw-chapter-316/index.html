 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style>Ning Xuemo felt as if she went through a psychedelic dream and was still dazzled after awakening. Yet, she couldn’t remember what she dreamt about...</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head and stood up. “I’m fine. Is the painting complete?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang looked at the painting on the table; the bold, vigorous mountains and rivers covered in drizzling rain were defined by an efficient and unscrupulous brush style. Exuding of an ethereal charm, this painting was a rarely seen masterpiece. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he always felt that the painting seemed to lack something; but, he couldn’t tell what was lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo also saw the painting. The sight distracted her. She was under the impression that the painting in front of her eyes was unlike the one she just saw earlier...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She observed the ink strokes on the painting again. They seemed new and had yet to dry. It was clearly just painted recently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head. She must be very tired from being busy the past two days. Her brain must be muddled, and she was just mistaken about what she saw. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Considering that you helped </span><i><span style>benzuo</span></i><span style> grind ink, I’ll forgive you two this time.” Han Shanyue spoke. Then he slowly rolled up the painting into a scroll and handed it over to Ning Xuemo. “</span><span style>Since every painting is a gift preordained by fate, I will be giving this painting to you.</span><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Ah?’ </span></i><span style>Gifted to her?! A painting by a great master worth an astronomical price and one that was extremely hard to come by!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyes brightened, and she immediately expressed her thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang also let out a sigh and bowed, “Many thanks Great Master.” He stretched his hand to pull Ning Xuemo along. “Shall we go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Ning Xuemo raised her hand to block and evade his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sadness flitted through Ji Yunhuang’s eyes. All of a sudden, Han Shanyue faintly spoke, “Today, </span><i><span style>benzuo</span></i><span style> happens to be in a good mood. I’ll divine both of your fortunes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang’s eyes cleared. “Please speak Great Master. Later when I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As clouds meet winds, a dragon shall emerge; sever the entanglement of passion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunhuang understood the first sentence, which foretold that he would become an emperor in the future. However, to become an emperor, he had to get rid of his love? His love was going to hinder him from becoming an emperor?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘That can’t be!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His sight fell on Ning Xuemo. She could become his obstacle to becoming an emperor?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Impossible! Ning Xuemo has no power, no influence, and no connection with the other princes. How can she be an obstacle to me?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was somewhat scared of him glancing left and right at her, so she silently retreated a step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, she had a vague good impression of this crown prince, but now… She was absolutely certain that this small good opinion of him would never turn into love!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smiled at him. “Congratulations your Highness! Your efforts would someday come to fruition.” She then turned her gaze to Han Shanyue. “Great Master, what kind of fortune did you divine for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue’s voice was unhurried as he enunciated each word clearly, “Heaven destroyer,&nbsp;calamitous star; your fate is that of a lone millennium phoenix.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was speechless, “...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Fuck you!’ </span></i><span style>Was he cursing her to be a thousand-year-old spinster?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ning Xuemo didn’t understand much about those cryptic words about fate and fortune-telling jargon, she still understood the general meaning behind most of the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To say it simply, her fate suppressed all the fortune of those close to her. Whoever came close to her would meet with bad luck; they could even possibly be led to death by her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her parents, her brothers, her sisters, husband, children, etc… No one could escape from having their fortune and fate suppressed by her! No matter how many times she married, she would still end up walking on a solitary path... Alone like the autumn wind, departing with no one...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo imagined herself being old, walking alone on a desolate mountain path with the aid of a cane as the sun gradually vanished in the horizon...</span></p>
 <p><span style>These prospects were just so beautiful that she couldn’t even imagine it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is ridiculous! Not only was this body crippled from birth, it was also the bane of others’ existence?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, all the misfortunes befalling her was due to this body’s disposition?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It goes without saying that Ning Xuemo didn’t want to believe it.</span></p>
