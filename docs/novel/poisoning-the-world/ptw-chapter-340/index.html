 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It gracefully jumped down from the master seat, turning into a light emitting blue ball shimmering like a water ripple. The blue cat could no longer be seen. In its place now stood a majestic little qilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was half the size of a horse, its body covered in sparkling and translucent scales. With the sunlight reflecting off its scales, its body glinted like a clear and transparent pond. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two horns protruded from its head like dragon horns, as smooth as if they were carved from blue jade. Its beautiful eyes were shaped like an apricot kernel with a deep blue color, similar to a sparkling pure sapphire. The glint in its eyes reminded them of the lustre of ceramic glaze. The two feelers on both sides of its lips shook, adding a touch to its cuteness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its body seemed to be surrounded by a pale blue halo, rising like vapor with each of its movements and awing people with its beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although everyone heard the rumour that the blue cat was a qilin beast, it was the first time that they ever saw one in the flesh, so its abrupt appearance shocked their hearts to the core.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor couldn’t stop himself from sizing up the qilin again and again. A strange expression flit through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a ruler’s land, all belongs to him. The little qilin was found within the Vast Sky Empire’s borders, which meant it belonged to the imperial family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young qilin, do you have a name?” Le Xuan Emperor asked warmly. Stealthily, he was signaling his imperial bodyguards to go bring a few beast tamers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a name. I’m called Little Apple.” The little qilin proudly stated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor frowned, “This name is not mighty and domineering enough. How about this Emperor grants you a new name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as the little qilin allowed the Emperor to grant it a new name, it would mean accepting the imperial family’s authority over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin froze, then his eyes suddenly widened. “This name was given to me by my mother! I definitely don’t want another name!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, it had a mother?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t that mean there was more qilin beasts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they could capture other qilins, it would turn into an absolutely world shaking matter!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps they could even make the other four empires capitulate immediately!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since it’s like that, then I won’t help you change your name. Tell me Little Apple, where’s your home?” Le Xuan Emperor’s tone became more amiable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My home is in the Qilin’s Sacred Land.” In the end, the little qilin was inexperienced and didn’t know how sinister the human heart was and how twisted their minds could be. It answered each of their questions honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Qilin’s Sacred Land?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Emperor and his subjects looked at each other in dismay. It was the first time they heard about such a place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They also didn’t know how many qilins lived in that place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your clan certainly must be big.” Le Xuan Emperor was patiently guiding the qilin to get what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course! The Qilin clan is a big clan of several thousands!” The little qilin proudly exclaimed. However, a trace of sadness passed through its eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a little homesick. Although the other qilins within the clan didn’t treat it well, it was, however, its homeland after all...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, there was several thousand qilins! Everyone’s eyes shone at the news!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Apple, don’t you want to go home? If we have the opportunity, how about we help you go back home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Le Xuan Emperor didn’t dare to directly ask where the Qilin Sacred Land was, as he was afraid to draw the suspicions of this thing. Therefore, he used a roundabout way to inquire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as the qilin agreed, how could he be afraid of not finding the qilin’s sacred land as long as he followed it home?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need!” The little qilin turned back into a blue cat and nestled on the master seat with a lazy expression. “I’ll return there later with my master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was practically driven away from the sacred land. Even if he were to return, it would have to wait until he was stronger, and even better, he would be able to return back in full glory then. It didn’t want to return back in defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, everyone looked at each other in dismay. It appeared that this young qilin wasn’t that easy to set up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, everyone already understood that this young qilin only had the wisdom of an eight or nine year old child.</span></p>
