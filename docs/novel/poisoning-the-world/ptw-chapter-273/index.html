 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! That’s right! I did say that I would keep your soul so that you can inform your master and have her find me for revenge.” The red-clothed man nodded while sounding as elegant as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tilted his head curiously to look at the Eldest Senior Brother. “Are you going to tell your master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, did or didn’t that red-clothed demon want him to inform his master?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the man said, he was already an arrow at the end of its flight. If he were to mention that matter to his master, that man shouldn’t match his master’s strength...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eldest Senior Brother was at loss. Gripped with hesitation, he was unable to give a reply on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still can’t give an appropriate reply?” The red-clothed man was a little bit unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… If you let me go, if you spare my life, I swear that today’s matter will never reach my master’s ears!” The Eldest Senior Brother took the opportunity to beg for his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then wouldn’t your juniors’ death be in vain? If your master asked you about their deaths, how would you answer?” The red clothed man eyes shone intensely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I will just say that they died in… They died under the claws of the magic beasts on the Ninth Peak…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That lie is no good. The magic beasts on the Ninth Peak are indeed difficult to deal with, but they could only kill your juniors. It’s not possible for those beasts to scatter their souls. You should come up with a better lie.” The man was dissatisfied with the reasoning of the Eldest Senior Brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eldest Senior Brother had no other alternative but to reason to the utmost of his ability for a better solution, as his life was on the line. Finally, he was enlightened under the pressure of the emergency and thought about something more logical, “I… I will just say that they were killed by the Storm Sect Master!” That Storm Sect Master had always been disagreeable with people from Bright Reverence School. What’s more, he had the ability to scatter souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-clothed man laughed out loud. “Very good! You can say that.” He then fiercely pressed down his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword in the Eldest Senior Brother immediately cut into his neck artery. His eyes widened at the suddenness of his blood spurting out like crazy and his body slowly collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red clothed man lifted his hand and lightly exhaled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps, with today’s incident, the whole continent would started to have foul wind and bloody rain. In the future, it seemed like the world wouldn’t be as boring… </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man lowered his eyes to look at the guqin in his arms. He suddenly sighed then once again wiped it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…….............................</span></p>
 <p><span style>By her side, she had the little qilin, the Monarch of a Thousand Beasts. Thus, the whole journey out of the mountain went by without a hitch since all the magic beasts fled at the mere whiff of the little qilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, during the whole journey, she couldn’t spot a single magic beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She painstakingly hurried through the night and was finally able to reach the Third Peak at dawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many magic beasts on the Third Peak that were obviously weak and puny, just like the gentle magic rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the ideal place for each of the sects to send most of their disciples to train and gain experience, thus Ning Xuemo encountered many groups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, she didn’t want to come in contact with those disciples, but the little qilin was extremely eye-catching. Regardless of who they were and where she went, it caused a commotion as they loudly shouted, “A qilin! Heaven, it’s a qilin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterward, she found herself aggroing a growing crowd of people chasing behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin’s speed was much higher than the group of disciples, and he quickly put some distance between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a qilin was an extremely rare divine beast from the start. Since they saw it, how could they easily give up on it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They used all kind of techniques and treasures to chase after Little Apple, persistent like sticky gum on the bottom of a shoe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, they even called for their nearby friends and notified their others friends who were somewhere else on the mountain to come and join the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention, with the sheer number of people training on the Third Peak, Ning Xuemo barely had the time to get rid of one group before she encountered another group of people… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Not even an hour had passed, but she had already been chased by five different groups. It was like there was a trail of ants behind her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, there was people intercepting her at each intersection. Ning Xuemo knew she couldn’t continue to run away. She must face them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She patted the little qilin’s head, indicating that it should halt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin hadn’t been chased by this many people for a thousand years, so he was somewhat panicking. “Master, what do they want? I already have a master, why are they still chasing after us?”</span></p>
