 <p></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ning Xuemo wasn’t worried. Right now, it was just the two of them in this place. In this foreign environment they had to work together, so she wasn’t afraid that he would abandon her and leave on his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, this wasn’t a place that they should linger in for too long. Even if he punished her by forcing her to maintain a horse stance, it wouldn’t be for too long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She usually used the horse stance to train her lower body’s stability, so she’ll just treat this as practice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She simply shut her eyes and silently adjusted her breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she did that, she discovered that within her body a somewhat unfamiliar energy had increased quite a bit. It was circulating slowly throughout her body, bringing a comfortable sensation like a stream flowing through mountains.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This should be psychokinesis.’ </span></i><span style>She finally accumulated psychokinesis!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew that all her psychokinesis would get devoured by her dantian, so she deliberately stored her psychokinesis away from there and only let it circulate everywhere else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And then she discovered a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been in danger quite a few times and received quite a few external injuries as a result. Though she had treated them earlier, the time they were given to heal was too short. Therefore, some of these injuries still occasionally ached, while a few had re-opened...</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after this stream of psychokinesis flowed past these places, those injuries actually started healing rapidly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she couldn’t see for herself, she could feel the itchiness that came from wounds being healed. It was like she was in a game and had a rejuvenation spell casted on her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she circulated the psychokinesis for one complete cycle around her body, she opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know for how long she had maintained the horse stance, but she could feel that her legs were aching until they were almost numb, and she was unable to move them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Jiu Zun, have you had enough? Hurry up and let me go!” Ning Xuemo’s mouth could still move. In the end, she had no other choice but to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no movement behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you’re back there. This is enough, hurry up and let me go. I’ll apologise okay?” If the hard way wouldn’t work, then use the soft way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still no movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She paused for a moment, concentrating on listening. Her surroundings felt like being an ancient tomb; not a single sound could be heard. Not even his breathing could be heard...</span></p>
 <p><span style>That brat couldn’t have run off and left her by herself could he?!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Plop!’</span></i><span style> Something landed on her head. She was startled to discover that thing on top of her head was quite heavy and didn’t have any intention of moving away. Instead, it weighed her down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo thought of the various stone statues she had seen in the passageway and felt like her hairs were standing on their ends!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those stone statues were like stalagmites that could commonly be found in caves formed after long years of accumulation of dripping liquid, petrifying whatever lied within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What dripped on her head just now should be that kind of liquid...</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bit of panic surfaced in her heart, as she couldn’t help but call out a few more times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soft words, hard words, pleading for mercy, threats, she had spoken them all yet there was still no movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her surroundings stayed as it was without any sign of movement. It was as if Jiu Zun really left and stopped caring about her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She became more and more terrified. Since calling for help wouldn’t work, she would just have free herself. She started to use her psychokinesis to attack the region where her acupoints were sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was clear that Jiu Zun’s binding technique didn’t have anything to do with acupuncture points. She persisted for a long while yet didn’t manage to do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her body still couldn’t move. The rate of the liquid dropped on her head started to increase. She felt like she was wearing a steel helmet, causing her head to get heavier and heavier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A drop landed on her nose. She was terrified to discover that the liquid didn’t continue rolling downwards but instead solidified there...</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this continued, her face would be completely covered, and not long after, she would become a stone statue after suffocating to death!</span></p>
