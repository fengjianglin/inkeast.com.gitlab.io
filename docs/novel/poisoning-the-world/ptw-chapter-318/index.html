 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>She picked up the little qilin and kissed its eyes.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The little one was very cute. She kissed it again, but this time it covered its face with its two little paws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue stared silently for a moment, “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he spoke again, “Your fate is that of a Heaven destroyer calamitous star. You must avoid getting too close with other people. Otherwise, it will harm them…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo lowered her eyes as she just recalled the fate of Number Two...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It sounded like Han Shanyue’s words didn’t contain falsehoods. Everyone who had been either close or kind to her had indeed been met with misfortunes...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin couldn’t stand it anymore as it stated, “Master, you still have me. I am not a person and our fates are linked together. As long as Master is well, I can be well too.” It then dearly patted Ning Xuemo’s palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was moved and stroked the little qilin’s head in response.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘The little qilin is quite loyal!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It won’t matter even if the person isn’t human!” Han Shanyue continued to add hail to snow, “No matter who you like, you can’t be too intimate with them or you will worsen their fortune.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Fuck you!’ </span></i><span style>He kept saying things like she was the ultimate bearer of ill luck!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She may have been filled with constant bad luck recently, but her life from before had been smooth sailing until now. Back when she was in the modern era, none of her close friends were suppressed to death by her! &nbsp;So, how could he say such an exaggeration?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did this Han Shuyue have any enmity with her?! Saying all those unlucky words in front of all these people… </span></p>
 <p><span style>She shot a glance at the two assistants standing on the sides. It was clear in her mind. It won’t take long for her name to spread far and wide as a the ultimate bearer of ill luck, just like her reputation as a psychokinesis cripple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the future, no one would dare to get close to her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned her eyes and her body swayed as if she had suffered a hit, but then she sprang at Han Shanyue without warning, latched onto his neck and ferociously gave him a kiss!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If getting close to her meant that the person’s luck would worsen, then she will get very, extremely, super close to him… and pass on all of her bad luck to him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue’s body turned rigid. Because they stood very close to each other, coupled with Ning Xuemo’s lightning fast movements and Han Shanyue’s unguarded state, Ning Xuemo had successfully mounted a sneak attack against him against all odds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other two servants were dumbstruck from the scene. Their mouths were opened wide to the point a duck egg could fit in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mysterious, noble and detached-from-the-secular-world Art Sage was being kissed by a girl?! If this was known by other people, it would become the absolutely hottest gossip!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little qilin’s eyes widened into a perfect circle.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Ma-master is very valiant!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Shanyue’s face was glossy and smooth like jade. By the time Ning Xuemo came close to him, she could smell an extremely light and peculiar fragrant scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, she was thinking about taking revenge on him and only intended to give him a quick peck and then rapidly escape. However, her mind became stunned when she smelled that hidden light fragrance and couldn’t leave promptly as she had planned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you!” Han Shanyue’s face darkened as he spat out the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t see how he striked a pose, but she realized that he had already sent her flying out with a wave of his sleeve!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>CRASH! </span></i><span style>Ning Xuemo’s body crashed into the window and flew out from the second floor onto the main street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many pedestrians on the main street. They were all scared witless by the sudden sight of someone flying out of a window. As Ning Xuemo fell to the ground, she was about to squash the face of a passing youngster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Ning Xuemo’s reflexes were quick and she immediately adjusted her body in midair and landed lightly next to the youngster instead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Fuck that bastard! He really attacked!’ </span></i><span style>He even went as far as throwing her out of the window and even used a lot of strength! It caused her to be sent through the window despite herself. The sandalwood window was destroyed into pieces from the collision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her shoulders were painfully hurt, causing her face to turn pale in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted her head to look at the big hole that was once a window. She began to scheme on how she would take revenge on the person upstairs.</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter 318 is hilarious. Although, we only got the details of JZ's reaction in chapter 321. Man... his reactions make me facepalm myself. JZ is just plain anti-social and introvert. No wonder there is so much misunderstandings later on.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>When I was translating c.318, I stumbled upon a line that made me laugh.</p>
 <p><span style>“<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>放</strong><strong>肆</strong><strong>！(Fang Si)</strong></span>” 寒山月脸一沉，吐出两个字。[Translated as :&nbsp;</span><span style>“How dare you!” Han Shanyue’s face darkened as he spat out the words.]</span></p>
 <p>I found it funny because I recently watched a video about the meaning of Fang Si and now, I'm stuck associating Han Shanyue's voice with Ye Hua's voice : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmxMwaMvhVk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=57s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here for the youtube video</a>.</p>
