 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The child’s flesh felt tender like a lotus root, making her want to take a bite of it. However, she didn’t want to wound him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the knife was still pressed on his neck, he behaved appropriately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He faintly sighed. “Then release me and I’ll give you ginseng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hold on him was tight to the point that he could not even withdraw his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I release you, you will escape!” Ning Xuemo didn’t loosen her hold. “Just directly turn back like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little child, “......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gritted his teeth. “Rest assured that this Ki… I won’t run away! So, let one of my hands go and I’ll give you a 100 year old ginseng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo held a bit of suspicion. This little child was incredibly sly. Earlier, he made her eat a huge loss, thus she had no choice but to stay on guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pondered for short moment and released one of his hands, the one that was tied with a red thread. “Hurry up! If you dare to play any tricks, I’ll slice off your little head!” Ning Xuemo moved her weapon to his throat to threaten him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t have the intention of playing any tricks. His little hand lightly patted his apron, and then a rather thick ginseng appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo’s eyes brightened. She raised her hand to receive the ginseng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That ginseng must be a 100 years old as seen by its complete shape, how white and fat it was, and how even the tassels had more than several roots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo smiled to the point that her eyes narrowed. With this ginseng, she would be able to eat to her fill and won’t need to stay hungry for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It appeared that the child in her bosom was a real ginseng child. If this wasn’t the case, how would it be able to take out a ginseng just by patting its apron?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really picked up a treasure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that his apron is a hundred treasures purse?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He patted it, ginseng appeared, then what if she patted it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo belonged to the category of people labelled as doers; if they thought about something, they would immediately do it. Thus, she also patted his apron…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was… not even a shrimp appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt unresigned and straightforwardly patted everywhere: from top to bottom, she patted without watching where she was patting and accidentally patted where she shouldn’t have... </span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, the child wore a smile that wasn’t a real smile and looked at her antics; but at this moment, his expression changed while his fingertips formed a mysterious seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A white ray of light flashed in front of her eyes. Dazzled, she subconsciously closed her eyes. Suddenly, her arms became empty. She hurriedly opened her eyes, but the little child had already disappeared. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘F*ck, I still let him escape!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo jumped off the rock and hurriedly looked at the ground around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Generally, when a ginseng child tried to escape, they would use a ground escaping method, so he could have only escaped underground...</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the ground all around her was a wide expanse of abundant and fragrant of grass, even one decent hole couldn’t be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at the red thread tied on her pinky. The other side of the thread that was tied to the ginseng child, who ran off to who knows where, swayed in the wind and fluttered in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She once again tried to find the direction he escape to, but no matter how she searched, nothing came out of it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She sighed, then sat on the big rock once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Run away then!’ </span></i><span style>The truth was even if he remained in her hands, she wasn’t quite sure what she wanted to do with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, she didn’t want to bite or chew him, and carrying him around was cumbersome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, he gave her a ginseng which should be enough to keep her hunger at bay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was afraid that the ginseng child was up to mischief, so she poked the ginseng with a silver needle. She confirmed that there was no poison. This meant she could enjoy her meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, she was extremely hungry. The ginseng was as big as a little radish, but it didn’t take her much time to gobble everything up. Finally, she was able to calm her hunger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That child did not cheat her. He did give her a ginseng that seemed to be at least a hundred years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she had only just exited the water, added to the fact that the temperature was far colder at this high altitude, her entire body was icy cold to the point that she nearly couldn’t stop shivering.</span></p>
