 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> The child did not speak and just listened to her talk about her era. He did not interrupt her and was a very good listener. Only, his gaze towards her revealed a pensive look before closing his eyes slightly as a response to something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was done talking, he spoke and gave a few words of evaluation. “You don’t have a fever; it doesn’t seem like you are delirious… Your imagination is not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo “...” He clearly didn’t believe her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the modern world, stories and dramas with a transmigration plot blossomed everywhere, so everyone knew about it. On the other hand, if anyone were to really encounter someone who seriously claimed that he or she transmigrated from the ancient times, the great majority would not believe it and would treat that person as a lunatic or a mentally unstable person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If even those in her era would think like such, then for the people in this world, her story would seem like something straight out from The Arabian Nights all the more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who cares if he believed her or not, it didn’t matter to her either way. She just wanted a rubbish bin to vent out everything she had on her heart, who cared whether this ‘bin’ understood what she said or not!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted his small body and spoke casually. “Just think of it as me sleep talking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little child seemed to be in a talkative mood. “Who taught you your martial arts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo did not feel like explaining anymore so she simply gave a more reasonable explanation. After all, it was not like anyone was going to look for proof. “The Ancestor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small child was slightly stunned, then he faced her with an expression that seemed about to laugh. “Are you certain it’s him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, everyone believed so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, then how would you describe what he looks like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know him too?” Ning Xuemo glanced at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” The child answered concisely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then are you well acquainted with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little lady, I’m the one who is asking you!” The child’s face tightened, the aura around his body became unexpectedly tyrannical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surroundings’ temperature seemed as if it dropped following the burst of his aura..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was not afraid of him though as she narrowed her eyes. “Little guy, right now I’m questioning you. You’re my captive so whatever I ask you, you better answer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child’s eyes lowered slightly. “Fine, since I’m your captive I’ll answer you first. I’m acquainted with him, and our friendship is not shallow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo widened her eyes as she blurted out. “You actually know that old illuminated stick<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she blurted out the words, she felt like she had done something stupid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this child looked young, the number of years he had been cultivating should be inversely proportional so it was possible he knew the Ancestor. Did the rumours not say that the Ancestor would occasionally stroll on the Ninth mountain?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A green vein popped out from the child’s forehead. “Old illuminated stick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He faintly sounded like he was gritting his teeth. His gaze towards Ning Xuemo also turned more profound. “You really have the nerves! It’s clear that you were lying before. If he really was your teacher, would you really address him like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo had already thought on how to refute him, so she immediately started to sway him, “Little guy, you don’t understand the meaning, right? Old illuminated stick really is a title we used there. Old, meaning that he’s elderly; Illuminated stands for an enlightened immortal; As for stick… stick&nbsp;means out of the ordinary. This is an appellation for those who are genuinely a person considered to be a pillar of support. You could say that’s a title for those who could support like the white jade pillar of Heaven. Actually, a pillar is also another way to say stick. The Ancestor’s status is honorable as he’s the moral support of everyone on the continent. That’s the reason why his honorific is ‘Old Illuminated Stick’.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child looked at her, having been rendered speechless. He shut his eyes and, once again, returned to silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xuemo was somewhat depressed. “You’re not going to continue asking me what he looks like?” Weren’t all children supposed to be curious? This little kid’s curiosity was sorely lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really know what he looks like?” The child asked dully. It was obvious he wasn’t very interested.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="1"></a>[1] Chinese synonym to a charlatan, or someone faking to be a divine or mystical being. It could be literally translated as "Old Immortal Stick", but since the name was too obvious and simple to understand and won't make sense for Ning Xuemo to actually need to explain herself, we translated it as seen in chapter.</p>
