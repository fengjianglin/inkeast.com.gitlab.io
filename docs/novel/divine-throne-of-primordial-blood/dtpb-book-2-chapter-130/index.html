 <p>Chapter 130: Night Conversations (1)</p>
 <p>Nightfall arrived, and sparkling stars began to appear across the sky.</p>
 <p>The students, who were all worn out by the day’s events, once again fell into a deep sleep.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo, however, couldn’t fall asleep.</p>
 <p>She rolled around restlessly in her tent. All she could think about was how Su Chen had selflessly drawn the Jade-Eyed Cloudroam Beast away from her.</p>
 <p>A woman’s heart was very tender.</p>
 <p>She knew she couldn’t fall asleep, so she dressed herself and exited her tent.</p>
 <p>She sat down on a corner of Reflection Rock and hugged her knees to her chest, resting her chin on her knees. She gazed off into the distance, scenes involving Su Chen racing through her head.</p>
 <p>“Can’t fall asleep?” A voice suddenly spoke up</p>
 <p>It was Su Chen!</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo almost fell off the rock out of fright.</p>
 <p>A hand reached over and held Gu Qingluo firmly.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo lifted her head in shock. Su Chen’s face was very close to hers, the clear moonlight illuminating the features of his face quite clearly.</p>
 <p>Su Chen said with a gentle smile as he helped Gu Qingluo up, “Careful.”</p>
 <p>He then sat next to Gu Qingluo. “I couldn’t sleep either. Why not chat for a bit?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo’s face was thoroughly red. She twisted away from him, but she still said, “Thanks for what happened today.”</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing much. In any case, it was all fake. Even without me, that Demonic Beast wouldn’t have killed you,” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>“But you didn’t know that at the time.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, but what about afterwards? Do you feel like you owe me something now?” Su Chen asked.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo was silent.</p>
 <p>She didn’t know how to respond to his question.</p>
 <p>She truly wanted to express her gratitude, yet she continued to increase the distance between them. However, Su Chen evidently wanted to use this opportunity to bring them closer together regardless of what tactic he used.</p>
 <p>Yes, he had always been a person who would go to any length to achieve his goals. How could she have forgotten this point?</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo cursed at herself.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that Gu Qingluo wasn’t going to respond, Su Chen smiled. “Sorry, I might have been a bit too aggressive there. If what I said made you feel sad, I apologize.”</p>
 <p>“There’s no need.” Gu Qingluo hurriedly shook her head.</p>
 <p>Su Chen continued, “In reality, I just wanted to tell you that death is not always something to fear; at least, that’s how I feel...... I have already faced similar dangers many times before.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo stared in shock at Su Chen.</p>
 <p>She was reminded of what Su Chen had said during the day.</p>
 <p>After hesitating for a moment, she finally couldn’t help but ask, “You told me earlier that the girl was trying to kill you, and you also said something else about a Demonic Emperor Bloodline. What was that all about?”</p>
 <p>When Su Chen heard her question, Su Chen smiled happily.</p>
 <p>He truly felt happiness.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo’s question implied that she had finally begun to care about Su Chen again, and it also implied that the feelings she had been repressing for so long had once again sprung up.</p>
 <p>Even so, Su Chen was more than happy to allow this tiny bit of affection to blossom.</p>
 <p>He began to talk about the Zhu Clan’s origins.</p>
 <p>Even though they had both attended the Hidden Dragon Institute for so many years, Gu Qingluo never knew about many of the things that had happened to Su Chen.</p>
 <p>She didn’t know that Su Chen had become Shi Kaihuang’s disciple, didn’t know what Su Chen had been researching all these years, and didn’t know what Su Chen was trying to achieve. She didn’t dare care for him or ask; she was worried that her concern and inquiries would come to affect her and cause her to lose control, or worse, attract some negative consequences.</p>
 <p>Because of this, Gu Qingluo was stunned by Su Chen’s monologue of all that had happened to him.</p>
 <p>She would never have imagined that Su Chen was the “Cloud Bat” that had rocked the human race; she could not have imagined the pressure that Su Chen had to endure just to release Kaihuang’s Heaven; similarly, she would never have imagined that Su Chen would be able to turn the tables on his opponents even under those dire circumstances, taking care of the Six Great Clans and the Zhu Clan together...... She would never have imagined how many amazing occurrences she had missed during the years that she and Su Chen had been apart.</p>
 <p>She stared at Su Chen in a daze as he continued to recount his story.</p>
 <p>It was as if her consciousness had returned to Northface City, as if she had returned to the side of the blind yet free-spirited Su Chen who was above politics and familial ties. She felt as if she was once again standing next to Su Chen, facing all dangers, obstacles, and forces together.</p>
 <p>The days where they had stood shoulder to shoulder while fighting off enemies were the happiest days of her life.</p>
 <p>Now, as she listened to Su Chen’s tale, it was as if she was standing by his side again.</p>
 <p>Thus......</p>
 <p>Her heart became intoxicated, and her will wavered.</p>
 <p>“Just like that, I wiped her memories, and that was the end of it. Kaihuang’s Heaven sold quite well, so I earned a ton of Origin Stones and didn’t need to rely on hunting to earn money. Because of this, I haven’t had to leave the Hidden Dragon Institute these past few years. Being invisible has saved me a lot of trouble until now,” Su Chen concluded plainly.</p>
 <p>Then, he laughed, “But I guess I cannot remain motionless for too long. That’s why I made a reappearance here...... Thankfully, I made that choice, which is why we can talk to each other now.”</p>
 <p>He gazed intently at Gu Qingluo as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo didn’t dare look back at him. She said as she lowered her head, “Why would you do this? You know that we can’t be together.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen said seriously, “Do you think that everything I just said was to brag about myself? No, I just wanted you to know that the path that I chose will put me at enmity with everyone. My instructor told me that all of the Bloodline Nobility Clans under the heavens will be my enemies if I really do break through the bloodline restrictions one day. All of them!!! Do you know what that means? If I am willing to provoke every Bloodline Nobility Clan, how can I be afraid of just the Gu Clan? I have already made many enemies, so what’s one more? Perhaps I will die, but if I die pursuing the path of truth, I will have no regrets. Similarly, if I die one day while pursuing the girl that I love, I will have no regrets!”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo lowered her head and said quietly, “That’s not the same. It’s not the same.”</p>
 <p>“Why is it not the same? Just because your surname is Gu? Just because you are a remnant of the Illustrious Divine Dynasty?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo was stunned. “You know?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen gazed deeply at Gu Qingluo. “Yes, I know. The Longxi Gu Clan is actually just one of the descendants of the Illustrious Divine Dynasty. I should have realized this a long time ago; in fact, I should have realized it when you placed that drop of blood onto my forehead when you were teaching me the Snaking Mist Steps.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo said in disbelief, “What did you say? Why should you have known when I taught you the Snaking Mist Steps? Shouldn’t you have realized it after learning about the secret details of the Illustrious Divine Dynasty in the Hidden Dragon Institute and guessing that I am from the Illustrious Gu Clan?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen was surprised. “What secret details? I realized it because of your bloodline. That day, when you gave me a drop of blood, I saw that the origin of your bloodline was not a Soaring Serpent, but a dragon.”</p>
 <p>“A dragon?” Gu Qingluo was stunned.</p>
 <p>Su Chen was similarly dumbfounded by Gu Qingluo’s confusion.</p>
 <p>The two of them stared at each other before realizing something and saying simultaneously, “So you didn’t know!”</p>
