 <p>Chapter 121: Explosive Storm</p>
 <p>The Dreamrealm was filled with commotion.</p>
 <p>When the first person who saw the shocking status yelled out, “How is that possible?”, everyone’s attention was directed toward the screen and never left.</p>
 <p>Regardless of whether the Origin Qi Scholars had high or low cultivation bases, they looked like they had their hearts squeezed when they saw the simple line of words. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.</p>
 <p>“How is this possible? How can a technique for reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline appear?”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t someone prove before that a method for reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline was impossible?”</p>
 <p>“Scam! This must be a scam!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, we must expose it!”</p>
 <p>Everyone’s first reaction was actually one of disbelief and anger.</p>
 <p>However, someone yelled immediately after, “It’s Cloud Bat! The seller is Cloud Bat, the Cloud Bat that sold the perfect Blood Boiling Realm technique!”</p>
 <p>Within the world of Origin Qi Scholars, people were more willing to call the technique for reaching the Blood Boiling Realm without a bloodline the perfect Blood Boiling Realm technique. After all, that was a name closer to the truth.</p>
 <p>As the name Cloud Bat began to spread, everyone was reminded of the name that had caused quite a commotion in the human world nearly ten years ago.</p>
 <p>Cloud Bat!</p>
 <p>It was he who had sold the perfect Blood Boiling Realm technique for only a hundred Dream Droplets.</p>
 <p>And now, it was this very same person who was selling a technique for reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline!</p>
 <p>When the name Cloud Bat appeared, many people quickly realized that this wasn’t a scam!</p>
 <p>Someone had really done i!</p>
 <p>Whoa!</p>
 <p>“Awesome!”</p>
 <p>“Cloud Bat, well done!”</p>
 <p>“Praise Cloud Bat!”</p>
 <p>“Long live Cloud Bat!”</p>
 <p>Excited howls began to reverberate throughout the main hall.</p>
 <p>Countless people cried out with excitement because of this.</p>
 <p>That was gratitude, that was worship, that was reverence, that was admiration.</p>
 <p>This was the deep adoration and gratitude for the selfless contribution of a great individual.</p>
 <p>Countless numbers of the Origin Qi Scholars leapt for joy, screaming at the top of their lungs.</p>
 <p>Millions of Origin Qi Scholars dreamed of reaching higher cultivation realms without bloodlines. Now, a person had finally been able to achieve this dream.</p>
 <p>Even though it was just a single step, it demonstrated the limitless possibilities in the future.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, the gap between a technique for reaching the Blood Boiling Realm without a bloodline and a technique for reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline had only been thirteen years!</p>
 <p>Thirteen years!</p>
 <p>He had only taken thirteen years to develop a technique for charging into the Yang Opening Realm. This implied that in the coming days, there could be a method for reaching the Light Shaking Realm without a bloodline, or even the Burning Spirit Realm.</p>
 <p>The future of the human race was no longer just a dream, but a reality with unlimited possibilities!</p>
 <p>A reality that caused countless people to become excited, filled with hope and longing for the future!</p>
 <p>————————————</p>
 <p>Within the Dreamrealm, a wave of frenzied excitement was spreading.</p>
 <p>Even so, underneath the raucous celebration, there was no lack of unrest and uneasiness.</p>
 <p>Most of that came from people with bloodlines.</p>
 <p>The perfect Blood Boiling Realm technique didn’t threaten them much, and many of them had even benefitted from it. However, once the method for reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline appeared, many people suddenly felt threat</p>
 <p>With the appearance of such a technique, wouldn’t there be a technique for reaching the Light Shaking Realm without a bloodline in the future? Spirit Burning Realm? Thought Manifestation Realm? Or even the Ultimate Emperor Realm?</p>
 <p>When a myth was disproven, what was shaken was the people’s faith in the entire setup around the myth.</p>
 <p>It was like shattering a piece of glass at a single point.</p>
 <p>After the suspicion, anger, and excitement, the fourth emotion the crowd felt was fear.</p>
 <p>Amidst the waves of fluctuating emotions, it was time to test it out!</p>
 <p>They needed to verify whether it was real or not.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, the cost of verifying it wasn’t very high.</p>
 <p>Someone bought the Yang Opening Realm technique!</p>
 <p>Yes!</p>
 <p>The person quickly thumbed through it, quickly discovering the flaw in this technique.</p>
 <p>“So it’s not a complete technique; it requires the supplement of a medicine known as the Three Yangs Medicine, and there’s only a thirty percent chance of success,” someone yelled, the happiness and excitement in his voice conflicting.</p>
 <p>“Who knows what the Three Yangs Medicine is?”</p>
 <p>“Never heard of it.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve never heard of it before either.”</p>
 <p>“Me neither!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know what it is!”</p>
 <p>Countless people shook their heads.</p>
 <p>“I get it. This medicine must have been created by Cloud Bat. He relied on the combination of this breakthrough technique and this medicine to break the bloodline restrictions on the Yang Opening Realm. This is the thought process of a genius! Not only is this person incredibly talented, they’re also an outstanding alchemist!”</p>
 <p>“Since he is the one who invented it, then he will absolutely be producing this kind of medicine.”</p>
 <p>“Yes! If we find the medicine, we will find Cloud Bat!”</p>
 <p>Everyone began to yell.</p>
 <p>Everyone felt that they could use this opportunity to find Cloud Bat. As for why they wanted to find Cloud Bat, everyone subconsciously avoided thinking about it.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was gratitude?</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was prevent him from doing more?</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was to rob him?</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was to assassinate him?</p>
 <p>No one knew.</p>
 <p>Everyone had different thoughts. Some were extremely grateful, while others held nothing but hatred; some were anxious concerning the future, while others were blinded by greed.</p>
 <p>All kinds of people existed under the heavens.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, apart from the Three Yangs Medicine, the rest of the content was real. In addition to Cloud Bat’s selling of the perfect Blood Boiling Realm technique, many people realized that it was almost impossible for this to be fake.</p>
 <p>Without exception, the whole Dreamrealm was thrown into an uproar.</p>
 <p>Meng Lan didn’t need to advertise for him. It just spread by word of mouth, but that was enough to move the sales of the Yang Opening Realm technique.</p>
 <p>Within a single night, the technique for reaching the Yang Opening Realm spread like wildfire throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Every person knew about the appearance of this technique, and every person was now aware of Cloud Bat’s name.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Three Yangs Medicine appeared in medicinal halls across the continent.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t until the medicine appeared that everyone realized how slippery Cloud Bat was being.</p>
 <p>Cloud Bat had already prepared a large quantity of Three Yangs Medicine all over the continent and had already commissioned someone to carry out the sales. That way, Cloud Bat could conceal himself easily, and even the large medicinal halls didn’t know who the seller was.</p>
 <p>This also meant that the Yang Opening Realm technique should have been around for some time, but Cloud Bat had never taken it out until he had prepared everything.</p>
 <p>With the Three Yangs Medicine, the first person to reach the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline appeared.</p>
 <p>More accurately, it wasn’t just the first person; it was the first wave.</p>
 <p>Too many Origin Qi Scholars had used Kaihuang’s Heaven to charge into the Yang Opening Realm, making it very difficult to determine who exactly was the first.</p>
 <p>Signs of people successfully breaking through into the Yang Opening Realm occurred almost simultaneously all across the continent.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, these people were Cloud Bat’s fans, supporters, and staunch defenders.</p>
 <p>When the technique for reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline appeared, they were the first ones to buy it without any hesitation and try it out, using their own bodies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.</p>
 <p>The first wave of Yang Opening Realm cultivators without bloodlines appeared in plain sight just like that. They came suddenly and fiercely, appearing out of nowhere like a tornado.</p>
 <p>Everything happened so fast that it finished within the span of a couple of days, and many people didn’t even realize that something had happened when suddenly a bunch of Yang Opening Realm cultivators without bloodlines appeared out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>The whole human race was jumping for joy, almost crazy with excitement.</p>
 <p>Of course, the only ones celebrating were those without bloodlines.</p>
 <p>To the Bloodline Nobility Clans, this was without a doubt a serious blow.</p>
