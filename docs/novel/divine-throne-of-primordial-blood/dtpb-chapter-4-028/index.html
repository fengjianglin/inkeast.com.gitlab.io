 <p>Chapter 28: Stab Me</p>
 <p>“They’re in 42 Old Duck Street,” He Xu said, exhausted. They were still sitting in the dungeon.</p>
 <p>“How come you’re willing to speak now?” Zhu Xianyao asked.</p>
 <p>She hadn’t let down her guard just because He Xu was now suddenly willing to cooperate.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to die,” He Xu replied straightforwardly.</p>
 <p>“You don’t want to die? Do you think that anything you can say now will have any value? You’ve been gone for so long now that anyone who has half a brain should realize that you’ve fallen into my hands. Even if you weren’t in my hands, those assassins have already failed twice — there’s no way they would stay holed up in the same place if they don’t want to be detected. What’s the point of giving me that address now?”</p>
 <p>“Of course there’s a point. That’s an important secret rendezvous point that they didn’t tell me about. I found out about it on accident. This is the biggest secret I know. Can’t you tell if I’m lying or not? You figure it out!” He Xu yelled.</p>
 <p>He Xu was really putting on quite the performance.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao carefully inspected He Xu and found that there weren’t any strange fluctuations. She nodded and said, “He isn’t lying.”</p>
 <p>She stood up. “Inform the others to get ready to immediately depart.”</p>
 <p>“Yes ma’am!” Zhao Jingwen said before leaving.</p>
 <p>Su Chen said, “Young Miss, since this person has told us everything he knows, should we......”</p>
 <p>He made a swift chopping motion with his hand.</p>
 <p>He Xu panicked. “No, no, you promised me that you wouldn’t kill me if I told you!”</p>
 <p>“Shut your mouth!” Su Chen grabbed He Xu by the throat. It seemed as if a single word from Zhu Xianyao would be enough to end his life.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao thought for a moment, then shook her head. “Forget about it. Leave him here for now. Who knows, he might still be useful to us in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Count your lucky stars.” Su Chen grabbed He Xu by the collar and dragged him back to his cell.</p>
 <p>However, he could only sigh in his heart.</p>
 <p>If Zhu Xianyao had agreed to kill him, He Xu would have obtained his freedom. Su Chen had already given He Xu a Death Faking Medicine; as long as Zhu Xianyao gave the order, he would immediately “kill” He Xu, then dump his body. The people on the outside would come by to pick him up and He Xu would be free. He had spent quite a bit of time gathering the ingredients for this medicine these past few days to refine it.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Zhu Xianyao didn’t want to kill him, so this Death Faking Medicine had completely gone to waste.</p>
 <p>“That’s your bad luck.” He dragged He Xu towards the cell.</p>
 <p>“Then what should I do next?” He Xu was growing agitated.</p>
 <p>“Stay here for a bit. I’ll get you out of here.”</p>
 <p>“That’s what you said last time, but I’m still here!”</p>
 <p>“So you think that I’m useless? Don’t worry, I can switch with someone else.”</p>
 <p>“......That’s not what I meant,” He Xu muttered.</p>
 <p>“That’s right.” As he spoke, Su Chen shoved He Xu back into the cell.</p>
 <p>Then, he pulled out an Origin Ring. “Don’t blame me for not giving you an opportunity. This is your Origin Ring. Everything is still in there, along with a few vials of medicine I put in there. Now that you have it, whether or not you escape will depend on your own ability. But don’t do it today. You just drank the Death Faking Medicine; even if you won’t be injured, you’ll automatically fall asleep soon anyways.</p>
 <p>He Xu grabbed it, then looked at himself and said with some apprehension, “Where should I hide it?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen shrugged. “That’s your own problem.”</p>
 <p>He definitely wouldn’t be able to wear it on his finger. He Xu glanced himself over once before his gaze paused near his crotch.</p>
 <p>Su Chen smiled slightly.</p>
 <p>He Xu swallowed hard. “You thought of this beforehand, didn’t you?”</p>
 <p>“I won’t tell anyone.”</p>
 <p>He Xu rolled his eyes.</p>
 <p>He began to stuff it in his pants. When he saw Su Chen standing there, he said impatiently, “Why aren’t you leaving yet?”</p>
 <p>“I’ve never seen anyone put a ring on that thing before,” Su Chen laughed. “Of course, the other reason is that I need to delay a bit. Zhu Xianyao is currently organizing the troops up there; if I delay a bit, I’ll be able to avoid the expedition this time.”</p>
 <p>“You’re going to remain in the castle? Aren’t you going to go deal with those guys that tried to assassinate you?” He Xu was stunned.</p>
 <p>Su Chen waved his hand dismissively. “I still need to turn back into You Tianyang.”</p>
 <p>“......You really have thought everything through.” He Xu helplessly stuck his hands in his pants. His hands reemerged a moment later, and the ring was gone.</p>
 <p>Su Chen laughed. “Okay, then I’m going to leave for now.”</p>
 <p>He suddenly thought of something as he was walking up the stairs. He turned around and said, “Let me warn you about something.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t think about women.”</p>
 <p>——————————</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao took the others and left.</p>
 <p>Only a few guards remained in the mostly empty castle.</p>
 <p>Su Chen walked up the castle’s long, coiling staircase before he arrived at You Tianyang’s room.</p>
 <p>A guard was standing in front of the door.</p>
 <p>Su Chen merely shot the guard a glance and he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
 <p>Upon entering the room, Su Chen quickly drew up to You Tianyang’s bedside.</p>
 <p>“Large-Bellied Pig Dragon Bloodline......” Su Chen smiled, then pulled out a medicinal vial and placed it on You Tianyang’s wound.</p>
 <p>He gently pressed down, causing the wound to open up again. After collecting a few vials, Su Chen stopped the flow of blood again.</p>
 <p>After taking care of this, Su Chen changed You Tianyang’s clothes for him, then picked up You Tianyang and walked downstairs.</p>
 <p>Su Chen used Fata Morgana on anyone he ran into as he swaggered out of the castle. All of the experts in the castle had left. No one was aware of Su Chen’s entering or exiting.</p>
 <p>Once he came to the castle outskirts, Su Chen whistled a few times. Night Demon reappeared.</p>
 <p>She glanced at You Tianyang and asked with some confusion, “Didn’t you say it was going to be He Xu this time? How come it’s this fatty again?”</p>
 <p>“He Xu can’t get out right now, so I could only bring this guy first. Don’t lose him again.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about it. With me there, he definitely won’t be able to run away,” Night Demon said as she patted her chest confidently.</p>
 <p>“Get him to take care of Yuan Gang too.”</p>
 <p>“Got it. Any other orders?” Night Demon asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Su Chen began to take off his clothes.</p>
 <p>“Hey, what are you doing!?” Night Demon was badly startled.</p>
 <p>Su Chen ignored her. He changed into You Tianyang’s clothes, then pointed at himself. “Right here. Stab me.”</p>
 <p>Night Demon looked on blankly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about it, I’ll be fine. This kind of small wound won’t affect me,” Su Chen said.</p>
 <p>“I......” Night Demon raised her blade, hands trembling. The young, simple-minded maiden finally felt a trace of fear.</p>
 <p>“Hurry!”</p>
 <p>Pu.</p>
 <p>Night Demon stabbed down.</p>
 <p>Su Chen glanced at the small wound on his body and asked Night Demon, “Did you eat yet?”</p>
 <p>“I...... I did.”</p>
 <p>“Then can you not use a bit more strength? Who’re you trying to fool with a wound this shallow?”</p>
 <p>Night Demon stabbed again.</p>
 <p>Su Chen grunted. Fresh blood came flowing out.</p>
 <p>He sensed his body’s condition briefly before saying, “It’s still a bit shallow. Again!”</p>
 <p>Night Demon gritted her teeth and thrust out hard.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Su Chen spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>“How are you doing?” Night Demon began to panic.</p>
 <p>“Dammit...... it’s too deep,” Su Chen managed to squeeze out.</p>
 <p>“Then let me try again.” Night Demon pulled the blade and plunged it back in.</p>
 <p>Pu.</p>
 <p>Su Chen lowered his head and glanced at the blade sticking out from his body, completely silent.</p>
 <p>“Is it good enough now?” Night Demon asked carefully.</p>
 <p>“It’s...... good enough......” Su Chen waved his hand with great difficulty. “You can leave now.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Night Demon pulled out the blade. Fresh blood poured out of the wound, causing Su Chen to almost pass out.</p>
 <p>He snatched the blade from her. “That’s good enough...... Your job is done. Take him and get out of here.”</p>
 <p>He walked unsteadily back to the castle, pressing tightly on his wound.</p>
 <p>“Are you going to be fine?” Night Demon yelled from behind him.</p>
 <p>Su Chen clenched his fists.</p>
 <p>As soon as he returned to You Tianyang’s room, Su Chen arduously drank down two vials of medicine, then lay down.</p>
 <p>Lying on the bed, Su Chen muttered to himself, “Why did I think to let her do it? I should have asked He Xu instead......”</p>
 <p>His eyes rolled into the back of his head as he cleanly passed out.</p>
