 <p>Chapter 128: Successful Roping In</p>
 <p>An instant later, Su Chen handed him another blade. “Eight Doors Windbreaking Blade. It has incredibly attack speed. The blade strikes are like wind and are difficult to dodge, but it’s more useful for those who are nimble...... It doesn’t suit you.”</p>
 <p>He took it back.</p>
 <p>Gu Jintang watched as yet another treasure flashed past his eyes. He wanted to say, “It’s alright if it doesn’t suit me”, but it was already too late.</p>
 <p>Su Chen picked up a bag of darts. “Falling Leaves Darts. A very sharp concealed weapon. It can fly autonomously through the air and will automatically return when it hits a target. The body of the darts are empty and can be filled with poison. They also have a certain amount of armor penetration. Paired with the Flying Flower Hands, they might be quite lethal. Unfortunately they’re just a Grade Seven Origin Tool.”</p>
 <p>He hadn’t finished yet when Gu Jintang grabbed it and said, “It seems like this one is very suited for me!”</p>
 <p>“You like it?” Su Chen asked.</p>
 <p>Gu Jintang nodded his head repeatedly. Dammit, if he didn’t agree it was going to be taken away from him again.</p>
 <p>“Alright, this belongs to you then. Right, can you also hold onto this bag of Grade Six Jade Leaf Darts for me too? I was planning on giving those to you, but since you like that bag so much, I’ll give those darts to Qingluo.”</p>
 <p>Gu Jintang almost spat out a mouthful of blood. He could only stare at Su Chen forlornly.</p>
 <p>When Su Chen saw him like this, he laughed quietly in his heart. He had teased him enough. He patted Gu Jintang and said, “Take a look and see if there’s anything else that you like.”</p>
 <p>Anything else?</p>
 <p>Gu Jintang was so excited that he was speechless.</p>
 <p>“What? You don’t want it anymore? Then let’s go and eat.”</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>When they left the Flying Moon Pavilion, the four of them had grown quite close.</p>
 <p>They went to a wine tavern. After a few bowls of wine were drained, their relationship became even more concrete.</p>
 <p>Gu Jintang yelled with a lisp, “Good man, I think highly of you! Seventh Junior Sister’s attraction to you is no mistake. No matter what the Gu Clan does in the future, at the very least I am standing on your side!”</p>
 <p>“Then I will thank Fourth Senior Brother in advance,” Su Chen continued to pour wine for Gu Jintang, thinking to himself, “One’s in the bag now.”</p>
 <p>Getting the Gu Clan’s people to accept him was going to be extremely difficult.</p>
 <p>Relying on a single method to get them all on his side at once was basically going to be impossible.</p>
 <p>Even though there wasn’t a single efficient method, however, there were many inefficient ways to do it. For instance, he could do what he was doing now and pull them in one by one.</p>
 <p>Su Chen was already clear that marrying Gu Qingluo was going to be like moving a mountain.</p>
 <p>You couldn’t possibly move a mountain all at once, but if you kept at it like a foolish man day after day, constantly digging, you would succeed in the end.</p>
 <p>This Gu Jintang was the first shovel of dirt.</p>
 <p>Gu Jintang laughed loudly, “You don’t need to be so polite. You are straightforward and loyal; I like that about you. Right, Su Chen, you bought a bunch of Origin Tools for everyone, but why didn’t you buy any Origin Tools for yourself?</p>
 <p>Su Chen laughed and didn’t say anything. It was Cloud Leopard who laughed and said, “He just didn’t fancy any of them. Don’t think that this guy is just a person without a bloodline; he is incredibly ambitious and won’t use anything other than the best.”</p>
 <p>“Oho!” Gu Jintang was delighted. “No wonder he took a fancy to my Gu Clan’s Seventh Junior Sister. Indeed, his view is quite high. Even though the Flying Moon Pavilion is the best treasure shop here and sells the highest-quality products, the real top-tier Origin Tools are still rare. If you want those kinds of items, it’s best to go to the auction.”</p>
 <p>“Auction?” Su Chen was momentarily stunned.</p>
 <p>“Yes, the best things are always sold during the auctions. Two days from now, there’s going to be an auction, one that is pretty high profile even for the Long Coiling City. If you want the best, you’ll probably find it there.”</p>
 <p>“How can I get in?” Su Chen asked hurriedly. Auctions weren’t like shops; not anyone could just go in.</p>
 <p>“You need to be specially invited. But don’t worry, we have one. The Gu Clan’s mission here this time is to get something from the auction anyways......”</p>
 <p>——————————————</p>
 <p>Because Gu Qingluo was at the Wandering Wind Pavilion, Su Chen and the others also chose to live here.</p>
 <p>When Gu Qingluo returned and saw the four of them sitting around, laughing and joking with each other, Gu Qingluo’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p>
 <p>She took advantage of an opportunity to pull Su Chen to the side. “How did you do it? My cousin is extremely high-minded and completely ignores most people. Last time, a prince from a wealthy family tried to build a relationship with him and spent a ton of money but wasn’t able to do it.”</p>
 <p>“Get him to try spending a hundred million Origin Stones,” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>“A hundred million?” Gu Qingluo was badly startled by this number. Even though she knew that Su Chen had earned a large sum of money, Su Chen had never told her the exact amount. It was no surprise that this sum of 100 million was shocking to her.</p>
 <p>“More precisely, it was 158 million Origin Stones,” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>Su Chen had indeed given Gu Jintang a few benefits, but what had really shocked Gu Jintang was still the 100+ million that Su Chen had spent before. This 100+ million Origin Stones had totally wiped away Gu Jintang’s impression of Su Chen, which had allowed him to be bought so much more easily in the end. Otherwise, if another person tried to use a Grade Seven Origin Tool to rope Gu Jintang in, they wouldn’t have nearly as much success.</p>
 <p>The world was just this brutal. Some people could accomplish certain things while paying a very low price, while others might not be able to do it even if they had an astronomical sum.</p>
 <p>This all boiled down to the two words “social status”.</p>
 <p>In addition, paying a price was only useful when both parties were on equal levels. Otherwise, a person with lower social status paying someone with higher social status would be more likely seen as a sign of respect.</p>
 <p>Put into plain words, Gu Jintang was still Gu Jintang. His attitude hadn’t changed, but Su Chen was no longer “most people” and could no longer afford to be overlooked.</p>
 <p>Of course, this is all just a digression. In any case, Gu Jintang had been roped in by Su Chen. What happened after could be easily imagined.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo and Su Chen began to go on a number of happy dates. Every day, they were glued together as they whispered sweet nothings to each other and laughed merrily.</p>
 <p>Su Chen also got to know Gu Qingluo’s main reason for coming to Long Coiling City. Just as Gu Jintang had said, they were primarily here for the Sea of Clouds Auction.</p>
 <p>A certain medicine was going to be auctioned at this year’s Sea of Clouds Auction known as the Awakening Medicine.</p>
 <p>As its name implied, this medicine was used to awaken bloodlines.</p>
 <p>Awakening a bloodline was usually an automatic occurrence. Most people with pure bloodlines wouldn’t need the support of medicines. There were always rare cases where a person’s bloodline just wouldn’t awaken, in which case they would need the support of the Bloodline Awakening Medicine.</p>
 <p>However, this wasn’t the Awakening Medicine that Gu Qingluo and the others were pursuing.</p>
 <p>There were many different kinds of Awakening Medicines targeted towards bloodlines of different rarities. Most Awakening Medicines could only awaken the purest bloodline within a person’s body. In other words, no matter how many bloodlines you had in your body, the one that would be awakened in the end was the one that made up the most of the blood.</p>
 <p>The Awakening Medicine that Gu Qingluo and the others were bidding for was top quality and could awaken even the tracest amounts of bloodline.</p>
 <p>When he heard this, Su Chen immediately understood.</p>
 <p>“You want to activate your Primordial Beast Bloodline?”</p>
 <p>Because their blood had undergone a lot of mixture, the Longxi Gu Clan’s Primordial Beast Bloodline had become quite rare. Even in someone like Gu Qingluo, whose Primordial Beast Bloodline component was relatively great, it couldn’t compete with the Soaring Serpent Bloodline in her body. Otherwise, Gu Qingluo couldn’t possibly have the Soaring Serpent Bloodline.</p>
 <p>Under these kinds of circumstances, wanting to awaken a Primordial Beast Bloodline would require the use of this kind of top quality Awakening Medicine.</p>
