 <p>Chapter 8: Target</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo was sitting in a corner of the library near a window. She held a book in her hands and was reading it intently.</p>
 <p>Her eyebrows were slightly knitted, as if she were contemplating some problem, her attention fully fixed on it.</p>
 <p>Sunlight filtered through the window, enshrouding her in a halo of light.</p>
 <p>“Qingluo!”</p>
 <p>The quiet call was gentle, but it awakened memories of the girl who had been in his mind like a bolt of lightning.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo’s figure gently trembled.</p>
 <p>She slowly took her eyes from her book and looked at Su Chen. Their eyes met, slowing time to a halt.</p>
 <p>Su Chen stared at Gu Qingluo, unblinkingly. Gu Qingluo stared back at him. The two of them gazed into each other's eyes at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>After a long time, Gu Qingluo smiled gently. “You came.”</p>
 <p>This simple greeting caused waves of complex emotions to wash over Su Chen. However, his expression didn’t change. “Mhm. So did you.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo put down her book. “I’m considered part of the Longxi Region, so I participated in the exam there.”</p>
 <p>“So you hurriedly left Northface because of the region’s exam?” Su Chen asked, as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>He acted as though Gu Qingluo’s departure had just been like a fleeting wisp of smoke to him.</p>
 <p>Youths were by nature impetuous. Even if he saw the person he loved, he would probably continue to stubbornly hold to his honor.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Gu Qingluo lowered her head and replied gently. “Unfortunately, I was in a hurry, so I didn’t have time to tell you. Sorry.”</p>
 <p>Anger surged in Su Chen’s heart. “I didn’t know you were in such a hurry for your exam.”</p>
 <p>The other people in the library, hearing their conversation, glared at them impatiently and some even sent some angered shushes.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo let out a sigh and put her book down. She understood she wasn’t going to finish it today.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo returned the book, then said, “I’d like to go take a walk. Would you like to come with me?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen remained silent. He followed behind Gu Qingluo as they left the library.</p>
 <p>They walked along a path, trees on either side. With a gentle voice, Gu Qingluo said, “Last time, I left in a hurry and didn’t tell you anything. I shouldn’t have done that, so I’ll apologize for that.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen only felt agony. “You know that’s not what I want to hear.”</p>
 <p>“Do you want to know why I left just like that?” Gu Qingluo gently smiled. She paused for a moment, then continued, “Because it’s impossible for us to be together.”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“You already know the answer. You’re just not willing to admit it.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen felt a pain in his heart. “Because of my family background?”</p>
 <p>A beautiful, radiant smile burst forth from Gu Qingluo. “See, you know full well why we can’t be together. You should understand the differences between Bloodline Nobility Clans and non-bloodline clans without me explaining it to you, right?”</p>
 <p>Of course Su Chen understood!</p>
 <p>He understood ever since the Three Mountain Region exam.</p>
 <p>The difference between Bloodline Nobility Clans and non-bloodline clans was just like the difference between Su Chen and the servants in his clan.</p>
 <p>This gap had been formed over a few thousand years by Bloodline Nobility Clans. It was not affected by individual preference.</p>
 <p>In order to preserve the purity of their bloodline, Bloodline Nobility Clans only married other Bloodline Nobility Clans.</p>
 <p>Every now and then there was a marriage between someone with and someone without a bloodline. But it very rarely happened, and it was even rarer for it to be successful. These marriages were looked down upon by Bloodline Nobility Clans.</p>
 <p>The love between Su Chen and Gu Qingluo was already against the status quo. It did not agree with the social divisions. This was why Gu Qingluo turned him down.</p>
 <p>In fact, she hadn’t even done so to his face, instead choosing to just leave.</p>
 <p>Su Chen had fantasized about it before. He dreamt that love could surpass social status and rank. He dreamt that Gu Qingluo had left for another reason, not because of such a realistic factor. But when he met Gu Qingluo again, when he heard her explain it, an unexplainable, a searing pain ripped through his heart.</p>
 <p>Was the truth really so simple?</p>
 <p>Was this really the truth?</p>
 <p>In the end, the two of them never even went on a date, so how could he ask her to give up everything she had for him?</p>
 <p>Su Chen knew he couldn’t blame Gu Qingluo. But this didn’t ease the pain in his heart the slightest.</p>
 <p>Su Chen forcefully resisted the pain in his heart, gently smiling on the outside. “Of course I understand. It was just my wishful thinking, going for someone way out of my league. For a woman like you, it’s already good enough just to have you as a friend, yet I wanted more. I really am......”</p>
 <p>Su Chen scratched his head. “But if you weren’t willing, why didn’t you just say something to me? You didn’t even leave me a message, nor did you tell me you enrolled in the Hidden Dragon Institute. Were you worried that I wouldn’t give up on you? That I would chase you, giving you trouble every step of the way?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo lowered her head. “It’s my fault. I’m so sorry.”</p>
 <p>“It’s okay. I can understand. Don’t worry, since you turned me down, I won’t bother you about it anymore.” Su Chen laughed. “Can we still be friends?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo nodded. “Of course we can.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen tilted his head back and laughed freely, then said, “Right, what place did you get in your region’s competition?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo shook her head. “I didn’t do as well as you did. I only got twelfth place.”</p>
 <p>“Twelfth? What a pity, you were so close to the top 10. But the Gu Clan’s Bloodline is still incredibly strong, and you are very talented. You’ll definitely get a lot stronger.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you.”</p>
 <p>The two of them walked and talked, but their tones became polite and estranged.</p>
 <p>After conversing for a bit more, Su Chen said, “Oh my goodness, I just remembered I have something else to take care of. I’ll take my leave first. I’m so happy to have seen you today! Let’s stay in touch?”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Gu Qingluo gently replied.</p>
 <p>The two of them said their goodbyes.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo watched his departing figure. Tears began to roll down her cheeks as she softly whispered, “I’m so sorry, Su Chen. I don’t want you to die......”</p>
 <p>After leaving Gu Qingluo behind, Su Chen furiously walked towards the nearby forest.</p>
 <p>He walked rapidly, as if there were something chasing him from behind.</p>
 <p>His steps got faster and faster and before long he was running at top speed.</p>
 <p>He sprinted through the forest, ignoring everything in front of him and knocking down many trees as he ran until he had no energy left. He leaned against a boulder and began to bawl.</p>
 <p>Tears streamed down his face as he howled in anguish, throwing away any semblance of composure.</p>
 <p>All of the strength he had been trying to muster instantly shattered. All that remained was pain that pierced through his entire body, as if a needle had penetrated his heart.</p>
 <p>Su Chen released all of the weakness and vulnerability in his heart.</p>
 <p>After an unknown period of time, all sorrow left his being. The usual calm and collected Su Chen began to resurface.</p>
 <p>He wiped his cheeks dry and stood up.</p>
 <p>Su Chen took in a deep breath, reorganized his robes, then muttered to himself, “Alright, you’ve finished crying and being soft. It’s time to sober up.”</p>
 <p>“Before, my only goal was to become stronger, but I didn’t know why I needed to get stronger.”</p>
 <p>“Now, now I understand.”</p>
 <p>“I understand the path I will walk!”</p>
 <p>“What bullshit bloodlines? It’s just a bunch of mutated beast-humans anyways! The human race’s enemy is the wanton, savage Beast Race. If we rely on bloodlines as the source of our strength, we will never surpass the Beast Race!”</p>
 <p>“I will surpass this bloodline system and create humankind’s own cultivation method. In the future, humankind will not rely on bloodlines to cultivate. I will make humankind rise to prominence once more!”</p>
 <p>“I will build a throne for mankind that surpasses any bloodline!”</p>
 <p>Su Chen impassionedly declared what was to be the pursuit of his entire life.</p>
 <p>After these words left his mouth, the voice of an old man entered his ears. “Nonsense! The ravings of a lunatic!”</p>
