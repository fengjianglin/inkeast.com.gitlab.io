 <p>Chapter 54: Dreamrealm Privilege</p>
 <p>Su Chen conversed with Cloud Leopard for a bit longer before returning to the tent and going to bed.</p>
 <p>He said that he was going to rest, but in reality he was going to enter the Dreamrealm to cultivate.</p>
 <p>This had already become Su Chen’s habit every night.</p>
 <p>The pattern on the back of his hand slowly swirled, bringing Su Chen’s consciousness into the Dreamrealm.</p>
 <p>Su Chen reappeared within the Dreamrealm Castle’s Hall of Knowledge. This was precisely where he had gone “offline” last time.</p>
 <p>He entered the room to the side and began searching for the notice that he had sent out concerning Kaihuang’s Heaven, but he discovered that he couldn’t find it.</p>
 <p>What’s going on?</p>
 <p>He had broadcasted Kaihuang’s Heaven last night and then went to cultivate his Origin Skills.</p>
 <p>He originally thought that he would’ve already sold at least a few no matter what, but he discovered today that his notice had disappeared without a trace. The transaction record indicated that only one person had bought his Origin Skill.</p>
 <p>What the hell is happening?</p>
 <p>Just as he was trying to process what was happening, his vision blurred. Dream Spirit Lulu suddenly appeared before him.</p>
 <p>The Dream Spirit let out a pleasant laugh as she fluttered in the air. “You’re finally here! I’ve been waiting all day for you.”</p>
 <p>“Why did the notice I sent out yesterday disappear?” Su Chen asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s precisely what I wanted to talk to you about. Were you the one that invented that method to reach the Blood Boiling Realm without a bloodline?”</p>
 <p>“That’s none of your business. I just want to know why it disappeared.” Su Chen asked, his tone unhappy.</p>
 <p>The Dream Spirit flew in a circle. “Do you even need to ask? Naturally, someone covered it up, preventing it from being broadcast.”</p>
 <p>“Covered it up?” Su Chen’s gaze turned frosty.</p>
 <p>So someone had indeed been messing around behind the scenes.</p>
 <p>In fact, when he had initially decided to broadcast Kaihuang’s Heaven within the Dreamrealm, Su Chen had already intuitively guessed that matters would not proceed straightforwardly, but he never expected that the other party would act so quickly. He had just sent it out when someone directly covered it up.</p>
 <p>“Why is it that the content I sent out can be covered up by others?” Su Chen asked despite this.</p>
 <p>“You didn’t ask who covered it up or why they did it. Very good, that means that you were already prepared for this outcome a long time,” Lulu laughed as she flapped her wings.</p>
 <p>“Answer my question!” Su Chen said, his anger mounting.</p>
 <p>“Of course it’s because of privilege!” Lulu replied. “Just like within the real world, the powerful also rule over the weak here. Within the Dreamrealm, those with higher-tier privileges also have special rights over others. They can send and read any notices they wish, and they can even cover up certain notices. Evidently, some big figure didn’t like what you broadcasted, so he or she chose to cover it up.”</p>
 <p>“You even give people this kind of authority?”</p>
 <p>“Naturally. Raising your privilege within the Dreamrealm costs many many Dream Droplets.” Lulu continued to circle in the air. “Without these benefits, who would be willing to raise their Dreamrealm Privilege?”</p>
 <p>“The Lord of the Dreamrealm really does know how to make money,” Su Chen angrily harrumphed.</p>
 <p>“He’s just trying to make a living,” Lulu giggled.</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>After talking with Lulu, Su Chen discovered that there were three main tiers of privilege within the Dreamrealm: low-tier Dream Guests, mid-tier Dream Officers, and high-tier Dream Monarchs. Every tier had their own varying levels of privilege and levels. Reaching higher levels would require a lot of time, money, and consciousness power.</p>
 <p>Someone like Su Chen was considered a level one low-tier Dream Guest. He didn’t have many special privileges, so others could exert their special privileges over him.</p>
 <p>Only high-tier Dream Monarchs had the privilege to cover up broadcasts.</p>
 <p>The information Su Chen had attempted to broadcast had been covered up by a high-tier Dream Monarch.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, then as long as there’s a Dream Emperor present, I will never be able to broadcast a notice that I want to broadcast?” Su Chen said disappointedly.</p>
 <p>“That might not be true.” The Dream Spirit flapped her wings in midair as she said, “I’ll tell you a little secret. Dream Monarchs can cover up your broadcast, but they cannot delete it. It also costs Dream Droplets to cover up someone’s notice.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s eyes lit up. “You’re saying that it costs them a certain amount every day?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right! In addition, concealing the notices of different tiers costs different amounts. If you don’t want your own notices to be concealed in the future, you can choose to increase your privilege. The higher your privilege tier, the more your opponents will need to pay to conceal them. If you become a high-tier Dream Monarch, your opponents won’t be able to conceal them anymore!”</p>
 <p>“Of course, you will be able to earn more money as well.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen instantly understood.</p>
 <p>What kind of secret was this? This was just another tactic the Lord of the Dreamrealm could use to earn more money.</p>
 <p>In order to prevent certain notices from ever seeing the light of day, those with higher-tier privileges would need to constantly hand over Dream Droplets to the Lord of the Dreamrealm. That was quite a good idea.</p>
 <p>The biggest “problem” with the Dreamrealm was that no physical transactions could take place; only information could be transmitted here.</p>
 <p>Under these kinds of circumstances, figuring out how to increase the value of the Dreamrealm was something that the Lord of the Dreamrealm had spent quite a bit of energy thinking about.</p>
 <p>Creating different tiers of privilege was the method that the Lord of the Dreamrealm had devised.</p>
 <p>“That’s right!” the Dream Spirit replied. “Thus, you should probably raise your privilege level if you don’t want someone to cover your notices”</p>
 <p>“I’m not interested in being used by you.” Su Chen shook his head, preparing to leave the Dreamrealm.</p>
 <p>“You’d best accept my advice,” the Dream Spirit laughed. “I’ll tell you another secret.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?” Su Chen suddenly felt a trace of unsettlement seep into his heart.</p>
 <p>“The high-tier Dream Monarch that covered up your notice is currently trying to determine your true identity. If you don’t want to be discovered by him, you’d best increase your privilege tier quickly!”</p>
