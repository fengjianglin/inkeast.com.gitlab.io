 <p>Chapter 46: Illusion Crystal</p>
 <p>After a long time, Zhu Xianyao was the first to speak. “Su Chen, it’s you, right?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen didn’t reply. He glanced at He Xu.</p>
 <p>He Xu gestured helplessly. “I didn’t do it on purpose.”</p>
 <p>These words were equivalent to a confession.</p>
 <p>Su Chen sighed gently.</p>
 <p>There was no point in continuing to pretend at this point.</p>
 <p>Su Chen didn’t say any more. His appearance gradually began to morph until he reverted to his original appearance.</p>
 <p>When she saw the familiar face appear in front of her, Zhu Xianyao was completely enraged.</p>
 <p>“It’s really you! It’s really you!”</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Heavenly Fox Finger.</p>
 <p>She went straight for the jugular, starting out with a killing blow almost immediately.</p>
 <p>Su Chen, however, was not surprised. He disappeared and reappeared behind Zhu Xianyao, giving He Xu a shove and pushing him into Zhu Xianyao to block her. He sighed, “What’s the point of doing this? What benefit does knowing these things give you?”</p>
 <p>“It’s better than being toyed wtih by you like I’m some kind of circus monkey!” Zhu Xianyao shoved He Xu aside as she charged at Su Chen.</p>
 <p>Su Chen dodged to the side, continuing to stand behind He Xu. “I never toyed around with you. Running into you this time was just a coincidence. My goal was just to save someone and carry out our plan.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t care. You lied to me!” Zhu Xianyao kicked out furiously.</p>
 <p>Su Chen hurriedly dodged. This kick slammed into He Xu instead.</p>
 <p>“AH!” He Xu yelled in pain.</p>
 <p>Su Chen continued to orbit around He Xu so that he was always between Su Chen and Zhu Xianyao. “I already promised to give you your memories back. What’s the point of acting like this?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t play this game with me! You said you would help me recover the truth, not my memories. You’re definitely going to lie to me again!” Zhu Xianyao unleashed another kick, this one aimed at He Xu’s head.</p>
 <p>Oh, so now she was clearheaded and could tell the difference between the truth and recovering her memories.</p>
 <p>Su Chen slipped by underneath He Xu. “I promise that I’ll tell you the truth.”</p>
 <p>“Taking things out of context can also be the truth, as is trapping me with misleading statements or answering selectively!” Zhu Xianyao continued to unleash flying kick after flying kick, flailing her legs around everywhere.</p>
 <p>Her intelligence seemed to have suddenly risen.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Su Chen could use Whitetower Teleportation again. He directly reappeared behind He Xu and grabbed him, then retreated.</p>
 <p>He Xu yelled anxiously, “Why do you keep hiding behind me!”</p>
 <p>Su Chen said, “This place is completely empty. There’s no cover apart from you here. Also, you revealed my identity, so you need to be taught a lesson.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao unleashed another palm strike.</p>
 <p>Su Chen grabbed He Xu and continued to retreat. “If you want to interpret it that way, then there’s nothing I can do. But first I want to tell you something.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not going to listen to you!” Zhu Xianyao replied.</p>
 <p>She was just about to attack again when she suddenly felt a wave of dizziness come over her as all the energy seemed to drain from her body. She swayed and actually collapsed onto the ground.</p>
 <p>What was going on?</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was stunned.</p>
 <p>Su Chen walked over. “Don’t be anxious. You just used the medicine to recover earlier. Even though this kind of medicine can help you quickly recover, it also expends a large amount of physical strength. You shouldn’t make too many moves after taking this medicine since your body needs time to process it. Since you forced things a little bit, you just exhausted the last remaining bit of physical strength in your body. Don’t worry; you’ll be fine after a quick nap......”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao didn’t hear the rest as the waves of dizziness overcame her. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head as she fainted.</p>
 <p>“Whew! Scared me half to death.” He Xu sat down on the ground, totally drained. Su Chen stared at him coolly.</p>
 <p>He said, “You wasted quite a bit more time, so you’d better pray that your movements are a little faster.”</p>
 <p>He Xu was badly startled. He no longer sat down to rest and began furiously excavating the precious stones.</p>
 <p>At this point in time, he could also sense the void here becoming unstable and was going to collapse soon.</p>
 <p>In other words, it was going to be impossible to excavate all of the precious stones in here.</p>
 <p>He Xu felt a wave of grief wash over him.</p>
 <p>What a pity!</p>
 <p>Su Chen, however, ignored him completely. He picked up Sark and Zhu Xianyao and walked out through the tunnel.</p>
 <p>Outside of the tunnel stood Yue Longsha.</p>
 <p>When she saw Su Chen appear, Yue Longsha smiled slightly. “It seems like your troubles have only just begun.”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps this is fate. No matter how hard you try, it’s impossible to avoid any mishaps,” Su Chen laughed.</p>
 <p>“So what are you planning on doing next?” Yue Longsha asked.</p>
 <p>Su Chen thought for a moment, then said, “Since she wants the truth, then let’s give her the truth. But you should be the one to tell her. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“Me?” Yue Longsha pointed at herself, shocked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, you!” Su Chen said with conviction. “I think that this might be the best way to get her to accept the situation. Right now, she has a certain bias against me. She won’t believe me no matter what I say. As for you, she might at the very least be able to tell that you aren’t lying.”</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha hugged her arms. “So how will you repay me?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen smiled bitterly. “I owe you another one, okay?”</p>
 <p>“Not okay!” Yue Longsha arched her eyebrows.</p>
 <p>“We’re friends, aren’t we......”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha waggled her finger. “Just because we’re friends doesn’t mean that I’ll do anything for you for free.”</p>
 <p>“Then what do you want?” Su Chen asked.</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha thought for a moment. “Since I’ve helped you so much, I should have a share of the spoils, right?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen was stunned.</p>
 <p>The last time he had proposed this to Yue Longsha, he had made her unhappy.</p>
 <p>This time, when he brought up their friendship, Yue Longsha started to negotiate benefits with him.</p>
 <p>What was going on?</p>
 <p>He stared at Yue Longsha, a bit confused. Yue Longsha, however, reached out her hand and said, “Let’s do this. However, let me say first of all that I won’t accept anything that isn’t worth anything.”</p>
 <p>“This......” Su Chen hesitated for a moment. He glanced at what he had, only to find that there was nothing he had that really suited her.</p>
 <p>He watched as Yue Longsha pried a rainbow-colored stone from his hand.</p>
 <p>It was the Illusion Crystal that Su Chen had just pried off of the tunnel wall.</p>
 <p>The Illusion Crystal wasn’t any particularly valuable stone. It had no cultivation uses and its supply was not that rare, so its price was relatively low. Because it was relatively durable, commoners often used it as a symbol of eternal love. The Illusion Crystal Su Chen had found was relatively rare and was multicolored. It had a moon-like imprint and two human-like figures, making it quite a unique treasure. This was why Su Chen had pried it off, as he was planning on giving it to Gu Qingluo.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, Yue Longsha had set her sights on it.</p>
 <p>A happy expression flashed across her face as she took the rainbow Illusion Crystal from Su Chen’s hands. “It’s very pretty. Let’s treat this as repayment for what I’ve done for you.”</p>
 <p>“You......” Su Chen stared at her, dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>“What? You aren’t willing to part with it?” Yue Longsha asked.</p>
 <p>Su Chen shook his head. “Of course I am. Since you like it, then you can have it.”</p>
 <p>“It would be impolite of me to refuse,” Yue Longsha said as she picked up Zhu Xianyao and walked away.</p>
 <p>She wanted to leave first.</p>
 <p>Su Chen watched her as she disappeared, remaining silent for quite some time.</p>
 <p>Eventually, cracks began to appear everywhere.</p>
 <p>This meant that the entire physical illusion realm was about to collapse.</p>
 <p>Within the tunnel, He Xu also unwillingly headed for the exit as he pried off a few final stones......</p>
