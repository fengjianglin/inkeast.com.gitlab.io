 <p>Chapter 59: Surprise Attack</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was incredibly happy as they walked down the busy street.</p>
 <p>The current her was like an innocent little girl. Even though this woman could be quite scary when she was enraged, you still couldn’t help but take a few extra glances at her. There were even a few masochists who would willingly allow her to step all over them.</p>
 <p>Because of this, Su Chen, as the man by Zhu Xianyao’s side, was subjected to countless infuriated gazes.</p>
 <p>When faced with this kind of circumstance, with Zhu Xianyao was still going on her merry way, Su Chen could only shake his head helplessly.</p>
 <p>He had a feeling that if this were to continue, something was bound to happen sooner or later.</p>
 <p>He could only jinx himself with the bad omens.</p>
 <p>And indeed, it happened extremely quickly.</p>
 <p>A group of people stepped out in front of them, forcing the two to stop in place.</p>
 <p>A dandy popped out of nowhere and leered at Zhu Xianyao as he said to Su Chen, “Here, a thousand taels of pure gold for this broad.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen turned around to glance at Zhu Xianyao, who was standing there hugging her arms while grinning at him.</p>
 <p>Under normal circumstances, Zhu Xianyao would have been infuriated; however, this time she wasn’t angry. Obviously, she wanted to see what Su Chen’s reaction was going to be.</p>
 <p>Su Chen shrugged and said in a low voice to the dandy, “Don’t blame me for not letting you know. This woman you’re trying to buy is a Yang Opening Realm cultivator. Are you sure you can get her with just a thousand taels of pure gold?”</p>
 <p>Yang Opening Realm cultivator?</p>
 <p>That dandy was obviously given quite a bad fright. Buying a Yang Opening Realm cultivator with the equivalent of a thousand Origin Stones? No matter how much of a silk pants he acted like, even he knew that he was basically asking to get killed. He was scared so badly that he couldn’t even think of a response, only able to scurry away with his group, their tail between their legs.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao pouted. “That’s how you’re planning on dealing with that situation?”</p>
 <p>“What else did you think I was going to do? First act like I was afraid, bait him into attacking me, then teach him a lesson he’ll never forget or perhaps even kill them all?” Su Chen countered.</p>
 <p>After thinking for a moment, he said, “Yes, as a woman, perhaps you just like to watch men fight over you. That’s exactly what you want, right?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao replied, “I just wanted to see how deep your feelings for me are.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to see anything. You knew from the beginning.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao froze.</p>
 <p>Yes, she had known from the very beginning. But why did she seem to be unable to resist the urge to try to get Su Chen to play his hand?</p>
 <p>It was because she loved him, and because she still hoped that he would see her the same way she saw him.</p>
 <p>Yes, she hoped that Su Chen would make a huge scene on her behalf and teach those brats a lesson until they pissed their pants in terror. It wasn’t so that she could feel absolutely in control, but rather that of being protected by someone.</p>
 <p>Of course she didn’t need to be protected.</p>
 <p>But she still wanted Su Chen to protect her.</p>
 <p>Even if that protection was totally unnecessary.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for her, Su Chen wouldn’t give it to her.</p>
 <p>He had used the simplest and most effective way of resolving the issue. There was no climax or stimulation. All Zhu Xianyao felt was disappointment.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was sad and hurt because of this, but she also wasn’t willing to just leave. She could only stare at Su Chen resentfully.</p>
 <p>When he saw her like this, Su Chen sighed. “You like watching me fight for you? Fine, watch this.”</p>
 <p>What?</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was stunned.</p>
 <p>She watched as Su Chen drew his blade.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Mountain Beheading Blade surged through the air, destroying the nearby wall. A tragic cry rang out through the air.</p>
 <p>Blood flew through the air.</p>
 <p>A bisected Sand Race corpse toppled to the ground.</p>
 <p>This is…...</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was stunned.</p>
 <p>“He’s discovered us!” A sudden commotion could be heard.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the old man selling cold-brewed tea, the man selling Camel Beasts, the porter carrying a shoulder pole, the fortune teller, the servants in the store, and the passerby on the streets all began to charge at Su Chen.</p>
 <p>Hordes of individuals charged out of the nearby shops as well. The formerly open street had suddenly become crowded with tens if not hundreds of people.</p>
 <p>The Sand Race!</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao immediately understood. The Sand Race was here to get their revenge!</p>
 <p>After Pall had fallen, there were still a few people loyal to him even though most of the Sand Race officials were currently locked in an internal conflict with one another.</p>
 <p>They had chased Su Chen all the way here and had been looking for opportunities this whole time.</p>
 <p>Now was their opportunity!</p>
 <p>Su Chen and Zhu Xianyao had come out by themselves, while there were more than a hundred Sand Race individuals who had come here to get revenge.</p>
 <p>The most shocking part of it all was that they had two Light Shaking Realm cultivators with them!</p>
 <p>Two!</p>
 <p>When the two Light Shaking Realm cultivators appeared before Zhu Xianyao and Su Chen, the vigorous aura emanating from the two Light Shaking Realm cultivators gave them quite a bad shock.</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s current strength was sufficient to fight against a single Light Shaking Realm cultivator, but not two at once, not to mention the hordes of helpers they had brought along.</p>
 <p>More shockingly, the instant they appeared, they used their immense reserves of Origin Energy to lock down the surroundings, making it impossible for Su Chen to use the Flood Dragon Emperor Shuttle to escape.</p>
 <p>“Kill them!”</p>
 <p>The Light Shaking Realm cultivator in the lead pointed at Su Chen as he barked.</p>
 <p>“Hurry, let’s get out of here!” Su Chen turned around and barked at Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>He grabbed Zhu Xianyao’s hand and tossed her behind him.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao didn’t have enough time to react. In the blink of an eye, she had flown almost a hundred feet. As she flew through the air, she watched as Su Chen faced off against ten Sand Race individuals that were charging towards him.</p>
 <p>“No!” Zhu Xianyao screamed.</p>
 <p>Every woman dreamed of having a man who would risk their life to protect them and fight for them.</p>
 <p>When that day came, however, she discovered that what she felt wasn’t gratification but pain.</p>
 <p>Yes, Su Chen had finally thrown everything away to protect her, but she would rather not have Su Chen do that.</p>
 <p>She was terrified, anxious, and even regretful.</p>
 <p>Yes, she completely regretted everything at this point.</p>
 <p>She regretted letting her emotions overwhelm her. Tears flowed out of her eyes uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>She flew through the air as she watched Su Chen fight the horde of Sand Race soldiers that surrounded him.</p>
 <p>One of the Light Shaking Realm cultivators was personally attacking, filling the sky with sand that rushed towards Su Chen. Obviously, they knew that now was not the time to fight a prolonged battle, so they were determined to finish off the battle quickly.</p>
 <p>The other Light Shaking Realm cultivator had charged over at Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>He was as fast as lightning.</p>
 <p>A confident smile hung on his face.</p>
 <p>Did you think you would be able to get away just because you retreated one step earlier?</p>
 <p>How naive!</p>
 <p>How could a Yang Opening Realm cultivator outrun a Light Shaking Realm cultivator?</p>
 <p>A smile of victory appeared on the Light Shaking Realm cultivator’s face.</p>
 <p>He was going to capture this brat, and then indulge in his lustful desires. Such a beautiful woman was definitely a peerless treasure amongst the human race!</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was completely petrified by the vicious expression on the Light Shaking Realm cultivator’s face.</p>
 <p>She stared at him in shock, her face deathly pale. Tears were forming at the corner of her eyes. They did come from fear, right? It really was an incredibly charming appearance.</p>
 <p>The Sand Race Light Shaking Realm cultivator became even more aroused.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, you’re better off under my care!” With a ferocious howl, sand began to gather around him and formed a large hand that reached out to grab Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao didn’t move at all and allowed the Sand Race individual’s hands to wrap around herself. In that instance, her life was in the opponent’s hands.</p>
 <p>However, she continued to maintain her weak and pitiful appearance. Her body trembled slightly, and fear was written all over her face. The Sand Race cultivator’s heart trembled, and his grip lessened considerably.</p>
 <p>“You wouldn’t kill me, right?”</p>
 <p>“Of course I wouldn’t kill you,” the Light Shaking Realm cultivator said gently.</p>
 <p>“You’ll love and take care of me, right?”</p>
 <p>“Of course. I will love and take care of you,” the Light Shaking Realm cultivator replied adoringly.</p>
 <p>“You will protect me and not let anyone harm me, right?”</p>
 <p>“Of course. I will protect you and stop anyone who tries to harm you,” the Light Shaking Realm cultivator replied steadfastly.</p>
 <p>“You will obey me. Anything that I say, you will do. Is that right?”</p>
 <p>“Of course. I will obey you. Anything you say, I will do,” the Light Shaking Realm cultivator replied, his eyes burning with passion.</p>
 <p>“You will respect me and worship me and take me as your leader. If your leader commands it, you would leap headfirst into a fire and risk your life for her. Right?”</p>
 <p>“Of course. I will take you as my leader and respect and worship you. If my leader commands it, I will leap headfirst into a fire and risk my life for her!” the Light Shaking Realm cultivator replied as he got down on one knee.</p>
