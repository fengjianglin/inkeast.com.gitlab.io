 <p>Chapter 37: Negotiations (1)</p>
 <p>Any normal Yang Opening Realm cultivator would have been cleaved into two by this overbearing, ruthless blade strike.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Ba Lieyuan and Zhao Jingwen weren’t normal Yang Opening Realm cultivators.</p>
 <p>They were both trusted subordinates of their respective clans. Naturally, their clans’ bloodlines had been implanted into them. Of those with mixed bloodlines, they were the closest to being pure-blooded.</p>
 <p>As Su Chen’s blade surged domineeringly towards the two of them, a bloody glow began to emanate from their bodies.</p>
 <p>A blood-colored demonic fox appeared, its bewitching eyes staring at Su Chen as it jabbed out with a finger. This finger jab merged into Zhao Jingwen’s spear attack — this was Zhao Jingwen’s Heavenly Fox Spear that he had developed. Every bloodline had its own core Bloodline Skills and some derivative Origin Skills. The latter might not be the most powerful, but they were definitely the most flexible.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a Large-Bellied Pig Dragon appeared behind Ba Lieyuan. Its massive body began to exude a massive amount of energy as if it were a Prehistoric Beast that had reawakened; its powerful aura threatened to extinguish all life in its surroundings. This power fused with Ba Lieyuan’s Inferno Blade, imbuing it with a frightening deathly aura.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Wolf Spear, Pig Dragon Tooth Spike!</p>
 <p>The two powerful Bloodline Origin Skills exploded forth, simultaneously slamming into Su Chen’s Primordial Blood Incarnation.</p>
 <p>An instant later, a blindingly brilliant light shone forth, and a violent explosion of energy surged through the entire castle, causing portions of it to collapse before they reformed.</p>
 <p>People who didn’t know any better would have thought that two Light Shaking Realm cultivators were fighting each other.</p>
 <p>Su Chen was forced back again, but this time he didn’t get off so easy. Blood was trickling down from the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>Ba Lieyuan and Zhao Jingwen had also received some minor injuries.</p>
 <p>The three of them glanced at each other, both sides feeling some surprise.</p>
 <p>“Who is this guy?” Zhao Jingwen blurted out.</p>
 <p>Two powerful experts with Demonic Emperor Bloodlines had failed to defeat their opponent even when teaming up. This was simply too shocking for them.</p>
 <p>Their opponent hadn’t even used his full strength.</p>
 <p>This was very easy for them to determine, because Su Chen was still maintaining You Tianyang’s appearance.</p>
 <p>He still had spare energy to keep up a disguise!</p>
 <p>Su Chen shook his head, a trace of excitement appearing in his eyes. “Demonic Emperor Bloodlines...... They are truly extraordinary. I can take on ten normal Yang Opening Realm cultivators without any problems, but the two of you are enough to hold me back. This is truly addicting! But I haven’t reached my upper limit yet. Taste another blade strike first!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the Primordial Blood Incarnation behind him surged with energy, immediately growing to a height of fifty feet.</p>
 <p>More specifically, this was its actual size. In the past few years, Su Chen’s cultivation base hadn’t gone up much, but his development of Origin Skills hadn’t stagnated in the least. The Primordial Blood Incarnation had also improved repeatedly.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Mountain-Beheading Blade had also grown.</p>
 <p>The larger the blade became, the stronger it was, making it extremely compatible with Su Chen’s Primordial Blood Incarnation. In addition, the blade’s surface was now coated with a layer of shadowy flames.</p>
 <p>Even though they had never seen Su Chen’s shadowy flames before, everyone knew that those flames weren’t just for decoration.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s expression changed drastically as she yelled, “Everyone, be careful!”</p>
 <p>She gestured with her hands, causing a wave of fragrant incense to billow forth from her hands.</p>
 <p>The incense contained a kind of bewitching substance and was extremely compatible with the Heavenly Fox’s charming effect. It had a very powerful confusion effect.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Su Chen knew about all of the Zhu Clan’s tactics. This method was totally ineffective against him.</p>
 <p>Su Chen took in a long breath, sucking in the fragrant incense like a whale would suck in water, then shook his head and said, “Smells great!”</p>
 <p>“You......” Zhu Xianyao exclaimed in shock.</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s gaze was clear and showed no trace of being bewitched.</p>
 <p>He stared calmly at the three of them. “You three should team up. Let’s have ourselves a good fight!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the Mountain-Beheading Blade surged forward.</p>
 <p>Even a Light Shaking Realm cultivator would need to take this blade strike seriously.</p>
 <p>Upon sensing the frightening aura emanating from the blade, Zhu Xianyao, Ba Lieyuan, and the others all felt their expressions fall.</p>
 <p>They didn’t know if they could defend against the blow, but they had no choice! They could only guard!</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, Su Chen’s arm suddenly froze in place, and the blade remained suspended in midair.</p>
 <p>He tilted his head, as though he were listening for something, and then said, “Our guests are here.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, he actually pulled his blade back.</p>
 <p>He could actually pull this blade strike back on a whim without any backlash. This meant one thing: he had yet to use his full strength. On the other hand, the three of them could only feel despair when facing this blade strike.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao and the others all wore expressions of shock.</p>
 <p>Who was this person?</p>
 <p>How could he so powerful to this extent?</p>
 <p>When he heard Su Chen’s words, Shi Mingfeng said, “It’s them?”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Su Chen agreed.</p>
 <p>Shi Mingfeng unleashed a palm strike, raindrops shooting forth from his palm and merging to form a large wall of water. This wall of water wasn’t straight but had many curves, making it look like an extremely uneven mirror. It perfectly separated the people fighting, another demonstration of the Rain Master’s exquisite control over water-type Origin Energy.</p>
 <p>The two groups were forced apart after just having been in battle not long before. Shi Mingfeng said, “Pall is here. Everyone, stop for now!”</p>
 <p>Pall?</p>
 <p>Everyone was stunned when they heard that name.</p>
 <p>Wasn’t that Sand Race Leader still all the way back at Ali Palace? Why was he here now?</p>
 <p>Su Chen said, “If you don’t believe me, ask him.”</p>
 <p>He pointed the Mountain-Beheading Blade at Culler.</p>
 <p>Culler smiled savagely. “Leader had never trusted you humans in the first place. He knew that you humans would definitely have ulterior motives. This is why we purposefully used you to search for the secret treasure so that we could swoop in and snatch it later. Now that Leader is here, you guys are dead for sure.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was stunned when she heard this. She stared at Su Chen and asked, “You guys have known about this for awhile now?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen shrugged. “It was just a suspicion, but now we’ve confirmed it.”</p>
 <p>“So what if you’ve confirmed it?” Zhu Baiyu said harshly. “You dare plot against the Zhu Clan and steal the Zhu Clan’s benefits? You will all die!”</p>
 <p>Shi Mingfeng chuckled, “Steal the Zhu Clan’s benefits? Zhu Baiyu, you’ve got it all wrong. You got the news about West Laina Castle from the Immortal Temple, so you’re the one who’s trying to steal our business. How did you spin it to be the other way around?”</p>
 <p>“......That.” Zhu Baiyu froze. It was only then that she realized that they had found out about the secrets in West Laina Castle from the Immortal Temple.</p>
 <p>After so much squabbling, it wasn’t the Immortal Temple robbing the Zhu Clan but the Zhu Clan robbing the Immortal Temple?</p>
 <p>When Shi Mingfeng put it that way, everyone was immediately rendered speechless.</p>
 <p>Whether or not logic was useful often depended on the people involved, the timing, and the exact circumstances.</p>
 <p>Trying to be rational under some circumstances was totally useless.</p>
 <p>While under other circumstances, being rational could have a huge effect.</p>
 <p>This was a perfect example of that: originally, the Zhu Clan had thought that the Immortal Temple’s people had set up an ambush for them to try and swoop in at the last moment and steal their rewards. As such, they felt that their indignation was justified and were naturally prepared to fight to the death.</p>
 <p>But now that Shi Mingfeng had turned their logic on its own head, it was the Zhu Clan who was robbing the Immortal Temple, who were then justified in counterattacking. The flames of anger in everyone’s hearts were doused significantly.</p>
 <p>Without this anger, even though they were still enemies, they were no longer at the point where they would rather die than give the opponent an advantage, so negotiations would happen much more easily.</p>
 <p>Su Chen said, “Pall has arrived and will be here soon. He is a Light Shaking Realm cultivator with five Lotus Platforms and also has a number of experts under his command. If we continue like this, the only outcome is that we will all be wiped out in one fell swoop.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Baiyu’s gaze grew focused. “You mean?”</p>
 <p>“We should team up and deal with the intruders first,” Su Chen replied.</p>
