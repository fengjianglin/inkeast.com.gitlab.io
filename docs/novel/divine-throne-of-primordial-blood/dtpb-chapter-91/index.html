 <p>Chapter 91: Spirit Seeking</p>
 <p>In the pond of water below the cliff, the water slowly rippled on the surface.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo rose from the water like a lotus. In the moment she left the water, she shook her long hair, causing water droplets to fly through the air. They glistened under the shining of the sunlight.</p>
 <p>Although they were deep into winter, the physiques of Origin Qi Scholar made it so that she did not fear the cold at all. She swam through the water quickly, frolicking around. One felt that nature was truly harmonious and beautiful.</p>
 <p>Su Chen was sitting on a large tree not too faraway, watching Gu Qingluo taking a bath.</p>
 <p>When embezzlement was done to this kind of point, he could also be considered in a certain realm.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, Su Chen did not possess any lecherous thoughts. He stared at Gu Qingluo, but his sight was penetrating her skin to observe the Origin Energy flow.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but stare.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo had just activated her bloodline power a moment ago, and there were still remnant traces of her bloodline flowing, making the Origin Energy flow very apparent. However, as time passed, the Origin Energy flow would become fainter.</p>
 <p>Thus, Su Chen needed to use his time well.</p>
 <p>His eyes were fixed on the Origin Energy flow in Gu Qingluo’s body. Su Chen seemingly saw a kind of almost illusive law of Origin Energy conduction. He couldn’t say clearly what it was, but as he watched a feeling suddenly emerged in his heart. It was like there was some kind of philosophical theory that had appeared before Su Chen eyes. There was no way to describe it in words; he could only understand it by using his body.</p>
 <p>Right, understanding it by using his own body!</p>
 <p>If someone had the same eyes as Su Chen at this moment, they would discover that at this moment inside Su Chen’s body, the Origin Energy flow actually bore some resemblance to Gu Qingluo. The traces of movement, the frequency of jumping, the ebb and flow of the Origin Energy, and the strange changes as it flowed, all resembled what was happening in Gu Qingluo’s body.</p>
 <p>However, this was only a resemblance!</p>
 <p>“Pu!” Su Chen suddenly felt the Qi and blood in his body boiling over. A sweet taste filled his mouth, as if he had been on the receiving end of a fierce punch. He spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>Dammit!</p>
 <p>Su Chen knew that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>Attempting to move the Origin Energy in his body of his own initiative to copy the Soaring Serpent bloodline was definitely courting death.</p>
 <p>Spitting out a mouthful of blood was already quite light. If the side effects had been more severe, he could have become mentally deranged or even died.</p>
 <p>Even so, Su Chen’s circumstances were still not that great. Apart from spitting out a mouthful of blood, Su Chen discovered that a heaviness had set into his legs.</p>
 <p>A hard-to-describe feeling of heaviness!</p>
 <p>If the Snaking Mist Steps made one feel light and floaty, as if someone had halved one’s body weight, then the opposite was true at that moment.</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s legs felt as heavy as if lead had been poured into them. He felt as if every step drained him of an incredible amount of strength.</p>
 <p>Su Chen was unable to stand up for a moment, then sat down next to the tree, drained of energy.</p>
 <p>Was this the consequence of recklessness?</p>
 <p>Su Chen bitterly smiled.</p>
 <p>His attempt at gaining an advantage had really come back to bite him.</p>
 <p>He pounded his own leg a little bit, attempting to restore the Origin Energy in his body to normal. Finally, Su Chen felt like his condition had improved slightly.</p>
 <p>He let out a sigh of relief - this implied that the effect was only temporary.</p>
 <p>However, Su Chen also knew that this was because his cultivation base was low, and he didn’t have much Origin power yet. He had also cultivated the Snaking Mist Steps, resulting in relatively light consequences. If he had been in any different situation, his legs may have been crippled.</p>
 <p>Imitating the motion of Origin Energy was extremely dangerous. Su Chen was sobered, no longer daring to continue to try. However, that step in midair that he had been able to take earlier caused his heart to itch with desire. He always had a feeling, which was that even if he didn’t have the Soaring Serpent Bloodline, he could also do the same thing as Gu Qingluo.</p>
 <p>Thus, he was extremely conflicted internally. He was like a youth standing in front of an intersection, gazing at the roads as they disappeared in the distance, unsure which road he should take.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo, however, did not know what he was thinking about at that moment.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Su Chen just sitting on the ground, his face deathly pale, she asked, “Hey, what’s wrong with you?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen didn’t want her to know that he had been injured, so he hurriedly replied, “Nothing much, I was just thinking about something. Last time you were investigating the Spirit Burying Terrace, did you discover anything interesting?</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this question, Gu Qingluo’s attention had been diverted. She poured a handful of water over herself and sighed, “Nothing really. After so many years and changes over time, no one knows where the Spirit Burying Terrace is located anymore. The only thing for certain is that it must be around this area, most likely near......”</p>
 <p>“Scarlet Mountain Range,” Su Chen suddenly said. “The Spirit Burying Terrace is in the Scarlet Mountain Range.”</p>
 <p>“How do you know?” Gu Qingluo asked with curiosity.</p>
 <p>Su Chen replied, “Not long ago, that organization asked me to help them deliver a shipment of goods. These included a few medicinal herbs such as Blueheart Grass or the Apeblood Flower.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo’s eyes lit up. “Blueheart Grass is used to concoct poison antidotes, while the Apeblood Flower is the main ingredient used to refine the Beast Repellent Medicine.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen laughed. “So you know that as well.”</p>
 <p>“Hmph, I am very learned,” Gu Qingluo replied bluntly. “Are there any other clues?”</p>
 <p>“The first time that I ran into them, when I was secretly listening in on their conversation, they mentioned a Purple Bloodflower and rock powder.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo knitted her eyebrows. “Purple Bloodflowers are used in many applications such as soul-strengthening, meditation, and warding off evil, so it’s hard to tell what they need it for. As for rock powder...... why would they need to use it?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo didn’t know.</p>
 <p>Su Chen replied, “The rock powder was a special kind that would create a giant explosion when infused with Origin Energy.”</p>
 <p>“It could be used to create explosions? How powerful is it?” Gu Qingluo was surprised.</p>
 <p>“It’s more than sufficient to break through mountain rock.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo fell silent.</p>
 <p>A long time later, she said, “Although Blueheart grass is used to concoct antidotes, there are also other kinds of antidotes out there. Antidotes made from Blueheart Grass are not usually used to treat beast poison, but rather poison from miasma.”</p>
 <p>“Poison from miasma?” Su Chen was slightly dazed. He didn’t actually know that fact. “Are there places in the Scarlet Mountain Range that have poisonous miasmas?”</p>
 <p>“There are. For instance, Peach Blossom Peak, Hundred Birds Peak, Western Limit Peak, Flying Forest Peak, or Red Dawn Peak - it can be found in many different locations.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen immediately said, “If they need rock powder to break through all the rocks, then it must be a location with quite a bit of rock.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo followed up, “Purple Bloodflower can calm one’s soul, so there could possibly be an illusion realm or Vicious Beasts that can unleash soul attacks nearby.”</p>
 <p>The two of them verbalized their reasoning in rapid succession, and they were able to narrow down to one mountain range.</p>
 <p>“It should be somewhere in the Red Peak Range,” Gu Qingluo said with assurance.</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, the area of the Red Peak Range is still too large,” Su Chen sighed.</p>
 <p>The Red Peak Range was located in the Western area of the Scarlet Mountain Range. There were four mountain peaks near it and two canyons. Su Chen and Gu Qingluo had only narrowed the location down to the Red Peak Range. As for where it was exactly, that was harder to say. Such a large area was enough to store more than a hundred Spirit Burying Terraces, let alone one.</p>
 <p>“What? You want to go there?” Gu Qingluo asked Su Chen.</p>
 <p>Su Chen replied, “For the organization to spend so much effort to unearth the Spirit Burying Terrace means that there must be some very good things inside. How could I not want to verify that for myself?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo continued, “You probably don’t just want to verify it for yourself; you want to take advantage of the situation for your own benefit, don’t you’?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen replied straightforwardly, “How could I, Su Chen, do such a thing?”</p>
 <p>However, Su Chen then added on, “But you do know that blind people ‘see’ by using their hands and touching something...... repeatedly touching it.”</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingluo was also rendered speechless by Su Chen.</p>
 <p>After thinking for a moment, she said, “That Spirit Burying Terrace, they haven’t opened it yet, right?”</p>
 <p>“Some people are already beginning to dig up the entrance. They say that it will take another half of a year or so before it can be opened.”</p>
 <p>“Half a year......” Gu Qingluo hemmed for a moment before saying, “How is your relationship with this organization?”</p>
 <p>“Not too bad. The last two times I went to the Scarlet Mountain Range, I borrowed their Origin Tools, and not long ago I participated in a quite successful collaboration with them.”</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, I think I have a method which can help you get into the Spirit Burying Terrace.”</p>
