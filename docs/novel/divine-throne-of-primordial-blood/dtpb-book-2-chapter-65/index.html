 <p>Chapter 65: Snow Ribbon, Soft Fingertips</p>
 <p>Su Chen would never have expected that, when he went to chase after Zhang Sheng’an, everyone else had already made their own decisions.</p>
 <p>No one chose to retreat; they had all chosen opponents for themselves.</p>
 <p>They wanted to battle, using their own tactics to viciously strike back at their opponents!</p>
 <p>Zheng Xia and Du Qing fought Guan Shanying, Cloud Leopard fought Zhong Ding, and Wang Doushan fought Sword Rhinoceros Zheng Kuang.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>An illusory image of the Snow Crane appeared, sending a flurry of fists towards Zheng Kuang.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang coldly harrumphed. He stabbed forwards with the spear in his hand. An extremely powerful wave of Qi surged forwards, slamming into the punches. The fists that Wang Doushan had conjured were forcibly shattered.</p>
 <p>The fists exploded into bursts of color like flowers falling to the ground.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>The Overlord Spear stabbed out again, this time charging towards Wang Doushan’s chest as if it were cutting through the void.</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan met it with a punch. The snow-white glow enveloping him exuded a shocking aura.</p>
 <p>The fist slammed into the spear, generating a powerful blast of air.</p>
 <p>“AWOO!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Zheng Kuang suddenly howled. An image of a rhinoceros appeared behind him. The giant rhinoceros lowered its head and charged, the spear forming the rhino’s horn. This attack possessed fearsome might that was not present before. Wang Doushan’s fist was unable to resist it and was instantly sent flying.</p>
 <p>Having sent Wang Doushan flying with just one blow, Zheng Kuang waved his spear and laughed. “Wang Doushan, you weren’t my opponent four years ago. Now, you’re even more outmatched. If you’re trying to fight me, you must want to die pretty badly!”</p>
 <p>“Shut the fuck up,” Wang Doushan cursed as he got back up.</p>
 <p>He wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth before saying, “Last time was just because you ambushed me while I was wounded. Like hell that’s considered a win.”</p>
 <p>“Then what about this time?” Zheng Kuang swept the spear in an arc in front of him, attacking Wang Doushan.</p>
 <p>“This time I’ll cut you to pieces!” Wang Doushan suddenly leapt into the air.</p>
 <p>Just when Zheng Kuang’s Overlord Spear was about to hit Wang Doushan, two columns of light gathered around Wang Doushan’s arms. “Cloud Sundering!”</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang raised his palm, erecting an azure barrier of light in front of him.</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan’s Cloud Sundering slammed into the azure light barrier, causing it to instantly shatter. The remaining force washed over Zheng Kuang, sending him flying.</p>
 <p>However, when he was thrown into the air, a golden luster began to shine on Zheng Kuang’s body. Wang Doushan’s powerful Origin Skill had pushed Zheng Kuang away, but it hadn’t done any actual damage.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang shook his head and said, “Not bad, brat. You have gotten stronger recently. At the very least, you were able to shatter my azure light barrier. Unfortunately, my Sword Rhinoceros clan never relies on barriers to do battle. Our physical bodies are our greatest advantage!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he growled and leapt into the air. The Overlord Spear in his hand stabbed downwards, carrying with it a shockingly bright light. Waves of powerful wind rolled off of the spear. The wind alone felt like a blade cutting into Wang Doushan’s face.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang’s spear really was frighteningly strong.</p>
 <p>This was the Sword Rhinoceros Clan’s Annihilation Spear!</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan leapt into the air, his fat body displaying a surprising nimbleness. The Snow Crane image behind him flapped its wings as it soared through the air, quickly carrying Wang Doushan off into the distance.</p>
 <p>“You can’t run!” Zheng Kuang yelled arrogantly as he charged forwards with his spear.</p>
 <p>He was not good at twisting and turning in small spaces, but his ability to charge in one direction was much more impressive.</p>
 <p>He pointed the Overlord Spear straight forwards, accumulating a shocking momentum. Wherever he went, trees were toppled and flocks of birds were forced into the air.</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan extended his arms and flapped them, like an eagle soaring through the air.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang continued to charge, streaking through the air and scattering light as he moved.</p>
 <p>The two of them kept moving, one chasing the other. They exchanged numerous blows, but neither was able to claim an advantage.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Wang Doushan stretched out his arms. As he flew into the air, he unleashed another Cloud Sundering. This was extremely sudden, leaving Zheng Kuang no time to dodge. However, he completely ignored it. The golden luster appeared on his body once more as he blocked Wang Doushan’s attack. The Overlord Spear in his hand stabbed out once again.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>In a violent explosion, Wang Doushan’s Cloud Sundering slammed into Zheng Kuang as Zheng Kuang’s Overlord Spear also penetrated his barrier. The spear stabbed right into Wang Doushan’s left arm.</p>
 <p>A powerful wave of energy surged into Wang Doushan’s arm, mangling his elbow.</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan howled in pain as he fell to the ground. Zheng Kuang, however, continued forwards as if nothing had happened to him. He said, “Don’t blame me for being cruel. Since a grudge exists between us now, I must tear it up by the roots. It’s your fault for being so dumb and insisting on mixing with non-bloodline students.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the Overlord Spear in his hand began to descend.</p>
 <p>Just as it was about to pierce into Wang Doushan’s body, however, he suddenly raised his arms, blocking the incoming spear. At that moment, the tip of the spear was only a single centimeter away from Wang Doushan’s face.</p>
 <p>However, the spear had no way of closing that centimeter-wide gap.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a turbulent flow of Qi began to gather around Zheng Kuang’s arms and then around the Overlord Spear.</p>
 <p>“AWOO!”</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang howled. The Sword Rhinoceros once again appeared behind his back as he shoved the spear forwards, once again sending Wang Doushan flying.</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan slammed into countless trees before falling to the ground, unable to stand.</p>
 <p>The Sword Rhinoceros Zheng Clan was extremely good at battles of brute strength. They possess powerful offensive and defensive capabilities, and the Overlord Spear was dominant. Their Battle Rhinoceros Body was also peerlessly strong. Thus, Wang Doushan had no hope of beating him directly.</p>
 <p>Having sent Wang Doushan flying again, Zheng Kuang laughed in delight, “I told you already, you’re not my opponent!”</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan spit out a mouthful of blood. “I admit that your Battle Rhinoceros Body is very powerful. With just my two hands, I won’t be able to break through it. Thankfully, I have never been a person who does battle with just my bare fists.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Zheng Kuang was caught off-guard.</p>
 <p>He had never heard of Wang Doushan using any kind of Origin Tool when battling others. This was his first time hearing that Wang Doushan didn’t battle with just his bare fists.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang said disdainfully, “If that’s the case, you might as well bring out your Origin Tool.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve been using it for a long time already; you just haven’t noticed,” Wang Doushan calmly replied.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang froze. He suddenly felt that something wasn’t right. He lowered his head, only to discover that at some point his body had been covered in numerous small wounds.</p>
 <p>The wounds were small, as if he had been cut open by bumping into something. They looked like thin red lines, and fresh blood was seeping out from them. However, these wounds were all over his body.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang discovered that every inch of his body was bleeding. In the blink of an eye he was covered in blood.</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang was alarmed. “What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p>
 <p>His Battle Rhinoceros Body was rendered completely useless. He had suddenly become a human sieve as blood oozed out from his every pore.</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan slowly stood up. “I told you already, I am not someone who battles with just his bare hands. Most people, however, don’t have the right to see my Origin Tool.”</p>
 <p>He raised his arm. Streaks of white light suddenly shot out from within Zheng Kuang’s body.</p>
 <p>The streaks of light were incredibly thin. If it weren’t for the fact that they had all appeared at once, he wouldn’t have noticed them at all.</p>
 <p>The streaks of light gathered near Wang Doushan’s fingertip, eventually forming a ribbon of white light.</p>
 <p>“That is……” Zheng Kuang</p>
 <p>“Snow Thread,” Wang Doushan replied. “My Origin Tool can be split into thousands of tiny pieces and also form a whole again.. However, it is a very ‘soft’ Origin tool. If I used it to engage in a battle of brute strength with you, I would have definitely lost. Thus, I could only conceal it in my Bloodline Origin Skills, activating it stealthily. Every time we exchanged blows, it permeated through your body a little more until at the very end they burst out. This permeation is not completely undetectable. It still results in wounds to your body. Someone who is a little more clear-headed might have sensed it after one or two exchanges and taken appropriate measures. Thankfully…… you aren’t that kind of person. Sword Rhinoceros Zheng Kuang, you are strong, but you don’t use your head. All you have is dominant strength, and you never learned to use your head in battle. That’s why you will die today.”</p>
 <p>Zheng Kuang’s heart trembled. He lowered his head to look at himself.</p>
 <p>At that moment, it seemed as if the last vestiges of energy keeping him together disappeared.</p>
 <p>As Wang Doushan spoke, Zheng Kuang’s body trembled, then scattered.</p>
 <p>Yes, scattered.</p>
 <p>As if he was a pile of building blocks, every inch of his body had been cut into small pieces that eventually fallen apart. He fragmented, collapsed, and died.</p>
 <p>Wang Doushan suddenly spit out a mouthful of blood and his vision began to swim.</p>
 <p>He muttered, “Killing you…… wasn’t easy at all.”</p>
