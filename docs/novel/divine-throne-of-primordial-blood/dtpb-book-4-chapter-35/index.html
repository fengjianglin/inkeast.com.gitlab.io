 <p>Chapter 35: Darkness Demon</p>
 <p>Regardless of what the summoned creature was, this summoned darkness beast obviously did not have any good intentions.</p>
 <p>Its furious, unrestrained howls gave away the summoned darkness beast’s malicious intent. Waves of dark energy surged forward from its body as it yelled, “Become food for the darkness!”</p>
 <p>“Careful! Everyone back up!” Zhu Baiyu yelled.</p>
 <p>A blood-colored energy rose up from the surroundings to meet the wave of darkness. The two opposing waves of energy clashed, unleashing a frightening wave of energy that threatened to wipe out everyone present. Anything that these waves of energy touched would immediately disintegrate, but then reform an instant later.</p>
 <p>This place was quite good for doing battle. No matter what kind of damage occurred, it would quickly repair itself.</p>
 <p>“You insignificant insects, remember my name! I am the Darkness Demon Heath!” the summoned darkness beast howled. Dark clouds began to gather and turned into a massive two-sided lance that pierced down at Zhu Baiyu.</p>
 <p>“How arrogant!” Zhu Baiyu harrumphed as he jabbed out with his finger.</p>
 <p>This single jab carried with it the bewitching aura of the Heavenly Fox and the power of a Demonic Emperor as it raced towards the Darkness Demon. As soon as it touched the long lance, it exploded with a brilliant light.</p>
 <p>“ARGHH!” The Darkness Demon howled in pain. The massive spear fragmented under Zhu Baiyu’s finger strike and turned back into black fog. The bright light was like poison as it corroded the Darkness Demon, causing its body to grow much smaller.</p>
 <p>“Damn bastard!” the Darkness Demon howled angrily as the black waves surged forward again.</p>
 <p>An arm of one the Zhu Clan’s guards was swept up by the darkness; his entire arm turned into dark fog that then dissipated.</p>
 <p>“No! Save me!” the guard yelled, but he could only watch as the darkness continued to eat away at him until he faded away.</p>
 <p>Everyone felt fear rising in their hearts as they watched a person be swallowed up by darkness just like that.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, activate your Origin Energy barriers and attack from range. Don’t get into close-quarters combat with it!” Zhu Xianyao yelled.</p>
 <p>This was the best way to deal with the Darkness Demon.</p>
 <p>Only Su Chen’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>Shadow Substance!</p>
 <p>He could finally confirm that this Darkness Demon’s body was made entirely out of Shadow Substance.</p>
 <p>Su Chen had obtained Shadow Substance from the little black stones earlier. Because their origin was mysterious, Su Chen had never found another way to extract more apart from recycling it from his own abilities.</p>
 <p>However, without new Shadow Substance, Su Chen would have a very hard time producing more Shadow Servants, and even strengthening the current Shadow Servants would be quite difficult.</p>
 <p>But now, Su Chen had actually discovered a lifeform whose body was literally made of Shadow Substance.</p>
 <p>How could he not be excited?</p>
 <p>At this moment, everyone was locked in battle with the Darkness Demon. Su Chen was standing to the side, carefully watching the Darkness Demon fight.</p>
 <p>The Darkness Demon was exceptionally powerful and seemed to possess boundless stores of darkness power that was extremely corrosive. Anyone who came into contact with the dark fog, even if a little bit, would rapidly disintegrate.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Zhao Jingwen’s Origin Energy barrier shattered. Before the new barrier could form, a bit of the Darkness Demon’s darkness-type Origin Energy came into contact with his body. He acted quite decisively and cut off the piece of meat from his own shoulder and threw it on the ground. That chunk of meat rapidly dissolved into black fog and disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>The corrosive power of the darkness was really quite frightening.</p>
 <p>In Su Chen’s eyes, this was just the concentrated Shadow Substance attempting to find a target to corrode.</p>
 <p>This was a special corrosive property of the Shadow Substance. Su Chen had found this out a long time ago when he had combined it with his flames to make the Shadow Flame Giant. However, the amount of Shadow Substance he possessed was limited, as was the corrosive ability of the giant. He never expected that Shadow Substance could have such a shocking corrosive ability when it became concentrated enough.</p>
 <p>The presence of this much Origin Substance was a huge pile of treasure in Su Chen’s eyes!</p>
 <p>His eyes flickered with greed.</p>
 <p>“Tianyang, what are you doing!” Zhu Xianyao yelled when she discovered Su Chen’s strange movements.</p>
 <p>The current Su Chen had voluntarily let down his barrier and gotten close.</p>
 <p>Was he trying to get himself killed?</p>
 <p>HOWL!</p>
 <p>The Darkness Demon swung its arm at Su Chen.</p>
 <p>Su Chen raised his blade. The Darkness Demon’s arm wasn’t sturdy and was immediately sliced through.</p>
 <p>However, the broken arm still hit Su Chen’s body. A large quantity of darkness began to envelope his body. Zhu Xianyao screamed as if she was the one being killed.</p>
 <p>An instant later, however, the darkness seemed to come under Su Chen’s control, eventually gathering near his left hand before disappearing without a trace.</p>
 <p>“How is this possible?” the Darkness Demon howled in shock.</p>
 <p>It could sense that there was something on this human’s left hand that could exert incredible control over itself.</p>
 <p>It was like the frost melting under a scorching hot sun.</p>
 <p>Large amounts of Shadow Substance entered the Shadow Glove. This unique item immediately surged with power. Because Su Chen’s blood was connected with it, Su Chen could even sense a kind of satisfaction emanating from it!</p>
 <p>It was the satisfaction that came from eating a full meal.</p>
 <p>Obviously, Su Chen wasn’t planning on letting things go just like that.</p>
 <p>The target in front of him was a huge sink of Shadow Substance. If he missed this opportunity, he would regret it for a long time.</p>
 <p>Su Chen lifted his left hand and swung it at the Darkness Demon.</p>
 <p>With a tearing sound, Su Chen ripped off a large chunk of the dark fog on the darkness demon’s body.</p>
 <p>The glove on his hand began to glow faintly and rapidly absorbed the dark fog.</p>
 <p>An instant later, Su Chen swung again.</p>
 <p>As if he was eating a lamb or a cow, Su Chen cleaved away at his opponent blow after blow, consuming it bit by bit. Large quantities of Shadow Substance surged into the glove, constantly raising the power of the Shadow Glove.</p>
 <p>“NO!” the Darkness Demon howled in fear.</p>
 <p>It couldn’t understand how his opponent was doing this, but it knew that every successful attack of Su Chen’s would weaken it until it couldn’t fight anymore.</p>
 <p>The Darkness Demon finally felt fear and began to retreat.</p>
 <p>“Don’t let it get away!” Su Chen yelled.</p>
 <p>The other people also realized that Su Chen’s glove could restrain the Darkness Demon and began to strengthen their attacks to try and keep it in place.</p>
 <p>The Darkness Demon howled repeatedly and tried to escape. It was not nearly as threatening as it was before. It looked just like a creature made of sludge as it crawled along the ground. However, Chef Su Chen stopped it at every step of the way and continued to cut away at it.</p>
 <p>Once Su Chen had torn off a final chunk of Shadow Substance, the Darkness Demon could no longer maintain its physical form and disintegrated.</p>
 <p>Large quantities of dark fog billowed everywhere as it dissipated, leaving behind a bit of grey powder behind.</p>
 <p>Su Chen picked up a bit of the powder. The powder contained large quantities of Shadow Substance. When he saw the powder, Su Chen was reminded of the black stones he had obtained previously.</p>
 <p>He started to understand the origins of those black stones.</p>
 <p>Su Chen carefully collected the powder without wasting it.</p>
 <p>They still were full of research value.</p>
 <p>When he stood back up, he found that everyone around him had a strange look on their faces.</p>
