 <p>Chapter 111: Forgotten</p>
 <p>Time flew by.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, another month had gone by.</p>
 <p>Finally, the time had come for the hostage to be released.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was wearing the long purple dress that she wore when she first met Su Chen. She sat in front of the dressing table, dressing herself.</p>
 <p>She brushed her hair with a jade comb, her hair fluttering like the leaves of a willow tree. Yet, she could not ignore nor calm the stirring within her heart.</p>
 <p>She suddenly placed the comb down and said, “Can you help me change my bun?”</p>
 <p>“Me?” Su Chen, who was standing behind Zhu Xianyao, was startled.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao laughed. “Is there someone else here?”</p>
 <p>A troubled expression appeared on Su Chen’s face. “I don’t know how.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll teach you.”</p>
 <p>After hesitating for a moment, Su Chen walked over and began to redo Zhu Xianyao’s hair.</p>
 <p>Because he had never done it before, his movements were clumsy.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao didn’t become frustrated as she gently guided his movements.</p>
 <p>After redoing it multiple times, Su Chen finally helped Zhu Xianyao redo her bun.</p>
 <p>Staring in the mirror, he said, “It’s a bit tilted.”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine,” Zhu Xianyao laughed. “This is nice.”</p>
 <p>Then, she asked in a lower voice, “We won’t meet again after today, right?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s heart trembled slightly. He replied softly, “Yes.”</p>
 <p>After getting to know each other over the nearly three months, the conflict between the two of them had begun to disappear, and Su Chen also began to have a favorable impression of Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>Even so, there was no way of changing the events that had already happened, and the people who had died could not come back to life. Beneath the gentleness was still that tragic reality, and their enmity simply could not be ignored.</p>
 <p>Thus, even though his heart was weak, he had to cover it with a layer of stone.</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she gazed into Su Chen’s eyes and then suddenly stepped forwards.</p>
 <p>She pressed forwards firmly and kissed him.</p>
 <p>As their lips pressed against each other, Su Chen could sense the intense feelings of love that came from Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>After a long time, they parted.</p>
 <p>She gazed at Su Chen and said, “Su Chen, I......”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Su Chen placed his palm on Zhu Xianyao’s head.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s words were cut off by his sudden palm strike. She stared at Su Chen in shock before her body slowly began to sag.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry. I know what you want to say...... but it cannot be,” Su Chen said.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s lips trembled.</p>
 <p>Darkness began to swallow her.</p>
 <p>The Sorrow-Erasing Baptism began!</p>
 <p>——————————————————</p>
 <p>She opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao found herself lying on a large wooden bed. A woman dressed in a white gown with an exquisite appearance was staring at her.</p>
 <p>“You’re awake?” The white-clothed maiden said, her voice sounding as if it were very far away.</p>
 <p>“I...... where am I?” Zhu Xianyao sat up, cradling her head in her hands.</p>
 <p>The white-clothed maiden helped her up. “You are in my residence at the Hidden Dragon Institute. Don’t worry, everything is done now.”</p>
 <p>“Everything?” Zhu Xianyao stared blankly at her. “Who are you? What do you mean by everything?”</p>
 <p>“What, you don’t remember?” The white-clothed maiden gently smiled. “I’m Yue Longsha.”</p>
 <p>“Yue Longsha?” Zhu Xianyao rubbed her head and thought for a moment before shaking it. “I don’t remember. Why can’t I remember anything? I just remember I came to......”</p>
 <p>She thought for a while before something came to her. She lifted her head and said, “Su Chen! Yes, I came looking for Su Chen!”</p>
 <p>“To try and convince him not to sell Kaihuang’s Heaven?” Yue Longsha continued.</p>
 <p>“How did you know?” Zhu Xianyao’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>“You told me, remember?” Yue Longsha laughed.</p>
 <p>“This cannot be possible!” Zhu Xianyao began to tense up. “I don’t recognize you at all, and I wouldn’t tell this kind of thing to someone else! Uncle Eleven, Uncle Eleven!”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha sighed. “It looks like you have injury-induced amnesia. Your mission failed. Su Chen had already distributed Kaihuang’s Heaven long before you got here. Although you tried to stop its spread in Red Pinewood Forest, you were still a step too slow.”</p>
 <p>As Yue Longsha spoke, she pulled out an Imaging Disk.</p>
 <p>She opened the Imaging Disk, and Zhu Xianyao saw the battle that had occurred.</p>
 <p>She watched as her clan members all died one by one, watched as Ma Renze appeared, and watched as Uncle Eleven was forced by Ma Renze to unleash his power indiscriminately.</p>
 <p>The replay suddenly cut off. Even though she didn’t see Uncle Eleven fall over, Zhu Xianyao still realized something.</p>
 <p>She trembled and painfully moaned. “Uncle Eleven......”</p>
 <p>Then, she stared at Yue Longsha. “Why do you have this Imaging Disk?”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha gently brushed aside a strand of hair across her face. “Explaining things to someone who has lost their memories is pretty complicated. I told you already that my name is Yue Longsha, and I am Yue Wuti’s daughter. The person who killed Uncle Eleven is called Ma Renze, and he is also one of the assassins that murdered my father. On that day, I followed him to try and find an opportunity to enact revenge, but I unexpectedly stumbled upon that battle and recorded it. You sent one copy back to your own clan, and this is the other one that was prepared. Uncle Eleven gravely injured Ma Renze before dying, giving me an opportunity......”</p>
 <p>She pressed the Imaging Disk and another image appeared on it. It was an image of Yue Longsha beheading Ma Renze.</p>
 <p>“This Imaging Disk isn’t complete!” Zhu Xianyao realized something.</p>
 <p>“Ma Renze was still a Light Shaking Realm expert, and he wasn’t easy to kill even though he was seriously injured. I don’t want others to see the trump cards that I used to kill him, so I took some time to fudge it a little,” Yue Longsha indifferently replied.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao lifted her head and gazed at Yue Longsha. “Then what happened afterwards?”</p>
 <p>“Afterwards, we got to know each other and became friends,” Yue Longsha laughed. “Because we both had enmity with the Immortal Temple, we decided to ally against them. Not long after, you and I went to crash one of the Immortal Temple’s secret meetings, but you were injured in the battle. You don’t remember any of this?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao held her head in her hands. “I can’t remember anything.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, this is probably just the repercussions of the injury. Everything will be fine soon,” Yue Longsha comforted her.</p>
 <p>As they slowly talked, Zhu Xianyao began to absorb the information that Su Chen had prepared. She learned that her mission had failed and that her fellow clan members had died. Zhu Xianyao became depressed and listless.</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha fed her a bowl of porridge and helped her go to bed before leaving.</p>
 <p>Su Chen stood outside the door.</p>
 <p>“What do you think?” Yue Longsha asked.</p>
 <p>“She wasn’t lying,” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>To make sure that nothing went wrong, Su Chen had been observing with his Lie Detection Origin Skill while Yue Longsha had been tricking Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>The test verified that she had truly lost her memories.</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s plan had succeeded. From this day onwards, the Zhu Clan’s attention wouldn’t be on Su Chen anymore; rather, their attention would be completely centered on the Immortal Temple.</p>
 <p>Three days later, Zhu Xianyao’s body had completely recovered.</p>
 <p>On that day, Zhu Xianyao officially said her farewells to Yue Longsha and returned to the Zhu Clan.</p>
 <p>On that day, Yue Longsha and Zhu Xianyao reluctantly parted.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao grabbed Yue Longsha’s hands and said quite a few things before unwillingly leaving.</p>
 <p>As she gazed at Zhu Xianyao’s departing figure, Yue Longsha sighed silently before shaking her head and returning to the Hidden Dragon Institute.</p>
 <p>Thus, she did not see Zhu Xianyao’s figure reappear not long after she left.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao gazed at Yue Longsha expressionlessly before turning around and walking off to the side.</p>
 <p>After arriving at a small tea shop near the road, Zhu Xianyao sat down. “Shopkeep!”</p>
 <p>“Coming! What would you like today, guest?” A shriveled old man with a hunched back walked towards her.</p>
 <p>After drawing near to Zhu Xianyao, he said in a low voice, “Greetings, Miss. You’re finally here.”</p>
 <p>“How long has it been before I ‘finally’ came?” Zhu Xianyao asked in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Three months,” the old man replied in a low voice.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s eyes flashed. “Three months? Are you saying that I never tried to contact you during these three months?”</p>
 <p>“Never!”</p>
 <p>“Do you know about what happened during the Red Pinewood Forest Battle?”</p>
 <p>“This little one was still undercover in the Hidden Dragon Institute and did not participate. I do not know what happened there.”</p>
 <p>“Then what about me? Do you know what has been happening to me for the past three months?”</p>
 <p>“I know a bit.” The old man raised his head and stared at Zhu Xianyao as he said, “You have been in the Hidden Dragon Institute for the past three months.”</p>
 <p>“Since you know that I’ve been here the entire time, why didn’t you come looking for me?”</p>
 <p>“I did try to meet youto come looking for you, but Miss never paid me any mind, so I didn’t dare blow my cover.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s expression sank even further.</p>
 <p>“I paid you no mind...... what was I doing then?”</p>
 <p>“Every day at dusk you would go out for a stroll near the Hidden Dragon Institute’s river.”</p>
 <p>“Stroll? With who? Was it Yue Longsha?”</p>
 <p>“Su Chen.”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The cup in Zhu Xianyao’s hand shattered.</p>
