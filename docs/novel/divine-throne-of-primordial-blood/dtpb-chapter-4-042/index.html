 <p>Chapter 42: I Don’t Like It!</p>
 <p>As the voice spoke, a figure emerged from the darkness.</p>
 <p>Eagle Eye Sark.</p>
 <p>“It’s you?” Su Chen’s gaze trembled slightly.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it’s me!” Sark glared coldly at Su Chen. “You killed my younger brother, so I’m here for my revenge. Is that so strange?”</p>
 <p>“Your younger brother?” Su Chen was stunned.</p>
 <p>“You don’t know?” Sark was clearly a bit surprised as well before he said, “Culler is my younger brother.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen was enlightened. “So he was your younger brother. But how do you know I’m the one who killed him......”</p>
 <p>Su Chen suddenly paused and turned to look at Zhu Xianyao in disbelief. “You!?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it was me,” Zhu Xianyao said with a slight smile. “I was the one who told him that you killed his younger brother, and I was also the one who told him that you were here.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s gaze retracted slightly. “Why would you do that?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao retreated a few steps and replied, “We weren’t friends from the start. This is just a temporary alliance. But finding the time to scheme against each other a little apart from this alliance isn’t strange, is it?”</p>
 <p>“It’s not strange,” Su Chen nodded. “But you’d better not forget that if I die, no one will be able to help you find the truth anymore.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen slowly pulled out the Mountain-Beheading Blade as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“I know, but so what?” Zhu Xianyao countered as her eyebrow jumped. “Did you think that holding You Tianyang hostage, pressuring us with the threat of a greater common enemy, and baiting me with promises of recovering my memories would cause me to trust you without question? Yes, your tactics were complete and your reasoning sound. Any rational person would have gone along with you. However, the world is never rational. I, Zhu Xianyao, am a woman, and I have a temper of my own. Why should I let you lead me around by my nose?” she said as she jabbed her finger at Su Chen.</p>
 <p>Su Chen was stunned.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao continued to say incisively, “I don’t know who you are, but I know that I hate you and I hate that confidence you have as if everything’s under control...... I don’t know why I hate it so much, but I just don’t like it!”</p>
 <p>Yes, she didn’t like it!</p>
 <p>This was why Zhu Xianyao had done this. This was her reasoning!</p>
 <p>To her, that was good enough.</p>
 <p>“...... Don’t...... like...... it......” Su Chen muttered.</p>
 <p>In that instant, he remembered the Hidden Dragon Institute, the small bamboo forest, and his elation in feeling like everything was under his control.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao no longer remembered the details of those memories.</p>
 <p>However, the humiliation permeating that scene of failure was deeply etched into her heart. She detested, loathed, and instinctively disagreed with all this.</p>
 <p>Thus, even though she knew that no one would be able to fulfill the promise to her if Su Chen died and that doing this to him wouldn’t bring her any advantages, she still did it.</p>
 <p>This was a woman’s temperament.</p>
 <p>Not everything in this world was decided based off of profits and benefits.</p>
 <p>There were always a few people and a few instances in which they would do things even while knowing that they shouldn’t.</p>
 <p>Su Chen had calculated correctly for everyone except Zhu Xianyao, resulting in him falling victim to her scheme.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao said, “Then right now, let me see who you really are! I have a certain kind of feeling that...... I will recognize you!”</p>
 <p>A trace of hope flashed within her eyes.</p>
 <p>Sark said coolly, “I also want to see the true face of my brother’s killer!”</p>
 <p>A piercing glow appeared in his eyes.</p>
 <p>This glow could shatter any kind of disguising technique and prevent the opponent from maintaining their disguise. They would immediately revert to their original appearance, making this skill a natural enemy of all assassins.</p>
 <p>Su Chen felt the Origin Energy in his body suddenly surge, as if he were losing control of himself. His face began to distort as the disguise began to disappear.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao stared intently at Su Chen with her eyes wide, not blinking even once.</p>
 <p>Under Sark’s Eagle Eye, the fat figure of “You Tianyang” began to slim down, and his round face began to elongate, constantly changing. Just as her opponent’s true appearance was about to be revealed, Zhu Xianyao saw him lower his head. A mask had suddenly appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>A worthless mask in the image of a demon face.</p>
 <p>“No! You bastard!” Zhu Xianyao began to yell.</p>
 <p>Su Chen chuckled. “Sorry, I really can’t let you see what I look like. It’s better if Young Miss Zhu doesn’t see it so that I don’t scare you.”</p>
 <p>Sark’s body began to exude an intense killing intent. “Then I’ll take it off myself!”</p>
 <p>A sweeping wave of energy suddenly burst forth from his body at Su Chen as a Lotus Platform appeared on Sark’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Light Shaking!</p>
 <p>He was actually a Light Shaking Realm cultivator!</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>Just like how she had misjudged Su Chen, she discovered that she had also misjudged Sark. The guard standing behind Pall, who seemed to at most be at the peak of the Yang Opening Realm was actually a Light Shaking Realm cultivator!</p>
 <p>The slippery Pall had tricked everyone!</p>
 <p>Even Su Chen was a bit surprised. He also hadn’t expected for Sark to be a Light Shaking Realm cultivator.</p>
 <p>However, facing a Light Shaking Realm cultivator didn’t fill Su Chen with the despair that Zhu Xianyao was currently immersed in. He pulled out a few vials of medicine, drank them, then spun the Mountain-Beheading Blade in his hand. “Can we really team up now? If you still insist on acting foolishly, the end result will be both of us dying.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao replied with gritted teeth, “I wasn’t acting foolishly.”</p>
 <p>“I just asked you if we were going to team up or not!” Su Chen said.</p>
 <p>“I’ll do it!” Zhu Xianyao yelled loudly in reply.</p>
 <p>Even though she was stubborn, she wasn’t an idiot. She knew that if Sark killed Su Chen, she would also be subjected to a miserable fate.</p>
 <p>Sark laughed coldly, “Two weak chickens aren’t worth......”</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Before he could finish speaking, the Mountain-Beheading Blade expanded to a length of eighteen feet. Under the control of Su Chen’s Primordial Blood Incarnation, it swung through the air in an extremely threatening manner, the surface of the blade coated with a shadowy flame.</p>
 <p>Su Chen had immediately opened with his killing move. When facing a Light Shaking Realm cultivator, even Su Chen couldn’t hold back.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao made a move at the same time.</p>
 <p>She didn’t use the Heavenly Fox Finger. She was very clear that her cultivation base was not sufficient to unleash the power that the Heavenly Fox Finger should possess.</p>
 <p>She sang.</p>
 <p>Her clear, resonant voice rang out gracefully. Her sweet swinging was enough to move even the hardest hearts, like causing water to spring forth from rocks.</p>
 <p>She danced.</p>
 <p>Her dance was lively, graceful, and fluid, her peerless beauty enough to charm any onlooker.</p>
 <p>Strands of silky fog also began streaming through the air, forming picturesque works of art in the air.</p>
 <p>A dazzling song and dance had begun.</p>
 <p>The song was the Jade Immortal Ballad, each and every syllable plunging deep into the heart. The dance was the Heavenly Fox Dance, each movement drawing the eye in. The smoke was the Soul-Disturbing Smoke, each strand of smoke bewitching the soul.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao had also opened up with the Heavenly Fox Zhu Clan’s absolute technique.</p>
 <p>Any normal person would be instantly infatuated in just a glance, whisper, or whiff, completely losing their sense of awareness. There might even be some who would fall under her direct control, to be used as she pleased.</p>
 <p>However, Sark wasn’t just a normal person.</p>
 <p>He was a Light Shaking Realm cultivator.</p>
 <p>The Lotus Pavilion guarded his consciousness, allowing him to remain clear-headed.</p>
 <p>Even someone of the same cultivation base wouldn’t have any easy time charming him with the Heavenly Fox Dance, let alone a mere Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>Even so, Zhu Xianyao had never planned on accomplishing that.</p>
 <p>She didn’t think that she could completely bewitch Sark, but the Zhu Clan’s Heavenly Fox Dance wouldn’t be completely ineffective.</p>
 <p>If Sark didn’t want to be affected he would have to divide his attention. His focus would be distracted, his will weakened, and even his Origin Energy would have to be redirected to guard his mind.</p>
 <p>That would be enough.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao, who had exchanged blows with Su Chen personally, knew how much combat strength that man possessed.</p>
 <p>Even if her song and dance could only reduce Sark’s strength by twenty percent, with that Su Chen wouldn’t be likely to lose.</p>
