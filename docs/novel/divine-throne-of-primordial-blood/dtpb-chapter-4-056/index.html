 <p>Chapter 56: Decision</p>
 <p>Early morning.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao woke up in a daze. She rubbed her somewhat messy hair, then turned around, wanting to stay in bed a bit longer.</p>
 <p>She suddenly seemed to remember something and jerked upright, her eyes wide open, revealing the smooth, silky upper half of her body.</p>
 <p>She instinctively covered her chest and raised her head to see Su Chen standing in front of the research station, holding a flask with a contemplative look on his face.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao stared at Su Chen, in a daze. “You…… me……”</p>
 <p>“You’re awake,” Su Chen said without lifting his head.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao stammered, “Yesterday, we……”</p>
 <p>Scenes of what happened last night began to flash through her head.</p>
 <p>It was quite strange; in the heat of the moment they had both been discombobulated, but she could still clearly remember what had happened. There was no indication that her memories were chaotic or disorganized at all.</p>
 <p>Yet it was because of this that she felt even more angry and humiliated.</p>
 <p>How could she have done something like that with him?</p>
 <p>Perhaps if it was an act born from love, Zhu Xianyao wouldn’t have been angered at all upon finding out about this. Actually, she might have even felt a bit of happiness and bashfulness at the same time.</p>
 <p>Instead, there was a complicated feeling of bewilderment that stemmed from her achieving what she wanted but in a way that was all too sudden.</p>
 <p>Even Zhu Xianyao herself didn’t know what she should do anymore.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Su Chen said in a low voice. “We did what we should not have done.”</p>
 <p>It’s almost like you were the one who was wronged, Zhu Xianyao cursed silently. She couldn’t help but grow a bit angry when she saw his heavy expression, and her expression also began to sink.</p>
 <p>“How did that happen?” she asked.</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s eyes flickered as he stared at the vial of pink smoke. “It was caused by this strange smoke.”</p>
 <p>“It’s an aphrodisiac?” Zhu Xianyao was stunned.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s much more advanced than an aphrodisiac! Aphrodisiacs only amplify a person’s lust, so anyone with a strong will can resist it. However, this substance directly affects a person’s consciousness; not only does it stimulate lust but it also wipes out all rationality. Even someone at the Light Shaking or even Spirit Burning Realm might not be able to resist its influence.”</p>
 <p>“You were actually researching something like this?” Zhu Xianyao stood up angrily, then discovered that she wasn’t wearing anything and sat back down.</p>
 <p>Su Chen, however, completely paid her no mind. “I didn’t expect that the new Origin Substance would be like this either, and that the extraction would have succeeded at that point in time. Perhaps this is just how life is.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen sighed.</p>
 <p>“So you feel like you’ve suffered a great loss? Like you were totally helpless? Like you are in pain?” Zhu Xianyao stared at Su Chen, her eyes filled with rage and hatred.</p>
 <p>“Of course not. I just think that fate is so fickle sometimes……” Su Chen fell silent for a few moments, then continued. “Do you still want me to wipe your memories away?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was taken aback.</p>
 <p>At this point in time, she no longer knew what to do.</p>
 <p>After thinking about it for a long time, she stood up. Her beautiful, jade-like skin once again appeared in front of Su Chen.</p>
 <p>Even though he had already seen the wonders of Zhu Xianyao’s naked body, he was quite shocked upon seeing it again.</p>
 <p>She put on her clothes just like that in front of Su Chen, then began walking out of the room.</p>
 <p>“Wait just a moment,” Su Chen said.</p>
 <p>“What? You want another go at it?” Zhu Xianyao asked.</p>
 <p>Her tone was harsh, but in reality she was hoping for Su Chen to say yes.</p>
 <p>In other words, what she wanted most was for Su Chen to be warm towards her.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Su Chen was going to disappoint her.</p>
 <p>He handed her a vial of medicine and said, “Since this was your first time, your Qi and blood are likely in disarray and what happened last night could be easily uncovered. If you don’t want that to happen, drink this.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao took the medicine and glared fiercely at Su Chen. “That’s all you want to say? Drink this medicine and then pretend like nothing happened?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen sighed. “I know what you want to hear, but I’m sorry. I need some time to calm down and think about some things. I cannot give you any kind of promise right now, but could you give me some time?”</p>
 <p>When she saw Su Chen’s helpless expression, the flames of anger in Zhu Xianyao’s heart were suddenly snuffled.</p>
 <p>A tear rolled down her cheek. Zhu Xianyao wiped it away and said, “I’ve made my decision.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Su Chen didn’t understand.</p>
 <p>“I don’t need you to wipe my memories away anymore. No matter what you do, I will continue to be myself.” As she spoke, Zhu Xianyao put the medicine back down. “I don’t need you to help me keep things quiet. So what if I’ve lost my virginity and other people find out? The first man I have ever had is you, Su Chen; even if you don’t take me as your wife, I will not try to deny it. I won’t force you either, since everything will be my own voluntary choice. No matter who mocks or curses or humiliates me, I have made this choice without any regrets. You don’t need to feel guilty over this. If you don’t like it, then that’s fine. Since I’ve fallen for you, then I will willingly wait the rest of my life for you.”</p>
 <p>Once she had said her piece, she walked out.</p>
 <p>What the hell.</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s heart was in overwhelming turmoil.</p>
 <p>Can you not paint me out to be a merciless wastrel with your self-righteous words?</p>
 <p>Saying things like ‘If you don’t like it, then fine,’ ‘I’m willing to wait the rest of my life for you,’ ‘No matter who mocks or curses or humiliates me, I won’t regret it’ — aren’t you just trying to force my hand with underhanded tactics?</p>
 <p>But it had to be said that, in the instant Zhu Xianyao put down the medicine and walked out of that room, everybody realized what had happened.</p>
 <p>Right now, her eyes were dazzling. The reason why Night Demon had dared to sleep in his room and wasn’t afraid that anyone would laugh at her was because there were always some special after effects that would be immediately noticed.</p>
 <p>As soon as Zhu Xianyao walked out of that room without disguising herself, she was basically announcing to the whole world what had happened.</p>
 <p>In that sense, Zhu Xianyao was definitely not playing any games.</p>
 <p>For him, she would pay any price.</p>
 <p>However, this was also what drove Su Chen speechless.</p>
 <p>Holy crap, can you not be so crazy?</p>
 <p>Even so, regardless of whether he liked it or not, that was the current situation.</p>
 <p>All Su Chen could do was face it head on.</p>
 <p>After thinking about it for such a long time, Su Chen finally made up his mind.</p>
 <p>He walked out of his room and found Zhu Xianyao sitting atop a large rock. A few people would glance at her from time to time and whisper to one another. Even though it was impossible to hear what they were saying, it was pretty easy to guess.</p>
 <p>Su Chen walked over to Zhu Xianyao. “I’ve thought this matter through. Since everything happened like this, then I need to see it through. I can explain things to Qingluo; I believe she will understand.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao didn’t appear much happier after hearing what Su Chen had to say.</p>
 <p>She laughed coldly at Su Chen. “Did you think that doing this would be acceptable as an apology? Or, in other words, that a woman who has lost her chastity has nothing left? That’s why you’re taking pity on me and offering to care for me, but you still need to go back and ask your wife for forgiveness?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen was taken aback.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao said, “Su Chen, you should realize that I’m not someone whose sole value is my virginity. Do you believe that I could go right now and drag a bunch of men over who would be crying and begging to have me?”</p>
 <p>“You know that’s not what I meant.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao harrumphed. “I know what you mean, but I don’t want your pity. Also, don’t think that everything will be fine just because Gu Qingluo nods her head yes. Did you really think that you could just marry a woman from a Nobility Clan just because you want to? I am the heir of a Demonic Emperor Bloodline; I will never be married off to someone, and I will always choose who I marry, understand? And even if I did marry you, you, Su Chen, would need to become part of the Zhu Clan! As for Gu Qingluo, I would also need to agree before she can even get through the door! Of course, if she awakens her Origin Beast Bloodline, then the situation would be reversed. But before this, as someone with a Demonic Lord Beast Bloodline, she has to listen to me! You thought you could decide everything for me? No, you can’t decide anything at all!”</p>
 <p>Su Chen frowned. “I just want to take responsibility for what I did.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t need you to!” Zhu Xianyao replied harshly. “I understand now. You thought that everything I said to you earlier was to put pressure on you? You thought that I was trying to force you to do something? Su Chen, you’re totally wrong! I am not that clever; perhaps I was in the past, but I would not do something like that now. That’s because after all my experiences at the Hidden Dragon Institute I realized that the Heavens never help man; man must help himself!”</p>
 <p>She stared intently at Su Chen. “I do love you, but I don’t need your pity. If you don’t love me, then don’t force yourself. From this day onwards, you and I both have our own lives. I don’t need you to take responsibility for my future!”</p>
