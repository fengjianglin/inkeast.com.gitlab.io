 <p>Chapter 45: The Fourth Person</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Su Chen fell to the ground heavily as he spat out a mouthful of blood. At the same time, he raised his hand to cover his face.</p>
 <p>Even at this point, he didn’t want Zhu Xianyao to see his face.</p>
 <p>Sark was obviously much stronger than Shen Yuanhong. In addition to his own personal strength, he had many treasures on him.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t that surprising. Even though the Sand Race wasn’t the human race, he, as the most trusted subordinate of the Sand Race’s leader, was definitely going to be richer than Shen Yuanhong, a Bloodline Nobility Clan elder in some remote city.</p>
 <p>Su Chen wasn’t able to triumph over Sark in terms of either wealth or strength, so he could only try to clean up the situation after dealing Sark a serious blow.</p>
 <p>But no matter how helpless he felt, Sark only felt more aggrieved and angered.</p>
 <p>“You actually wounded me to this point! Dammit, dammit, dammit!” he howled madly, his head tilted at an unnatural angle as he lay in a pool of his own blood. “I won’t lose!”</p>
 <p>“Dammit, you’re still not dead yet?” He Xu cursed as he clutched at his midsection. He gestured, and a few streaks of light slammed into Sark’s body.</p>
 <p>Sark didn’t even react to that attack. He exerted all the energy in his body to raise his arm. Under his control, the river of golden sand undulating forward once again, continuing to advance at Su Chen.</p>
 <p>“Psh. You can still struggle on your deathbed?” Su Chen gestured, and a few Thunderfire Balls flew through the air.</p>
 <p>Boom, boom, boom, boom!</p>
 <p>Large swathes of flames surged forward, blasting the golden sand aside. One of them even sent Sark flying through the air.</p>
 <p>However, this opponent was quite resilient. He unleashed another palm strike directly at the lizard on the ground.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>This gentle blow reawakened the lizard from the illusory realm.</p>
 <p>“Haha, go and kill them!” Sark yelled loudly.</p>
 <p>That lizard charged towards the three of them.</p>
 <p>“NO!” Zhu Xianyao’s face revealed a desperate expression.</p>
 <p>At that exact moment, however, a low whistle suddenly sounded out from off in the distance.</p>
 <p>When it heard that whistle, the lizard immediately charged off into the darkness.</p>
 <p>Immediately afterwards, the sound of a fierce battle broke out. However, under the cover of darkness, it was impossible to tell what was going on.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Sark was stunned.</p>
 <p>“Nothing much. It’s just a friend of mine,” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>“Then isn’t he showing himself?” He Xu and Zhu Xianyao asked simultaneously.</p>
 <p>“He’s a bit wary of strangers,” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>He Xu and Zhu Xianyao glanced at each other. They obviously couldn’t figure out why Su Chen was acting so secretively.</p>
 <p>“NO!” Sark howled in despair and rage.</p>
 <p>He was just about to succeed when someone else had interfered yet again. How could he be willing to accept this situation?</p>
 <p>The anger in his heart and his serious injuries then caused him to die on the spot.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao said angrily, “You still aren’t going to lower your hand? Or are you going to cover your face forever?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen sighed and lowered his hand.</p>
 <p>An extremely common and bland face appeared.</p>
 <p>“You......” Zhu Xianyao was stunned. She had never seen this face before. It took her a moment before she realized what was going on. “You’re still disguising yourself?”</p>
 <p>Without Sark’s Eagle Eye, Su Chen could use his camouflage again.</p>
 <p>“Instead of getting upset over this, take some time to recover,” Su Chen said as he tossed out a few Recovery Medicines at Zhu Xianyao and He Xu.</p>
 <p>“Drink the red vial and pour the blue vial on your wounds,” Su Chen said.</p>
 <p>He simultaneously pulled out a vial of blue medicine and began to rub it on his arm.</p>
 <p>A decent-sized chunk of flesh had been cut off of his right arm, and a long wound covered his chest. His internal organs were threatening to burst out. However, as soon as the blue medicine came into contact with the wound, countless strands of fibrous tissue began to interlace over the wound, quickly returning it to its original state. In just a few moments, Su Chen’s broken arm had begun to fuse together again.</p>
 <p>“What kind of medicine is that?” Even Zhu Xianyao had never seen a medicine with such miraculous recovery abilities like this before.</p>
 <p>“A very expensive medicine,” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>After using the medicine, Su Chen’s wounds quickly healed to such a point that he was able to stand, but the broken bones wouldn’t be able to heal immediately. Even with the aid of the medicine, they would still take some time to fully recover.</p>
 <p>If only there was some kind of technique like Devouring the Heavens with an incredible recovery ability and no unhealthy consequences, Su Chen sighed to himself.</p>
 <p>If he had time, perhaps it would be worth researching.</p>
 <p>The commotion in the darkness was still ongoing, but it had quieted down quite a bit.</p>
 <p>The conclusion came swiftly.</p>
 <p>Not long afterwards, the commotion finally died down.</p>
 <p>The quiet footsteps sounded out again, but they seemed to be disappearing off into the distance.</p>
 <p>When Su Chen, He Xu, and Zhu Xianyao found the other battleground, they could only find the lizard’s corpse. Its opponent had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>They came silently.</p>
 <p>They left silently.</p>
 <p>He Xu and Zhu Xianyao were a bit stunned.</p>
 <p>It was Su Chen who said, “This place is about to collapse. You guys should go and dig out those precious stones while you still have time.”</p>
 <p>He Xu and Zhu Xianyao snapped out of it and hurried to the tunnel to try and mine the precious stones. Su Chen, on the other hand, returned to retrieving the remaining secret items in the space and using some medicines on Sark.</p>
 <p>A Light Shaking Realm cultivator was truly rare.</p>
 <p>To Su Chen, this guy was a great experimental material.</p>
 <p>The two of them came to the tunnel lined with precious stones.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao said as she tugged at the stones, “These stones won’t belong to me anyways. Why should I help you harvest them?”</p>
 <p>“Because you were the one who lured that bastard over here and wasted our time. Also, I was imprisoned by you for a month, woman. If it weren’t to give Su...... face, I definitely wouldn’t let you get away with it!”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s hand froze. “To give who face?”</p>
 <p>“Ah? I said...... to give my friend face,” He Xu replied.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s expression fell. “No, you didn’t say friends earlier.”</p>
 <p>He Xu chuckled nervously. “You really are always suspicious. Perhaps you just heard me incorrectly?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s expression grew dark. “You just said the word ‘Su’...... this guy’s surname is Su, is it not?”</p>
 <p>He Xu licked his lips nervously. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Su? What Su? I think you heard incorrectly.”</p>
 <p>“You’re lying!”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s voice suddenly grew shrill and her eyes were filled with anger.</p>
 <p>He Xu cried out in panic silently.</p>
 <p>He had forgotten that this damned woman could tell if he was lying or not.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao advanced on He Xu. “Why would you lie? Why would you deny it? So what if his surname is Su? Why can’t you tell me...... Oh my God.”</p>
 <p>Her expression had totally changed by the time she stopped speaking.</p>
 <p>She stared at He Xu. “He’s Su Chen, isn’t he?”</p>
 <p>He Xu swallowed with great difficulty. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
 <p>“You’re lying!” Zhu Xianyao continued.</p>
 <p>She turned around and saw Su Chen walking out of the dark room with Sark’s body in hand.</p>
 <p>He had finally taken care of everything in the room.</p>
 <p>When he saw Zhu Xianyao and He Xu standing next to each other, Su Chen was a bit surprised. He instinctively asked, “What are you guys doing?”</p>
 <p>“Su Chen!” Zhu Xianyao said.</p>
 <p>Su Chen froze.</p>
 <p>At that moment, time seemed to freeze as the three of them stood there.</p>
 <p>Su Chen remained motionless.</p>
