 <p>Chapter 61: Farewell</p>
 <p>Even Su Chen didn’t expect that this to turn into an ordeal lasting longer than half a year.</p>
 <p>During this half-year, Zhu Xianyao and Su Chen had acted just like husband and wife, appearing together in public all the time and enjoying each others’ company.</p>
 <p>Zhu Baiyu had no objections in the slightest — when he relayed this matter to the Zhu Clan, the Zhu Clan was about to go crazy.</p>
 <p>It was a craziness that stemmed from happiness.</p>
 <p>Strengthening the power of their bloodline was something that every clan dreamed of achieving. Its actual value far exceeded that of a technique for reaching the Blood Boiling Realm without a bloodline — at least to the Zhu Clan. After all, the latter could only produce a few low-level cultivators and increase their potential slightly, while the former could increase the strength of the whole clan.</p>
 <p>Su Chen was giving the Zhu Clan the ability to increase the strength of their control techniques. This kind of improvement was almost unprecedented when it came to bewitching techniques.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Race could enslave people stronger than them because they targeted their opponents’ consciousnesses. However, they could only control individuals whose consciousness power was weaker than their own.</p>
 <p>Liaoye’s Imperial Family, the Dream Dragon Li Clan, could control individuals stronger than them, but they couldn’t do it in battle. They could do so after sneaking into their opponents’ dreams.</p>
 <p>Small clans like the Bewitching Butterfly Jin Clan or the Stonetable Spider Demon Zhou Clan weren’t even worth mentioning. They had to be selective about their targets even when at the same cultivation base and could only control targets weaker than them. They couldn’t even dream of daring to leap cultivation bases.</p>
 <p>It could be said that controlling someone stronger than you was an incredible leap. Any clan that specialized in bewitching techniques would thirst badly for such an ability. As for losing three years of cultivation, that wasn’t important. If they had as much money as Su Chen, they could recover that in no time.</p>
 <p>Because of this, the Zhu Clan agreed to every one of Su Chen’s conditions. When Zhu Baiyu said that Zhu Xianyao wanted to stay behind to help Su Chen continue his research of their bloodline, the Zhu Clan indicated that they had no objections.</p>
 <p>In reality, they were already incredibly satisfied with Su Chen’s progress — even without the bloodline, the medicine was quite good. Even if they required medicine to control someone stronger than them, they could still control the enemy. As long as they grew stronger, who cared about the method? As long as he was willing to hand the recipe over to them and keep it private, they would agree.</p>
 <p>It was still private.</p>
 <p>Half a year later, Su Chen finally completed his improvement of Zhu Xianyao’s bloodline.</p>
 <p>It was an increase on the most fundamental level. From this day onwards, Zhu Xianyao would be able to control people stronger than her, and her sons and daughters would also be able to inherit her bloodline and this power.</p>
 <p>“From today onwards, you are the progenitor of the Zhu Clan’s new bloodline,” Su Chen proclaimed after a long and passionate ‘battle.’</p>
 <p>A naked Zhu Xianyao lay in Su Chen’s embrace as she said, “So this day still came arrived in the end, huh? We’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time, but now that it’s here I just feel reluctant.”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Su Chen agreed.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao gazed at him happily. “So you’re not willing to leave me either, right? Why don’t you just come back with me to the Zhu Clan? With your ability, giving you control over the Zhu Clan in the future wouldn’t be that big of a deal.”</p>
 <p>“You know that’s not what I’m after. Also......” Su Chen’s voice trailed off.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s expression dimmed slightly as she leaned against Su Chen. “You still miss her.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen didn’t reply.</p>
 <p>There was no need to reply to some topics.</p>
 <p>As such, Zhu Xianyao continued, “Alright, then I will agree to marry into the Su Clan from today onwards. I don’t care whether Gu Qingluo agrees or not. Also, even though you two fell in love first, your first time was with me, so I want to be equal in status to her, and not just a concubine. Finally, of the children I bear you, one of them must be surnamed Zhu......”</p>
 <p>A large list of conditions came pouring out.</p>
 <p>Su Chen could only laugh bitterly.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Time flew away.</p>
 <p>Another half month passed by in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>Even though she was unwilling to part with him and even though she had done her best to delay, that inevitable day of separation came.</p>
 <p>On the day of their separation, Zhu Xianyao wept profusely.</p>
 <p>She clung onto Su Chen’s hand and said, “You will definitely come find me and ask for my hand, right?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen nodded confidently. “I will. This is the 1872nd time you’ve asked this, Young Miss. No matter what, I will get her to agree, and then come and ask for your hand. You belong to me, Su Chen, and I won’t allow you to be with anyone else. So wait for me obediently back in the Zhu Clan!”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao laughed at his statement as Zhu Baiyu and Zhao Jingwen dragged her back to the carriage under You Tianyang’s sorrowful gaze.</p>
 <p>The clopping of hooves grew faint as they disappeared into the distance.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao had left, along with a part of Su Chen’s heart.</p>
 <p>Feelings usually took time to foster. The former Su Chen could confidently say that he didn’t love Zhu Xianyao.</p>
 <p>The current Su Chen, however, could not say the same.</p>
 <p>No matter; it was now time to find Gu Qingluo.</p>
 <p>There were some things that needed to be explained to her. Hopefully she would be able to accept it.</p>
 <p>As Su Chen was deep in thought, he suddenly heard a voice from behind him. “What? You aren’t willing to let go of her?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen was given quite a bad shock. He turned around and saw Yue Longsha behind him.</p>
 <p>“Where did you come from? Have you been watching me these past few days?” Su Chen asked, still surprised.</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha rolled her eyes at him. “I’m not interested in watching you. However, you have Pall in your hands, so I wanted to ask if he was still alive. In the end, he still is the leader of the Sand Race and has some value. I wasn’t expecting to run into this though.”</p>
 <p>“Then you should have come a bit earlier. I lost track of time while I was doing research last month and ended up killing him.” Su Chen shrugged.</p>
 <p>“Oh, then forget about it. I just happened to pass by and wanted to ask about it,” Yue Longsha replied carelessly. No matter how you looked at the situation, it didn’t seem like she had come for Pall at all.</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha said, “Oh, by the way, how did you and Zhu Xianyao get so cozy with one another? What about Gu Qingluo?”</p>
 <p>Her question seemed innocent, but Su Chen felt a different vibe.</p>
 <p>However, he still told her everything that had happened between him and Zhu Xianyao. In the end, he sighed, “I never would have expected that matters would reach this point. You could say that one wrong step led to many in a row.”</p>
 <p>“You looked like you were pretty reluctant to leave her back there. It sure doesn’t seem like you took that many wrong steps in a row.”</p>
 <p>Su Chen said with some shame, “I’m just making the best out of a bad situation.”</p>
 <p>When Yue Longsha heard this, she asked, “So, Su Chen, have you already given up on being faithful to Gu Qingluo until the day you die?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen sighed. “I always thought that even though there were lots of pretty girls in this world, I would only ever love her. I didn’t expect things to develop into this. Thus, I have no choice but to give up being faithful to her forever. I hope that she can understand.”</p>
 <p>“But what if she doesn’t understand? Will you give up on Zhu Xianyao?” Yue Longsha asked.</p>
 <p>Su Chen fell silent for some time, then shook his head and said, “I won’t. Since things have reached this point, there’s no turning back. If I turn back now, I’m not a man. No matter what, I must be responsible for Zhu Xianyao until the end.”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha smiled. “You didn’t disappoint me.”</p>
 <p>“Hm? What does that mean?”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha said casually, “When it comes to love, you’re either single-minded or you’re promiscuous. Once you’ve made your decision, you don’t regret it, nor do you waffle back and forth incessantly. Su Chen, you aren’t going to be able to cling onto just Gu Qingluo anymore — remember that. Your backyard is now open; perhaps in the future there will be one or two more there as well.”</p>
 <p>Hm?</p>
 <p>Su Chen was stunned.</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha said, “I’m talking about Night Demon. Don’t you think that the girl likes you a lot too?”</p>
 <p>“She’s still too simple-minded about these kinds of things and wouldn’t understand it.”</p>
 <p>“But even the youngest girl will still eventually grow up. One day she’ll understand these things.”</p>
 <p>“Why do you care about these things? Do you want to be in my backyard as well?”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha blushed fiercely and said, “So improper. I still have business to take care of and won’t take up too much more of your time, so I’ll leave first.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she began to leave.</p>
 <p>Su Chen seemed to think of something as he stared at her. He called out, “You didn’t come here for Pall, did you?”</p>
 <p>Yue Longsha stopped in her tracks, then waved goodbye at Su Chen without turning around, disappearing amongst the crowd of onlookers.</p>
 <p>Translator’s notes:</p>
 <p>I know many of you hate harem. One thing I will say is that harem has been well-established in this universe. Su Chen’s dad also had multiple wives. Does this development suck? Maybe, depending on what you think of it. Despite the fact that I am not the biggest fan of it, I think the author is justified in including it given that it has already been established and not just because Su Chen is a horndog (though of course that plays a large part). If you’re turned off by this and choose not to read any further, thanks for sticking around and I greatly, greatly appreciate your support!</p>
