 <p>Chapter 59: Medicine</p>
 <p>To the people living in West River Village, this herbal medicine was their defender, allowing them to avoid the curse; however, it was also their jailor, firmly locking them here and not letting them leave.</p>
 <p>Su Chen’s words, however, would open up completely new possibilities. They would be able to escape from their shackles and fly free from their cages to explore the broad, vast seas.</p>
 <p>However, if anyone thought that this would make them willing to leave, they would be gravely mistaken.</p>
 <p>Habit was an extremely powerful force!</p>
 <p>They had grown accustomed to living on this piece of earth for generations, making it hard for the people living here to part with it. Many people would rather die than leave the place that had supported them for generations.</p>
 <p>The difficult feeling of leaving one’s homeland behind was difficult for outsiders to understand.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Su Chen didn’t intend for them to leave completely. Rather, he was just asking them to hide temporarily when the ten Bloodline Nobility Clans came. There wasn’t many problems with that.</p>
 <p>That evening, the people from Happiness Residing Fort arranged a massive banquet, celebrating their freedom. They sang and danced cheerfully.</p>
 <p>However, within the room belonging to the chief, Su Chen had sunk into a deep sleep. Iron Cliff stood guard at the door, blocking anyone from trying to get in. This meant that Su Chen had already entered the Dreamrealm - after the training session that year, Su Chen now knew the importance of establishing a secure environment before entering the Dreamrealm.</p>
 <p>When he entered, he was greeted by a familiar castle.</p>
 <p>Every user of the Dreamrealm would appear in their starting location unless they wanted to change it. But even if they did change it, they wouldn’t see anything new; after all, the Dreamrealm was just an information and communications network. There weren’t any magnificent landscapes to be found. The scenery was the same everywhere, and even the multicolored, brilliant lights would become of no importance very quickly.</p>
 <p>Su Chen didn’t go to the busiest three Main Exchange Halls. Instead, he walked up the stairs to the Dreamcastle and found a small peaceful alleyway. He opened one of the doors and walked in. He was greeted by a small building in a quiet, secluded area surrounded by lush mountains and clear water.</p>
 <p>This was Su Chen’s residence within the Dreamrealm Castle, and it was one of the benefits of becoming a Dream Officer. Because it was his own place, Su Chen could design it as he pleased. Evidently, Su Chen seemed to have the personality traits of a hermit.</p>
 <p>The Dreamrealm’s residences could create a secure environment for their owners to discuss things. According to the Lord of the Dreamrealm, this was the highest privilege obtainable; not even he could listen in on those conversations. Whether or not that was true, it was hard to say since he controlled these matters all on his own. At the very least, however, no one with the privilege of a Dream King could break into another person’s residence.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Continent didn’t have many quick ways to communicate. The Dreamrealm was the fastest and most convenient way to communicate with someone.</p>
 <p>Upon entering his own residence, Su Chen said, “Open the communications line and call Instructor.”</p>
 <p>An invisible ripple was sent out.</p>
 <p>Not long after, a person appeared. It was Shi Kaihuang.</p>
 <p>“Instructor!”</p>
 <p>“Oh hoh!” Shi Kaihuang gazed happily at his pleased disciple. “You haven’t come for a while. What have you been busy with lately?”</p>
 <p>“Your disciple went to West River Forest to temper myself.” Su Chen began to explain what had happened during this period of time.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, those Bloodline Nobility Clans want to bleed the poor people dry. They’re all incredibly greedy. Occurrences like this are all too common. It’s time to teach them a good lesson,” Shi Kaihuang harrumphed. “Don’t worry. No matter what consequences there are, I will help shield you from them.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, your disciple understands. My greatest backer until now wasn’t the Shadow Servants or medicines; it was Instructor!” Su Chen replied.</p>
 <p>Shi Kaihuang laughed, “All you know how to do is flatter people.”</p>
 <p>Even though he knew he was being flattered, it made him quite happy to hear it. In addition, this flattery wasn’t fake.</p>
 <p>Without Shi Kaihuang as Su Chen’s staunch backer, Su Chen would need to weigh his actions a lot more carefully.</p>
 <p>“Right, Instructor, how goes the research on breaking into the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline?”</p>
 <p>“The more progress we make, the harder it gets!” Shi Kaihuang shook his head and sighed.</p>
 <p>“Are you still stuck at the Three Yangs Intersection?”</p>
 <p>“I’m still stuck there and haven’t been able to progress. The Three Yangs Intersection is where Origin Energy comes together. If there are any mistakes, a person’s blood flow will be thrown into chaos. I’m going the Origin Opening route; even though it can stabilize a person’s blood flow to a certain degree, I can’t maintain complete control over it. You also know that if an accident happens here, the consequences would be disastrous. At the very least, one will fail to break through and experience an Origin Energy backlash, but at worst it could take a person’s life.”</p>
 <p>“This is the reason why I came looking for Instructor today. I made a discovery while in the West River Forest. Perhaps it might be able to resolve the issue of the Three Yangs Intersection.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? What is it?” Upon hearing this, Shi Kaihuang’s interest was piqued.</p>
 <p>“It’s the West River Forest curse,” Su Chen replied. “The origin of this curse is actually an extremely small microorganism. Your disciple has been studying them recently and unintentionally discovered that these organisms are extremely helpful to the Three Yangs Intersection; they can stabilize a person’s blood flow and unblock Origin Energy flow. If you can incorporate them into a medicine, it can resolve the issue of the Three Yangs Intersection.”</p>
 <p>When he heard this, Shi Kaihuang immediately shook his head. “What I need is a way to reach the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline or medicine. If you rely on medicinal power to obtain success, you will be restricted by the medicine. What is the difference between that and being restricted by a bloodline, then?”</p>
 <p>“There’s a big difference,” Su Chen laughed. “Medicine is much easier to obtain than a bloodline, and everyone will have the same opportunity. Developing a way to reach the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline is going to take a long time. Instructor should first focus on dealing with the problems in front of you rather than trying to pursue a perfect method from the very beginning.”</p>
 <p>Shi Kaihuang was stunned.</p>
 <p>He thought for a moment, then said, “That makes a bit of sense. But since this kind of medicine relies on ingredients only found in West River Forest, the amount we can produce every year is limited right?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. Therefore, your disciple intends to focus on improving it after we’ve dealt with reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline. Wasn’t the method for reaching the Blood Boiling Realm without a bloodline built on the work of many others before us?”</p>
 <p>“That...... is actually not wrong.” Shi Kaihuang nodded.</p>
 <p>He then sighed, “That year, you were the one who came up with the method of combining Ancient Arcana Techniques and contemporary Origin Skills, completing the method for reaching the Blood Boiling Realm. Now, we need to add in medicine to reach the Yang Opening Realm. At the very least, in terms of your train of thought, you have greatly surpassed me!”</p>
 <p>“But everything is still because of Instructor. I was just adding flowers to a brocade[1. Making things more beautiful.], is all.”</p>
 <p>“Adding flowers to a brocade? It’s more like adding on the final finishing touches. If your medicine can really resolve the Three Yangs Intersection issue, then it’s just a matter of time before we complete a way to reach the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline. Oh, you’re probably waiting for this as well, right?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Instructor,” Su Chen replied with a slight smile.</p>
 <p>Shi Kaihuang could sense Su Chen’s absurd cultivation speed.</p>
 <p>Even though they were in the Dreamrealm, Shi Kaihuang could sense that Su Chen’s cultivation base had greatly increased from when they had last encountered each other.</p>
 <p>However, every person had their own secrets. Since Su Chen didn’t say anything, he wouldn’t ask. They had a tacit understanding in this regard.</p>
 <p>To Su Chen, this kind of medicine not only represented a way to reach the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline but also an incredible haul of resources.</p>
 <p>The technique for reaching the Yang Opening Realm without a bloodline could be made public, while the recipe for the medicine would be sold by himself.</p>
 <p>After an in-depth discussion about the technique to break into the Yang Opening Realm, Shi Kaihuang asked, “Is there anything else?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen hesitated for a moment, then said, “I made a new discovery in West River Forest. There’s a kind of Purple Colored Glass there that can transfer a person’s soul and will into a Vicious Beast’s body, allowing the person to control a Vicious Beast. When taking into account the Li Residence and the matter with Wei Liancheng, we can basically confirm......”</p>
 <p>When he heard this, Shi Kaihuang’s expression sank. “So it is that group of neither human nor demonic individuals? They’ve come to our world again to stir up trouble!”</p>
 <p>“It’s because they have such low numbers,” Su Chen laughed. “If you want to do experiments, you need to go to a place where there are enough research targets.”</p>
 <p>“This won’t do. We have a serious matter in our hands; I’ll need to inform the higher-ups.”</p>
 <p>“Instructor!” Su Chen got Shi Kaihuang’s attention.</p>
 <p>He said, “Why not leave it to me?”</p>
 <p>“You?” Shi Kaihuang hesitated for a moment. “It’s not that I am looking down on you; it’s just that your opponent this time isn’t normal! You...... can you do it?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen didn’t immediately answer. He thought seriously for a moment, then replied, “I might not be able to take care of that guy right now, but with enough time, I’m confident that I’ll be able to.”</p>
 <p>Shi Kaihuang nodded. “It seems like the situation over there is quite complex. You have to deal with the ten Bloodline Nobility Clans as well as those guys. It might be hard for you to handle it on your own. How about I send some helpers over?”</p>
 <p>“Helpers? What helpers?”</p>
 <p>“The fellow students who were with you in Gold Water Ruins. How does that sound?”</p>
