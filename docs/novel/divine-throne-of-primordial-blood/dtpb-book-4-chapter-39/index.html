 <p>Chapter 39: Collision</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Pall’s face revealed a trace of impatience as he crushed the glazed clay bowl that just would not shut up. “I’m getting tired of these unkillable bastards. Where is the thing I want?”</p>
 <p>“They should be right ahead,” Eagle Eye Salk replied.</p>
 <p>A small vortex of sand spun through the air, turning into a golden arrow that pointed straight forward.</p>
 <p>If it weren’t for the fact that all kinds of strange objects were jumping out from time to time and stopping them from advancing, perhaps they would have already arrived.</p>
 <p>“Then hurry up!” Pall strode forward with large steps.</p>
 <p>A candle suddenly jumped out of nowhere. “Don’t think about taking away anything in here!”</p>
 <p>Pall rolled his eyes. “Oh, dammit all. You were my favorite silver candle; are you also going to oppose me?”</p>
 <p>The silver candle wiggled its body. “That’s not strange at all, because the blood of the old Leader that you honored and respected has dyed my body. After you stuffed me down his throat, I touched with his enraged blood, turning me into the flames of hatred that have waited for you until this moment.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” A few of the Sand Race troops stared at the candle in shock.</p>
 <p>“Ah, dammit!” Pall smacked his forehead. “I should have melted you down.”</p>
 <p>“If I were made of gold, then you probably would have done so already,” the candle replied.</p>
 <p>One of the guards stared at Pall angrily. “You said that the old Leader was killed by humans.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, that’s exactly what I said, just like how you said that you will always be loyal to me,” Pall barked back impatiently.</p>
 <p>That guard shook his head.</p>
 <p>He looked a bit confused, as if he were unsure what to do. He could only retreat one step at a time.</p>
 <p>Perhaps that was his way of compromising.</p>
 <p>However, Pall was obviously dissatisfied by this.</p>
 <p>“You shouldn’t have tried to hold onto both things. Giving up your loyalty is the same as betrayal.” Pall reached out with his hand.</p>
 <p>His movements were not fast, but that simple motion of his caused the guard to fly into his hands.</p>
 <p>He grabbed the guard by the throat and said, “I once appreciated you, but you were too stupid in the end.”</p>
 <p>He clenched his fist, crushing the guard’s throat instantaneously.</p>
 <p>“Oh!” the candle yelled as it covered its eyes. “That’s too brutal!”</p>
 <p>“What’s brutal is what has yet to come,” Pall said as he picked up the candle, then caused it to explode in his grip.</p>
 <p>However, the silver candle quickly reappeared.</p>
 <p>It floated through the air. “You can’t kill me!”</p>
 <p>“I can. Once I leave this place, I will burn everything here to a crisp. Every inanimate object here will turn to dust!” Pall coldly harrumphed.</p>
 <p>“NO!” a piercing howl resounded throughout the castle.</p>
 <p>Candles, brooms, grandfather clocks, pianos, dishes, cutlery, and teacups all came charging out at Pall.</p>
 <p>Even though they were quickly destroyed, their ability to regenerate made Pall feel quite frustrated.</p>
 <p>“Get out of my way, you damn pieces of rubbish!” Pall yelled impatiently. A large wave of sand suddenly burst forth in front of him. Any rubbish that got near him was instantly crushed into fine powder.</p>
 <p>This frightening sandstorm refused to die down, and those projection lifeforms had no way of getting close to him.</p>
 <p>As such, he continued to boldly advance in the direction that Eagle Eye had pointed. They were making so much noise that it was impossible for them to launch a sneak attack anymore.</p>
 <p>As such, when he came to the foot of the upper hallway and saw Shi Mingfeng and Zhu Baiyu standing together, even he felt like that wasn’t anything strange.</p>
 <p>He said, “I originally wanted to give you a surprise, but those pieces of rubbish delayed me for too long. They’re really quite annoying.”</p>
 <p>Shi Mingfeng laughed, “I think they actually helped you a bit…… we were planning on giving you a counter-surprise.”</p>
 <p>Pall squinted his eyes. “From what you said, it sounds like you guys knew that I was going to come?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Baiyu harrumphed, “That shouldn’t be surprising. No one is an idiot.”</p>
 <p>Pall’s expression hardened as a formless anger began to emanate from him. “But you treated me like an idiot, right? Even going so far as to rely on such lowly tactics to try and trick me.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao laughed coldly. “If it weren’t for the fact that you were tricked by a few bastards before, those tactics would have been perfect for dealing with someone like you.”</p>
 <p>“RRRAGHH!” Pall howled loudly.</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao’s words had successfully infuriated him. As if his anger was his source of energy, the vortex of sand swirling around him grew even more violent and turbulent as it began to expand towards the people in front of him.</p>
 <p>Shi Mingfeng raised his hand. A gentle breeze blew through the air as raindrops began to fall. At the same time, Zhu Baiyu moved as well. A blood-colored glow began to emanate from his body, intertwining with the sleek drops of rain and forcing the advance of a sandstorm to a halt.</p>
 <p>Pall’s strength was obvious at this point. Even though he was against two people at once, of which one possessed a Demonic Emperor Bloodline, Pall wasn’t disadvantaged in the slightest.</p>
 <p>The violent sandstorm surged recklessly, evenly matched with the combined attacks of its two opponents. Wherever the wind blew, all objects were torn to shreds, regardless of whether they were the lifeforms that could talk or the castle itself. They were all destroyed before regenerating over and over again. A large part of the Void Projection was subjected to this cycle of creation and destruction.</p>
 <p>However, Demonic Emperor Bloodlines were still Demonic Emperor Bloodlines in the end. If the battled continued in this direction, Pall would not have a chance of beating the two of them together.</p>
 <p>The problem was that he wasn’t the only Light Shaking Cultivator amongst all of the Sand Race members present.</p>
 <p>Just as the three of them were locked in a fierce standoff, another Sand Race guard attacked. He was also a Light Shaking Realm cultivator. The combined assault of the two Light Shaking Realm Sand Race individuals caused the sandstorm to grow even more violent, subjecting Zhu Baiyu and Shi Mingfeng to an intense pressure.</p>
 <p>When they saw this scene, Ba Lieyuan, Zhao Jingwen, and the others also made their moves, as did the rest of the Sand Race guards.</p>
 <p>Battles were always like this. As soon as it started, the number of people participating in the battle and the intensity of the battle would both ramp up until everyone was involved, and would only end once a victor was crowned.</p>
 <p>Su Chen, however, wasn’t planning on joining the battle.</p>
 <p>Once the battle began, Su Chen immediately began to retreat.</p>
 <p>“Where are you going? Are you trying to escape without even fighting?” Zhu Xianyao demanded as she walked over.</p>
 <p>Her attention had never left Su Chen from the very beginning.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to look for Kapius’s secret stores, of course,” Su Chen said as he headed off in another direction.</p>
 <p>“You’re going to leave behind your people and go and search for the secret stores yourself?” Zhu Xianyao said in shock as she followed closely behind.</p>
 <p>“That’s right,” Su Chen replied in a self-justified manner as he walked. “That’s nothing to be surprised over. This was our goal in the first place. Whether we win or lose the battle isn’t that important; the important thing is whether or not we achieve our goal. We are not here to kill Pall but to obtain the secret stores. If we don’t get that, then there’s no point even if we beat Pall. On the other hand, as long as we can get our hands on those secret stores, we’ll be winners even if we lose to Pall.”</p>
 <p>“You make it sound so good, but all you’re trying to do is cover up your personal greed!” Zhu Xianyao said loudly.</p>
 <p>“Actually, it’s exactly the opposite. This was something Shi Mingfeng and I had discussed since a long time ago. You can go right now and tell him that I’m leaving to go look for the secret stores and he won’t make any effort to stop me. He might not, but Pall will probably come and try.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Xianyao was stunned. “How could that be? Is he not worried that you’ll take all of the benefits for yourself?”</p>
 <p>Su Chen laughed. “Of course not. Out of everyone here, the only person he can trust is most likely me.”</p>
