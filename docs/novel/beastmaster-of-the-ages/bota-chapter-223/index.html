 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, at the Yuwen household on Fengtian Mountain, fog blanketed a large waterway, obscuring everything in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, a giant beast's roar could be heard shaking the surroundings and causing half the lifebound beasts on the mountain to shudder in fear. The terrifying roaring lasted for a few days without stopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up on a cliff in the clouds stood a young man in black. His black hair and robe gently swayed in the air, making him seem like a deity descended from the heavens. There was a slight sheen on his skin and thousands of sparkles coming from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was so handsome his angular features almost seemed sculpted. Though his outer appearance seemed a little normal on first glance, the glow that emanated from his eyes was shockingly charming. His fluttering hair and sharp eyebrows might cause someone who wasn’t on their guard to freeze in their tracks. His tall nose and thick, luscious red lips formed an enchanting smile as he looked down into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was waiting for someone. At that moment, a bear-like person two meters in height walked up to him from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth turned around and nodded, smiling. "Third Uncle."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How's it going?" the bald man asked, standing nervously at the edge of the cliff and looking down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Grandfather and Father are busy, but I believe it's almost done," he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Congratulations! You're the first ever prime disciple to have a fourth-order saint beast before the age of twenty!" the bald man said<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; float: none; display: inline !important">&nbsp;passionately</span> .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man merely laughed. "What about Shengcheng? He said he wanted to see my fourth-order saint beast. Why isn't he here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He got pissed off at the Imperial Ninefold Gates and left for the Abyssal Battlefield with his group of beauties."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Abyssal Battlefield is chaotic... who knows what kind of dirty antics he’s up to over there with those beauties."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bald man merely chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How did he get angered?" the young man asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuwen Kaitai recounted the events of that day to him, but got little response from the youth. "Oh? I was expecting more of a reaction from you. That's a pentabane, you know," he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh." He merely looked toward the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Third Uncle, my enemy is an elysian child. From now on, I won't concern myself too much with those in the Grand-Orient Sect. Let Shengcheng handle trivial matters like this himself. He needs to experience hardship."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bald man looked into the eyes of the young man. He knew that the kid he had watched grow up was now beyond them. There was nobody else in the sect that piqued his interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shengcheng is getting older now, so he does need some training and hardship. Big Brother already prepared a manna that can let his lifebound beast evolve into a second-order saint beast. In a few years, the sect will count on him. As for you... your battlefield is now the whole of the Grand-Orient Realm!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth kept silent, letting the strong winds ruffle his robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no bottomless pit into the Abyssal Battlefield in Fatepath Peak. Usually, when Qingyu wanted to go there, she would head to Azure Immortal Mountain. As the battlefield was watched over by the Grand-Orient guardians, the disciples could only enter it through the bottomless pit at Azure Immortal Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn't take long for the three of them to reach the foot of the mountain where the pit was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"With the Grand-Orient Mountains in the Abyssal Battlefield at the center, there’s four domains stretching north, south, east, and west, respectively. They’re the Grandpeace Domain, Skyhang Domain, Bladeriver Domain, and the Desolate Domain," Qingyu briefed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Where is manna most likely to show up?" Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Grandpeace, perhaps. There’s many wildbeasts and treasures there. But normal disciples wouldn't dare head that way. I've only been there with a dozen other members of the Wuyou Faction.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go to Grandpeace then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from manna, Tianming wanted to try his luck and see if he could hunt and kill a few wildbeasts to gain some spiritsource abilities for Ying Huo and Meow Meow. Even though the souls of wildbeasts couldn't unlock their bloodline abilities, he would still try his luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Qingyu and he had just broken through, they would be roughly equally powerful with Feiling out of the equation. Currently, the siblings had no other goal than to cultivate and grow even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had arrived at Azure Immortal Mountain and saw the bottomless pit. There were a few buildings from the sect nearby that were used as outposts of the sect to react to emergency situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The wildbeasts in the Abyssal Battlefield are far stronger than you can imagine. A few waves of beasts had once broken through the Hall of Hunters' defenses and even came through the bottomless pit to the Flameyellow Continent. They caused quite a lot of damage to our sect, especially during the past hundred years when the beasts numbered even more. There are two ways disciples of the sect can be rewarded. The first is to fulfill missions given by the sect, which requires going on an assignment outside the sect and being rewarded with merit points that can be exchanged for cultivation resources, such as spirit ores, herbs, hazards, beastial weapons, and battle arts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The second method is to kill wildbeasts at the Abyssal Battlefield and trade trophies from the beasts' carcasses as proof for merit points. On the sacred mountain is the Orient Hall where they inspect the trophies. You can trade the trophies for spirit gems there. You can spend the spirit gems for cultivation resources at the Grand Hall; they sell things much cheaper than other places there, but only inner disciples of the sect may use it. Outer disciples aren't afforded that luxury."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming got to know much about the Grand-Orient Sect, thanks to her explanation. Basically, disciples of the sect had to serve it for more avenues of progress in their cultivation, whether it be fulfilling direct missions or hunting wildbeasts. It was a win-win for the sect and the disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Had it not been for the fact that he had access to Li Shenxiao's tombstone, he would have to use these methods to obtain cultivation resources. At the very least, he still didn't have a unity-ranked battle art of his own, so he decided he would try earning one. Not to mention, the sect missions and hunts could also help him improve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he was the junior sect master, he was really poor and had nothing else apart from his two weapons. As for Jingyu's assets, she had spent much of it to nurture Qingyu without leaving much for Tianming. Li Wudi, on the other hand, had nothing but alcohol. Tianming was prepared to sustain his new household through honest work, if he had to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right as he and Qingyu were about to step into the pit, a group of people emerged from it. Immediately, Tianming set eyes on Ye Ziyi, who hadn’t had anything good to say about him during Ye Shaoqing's lecture two days ago. Apart from her, Li Linghe and some ten other young girls were also there. Tianming even spotted Li Chiling and Li Chenlei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all disciples of Azure Immortal Mountain. Ye Ziyi, as Elder Ye's granddaughter, was the leader of the group. She recalled that she had vowed to make him pay, and now was her chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't think you can run," she said as her minions surrounded Tianming and Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why would you go to such lengths?" Tianming hadn't done much to her, yet she was so hostile toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean 'why'? You offended me last time. Now that my uncle isn't here, you're cowering away? Well, if you want to back down, kowtow to me and I'll let you go," she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right!" Li Linghe cheered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We don't owe each other anything, nor do we have grudges. Why bother going so far?" Tianming really didn't know what those feisty young kids were thinking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's nothing much. I just want to see if a so-called pentabane like you is really a genius, or if you're just roadside trash." It seemed she still hadn't heard about Tianming breaking through at the ninth gate, something that had even shocked Yuwen Shengcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ye Ziyi, don't go overboard. We have never wronged you," Qingyu spat. It was one thing for her to go after Qingyu, but it made no sense for her to demand that Tianming prostrate himself to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Never wronged me? Li Qingyu, I simply want to mess with you. Unhappy? Then do something about it. Let's see if you'll still be my second uncle's disciple. What's with all the hype about the Li Saint Clan's Apex Branch? You guys are laughingstocks, just like the junior sect master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming sighed at the ridiculousness of the situation. Like Yuwen Shengcheng, Ye Ziyi was at fifth-level Unity. She had suppressed Qingyu back then, thanks to her one level advantage, and Li Chenlei and Li Chiling obediently followed her around. Nothing she did really escalated as Qingyu quietly endured their torment over the years. After all, her grandmother had told her that they had to count on Elder Ye, so risking his support by offending his granddaughter wasn’t something she could afford.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet that had merely exacerbated the bullying over the course of the years. Tianming could tell that Qingyu held lots of pent-up resentment. Just because she was from the Apex Branch and didn't suck up to Ye Ziyi, she was targeted. Even the most saintly person had a temper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Well, do you want to give it a try?" Tianming asked Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I’ve never defeated her before," she said with her head down. Ye Ziyi had been taught by the elder since childhood, not to mention the tons of resources she easily got. She was also a few months Qingyu's senior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It might be different this time." Tianming smirked. After all, the two girls were now at the same level, and Qingyu had even awakened her latent potential. She was no longer the bullied girl she was before. More importantly, Tianming grabbed her hand and transferred Feiling to her. Even with a synchronization rate of only sixty percent, it was enough to greatly boost Qingyu's abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qingyu, beat her up! Vent all your resentment that piled up over fifteen years!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But, she's Elder Ye's granddaughter," she said with grit teeth. She was really frustrated. This had been troubling her for years; most of the trauma she had suffered was thanks to Ye Ziyi's minions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry. Since she made you cry so many times, you're only returning the favor once. It's not like you have to really hurt her anyway."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming trusted Elder Ye to not be an unreasonable person, or he wouldn't have bothered helping the Li Saint Clan in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We always have to overcome our fears. Only then can we go on living. Teach her a lesson and make sure she turns the other way when she sees you in the future."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Got it, Big Brother!" Qingyu's eyes began burning passionately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some kids who went too far before they matured and took advantage of their seniority or family background to bully others, relishing in the suffering of &nbsp;their victims. This time around, Qingyu wanted to make her cry just this once.</span></p>
