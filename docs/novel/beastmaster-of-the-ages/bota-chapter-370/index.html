 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a signal for their counter-attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” Sikong Jiansheng thought he had heard wrongly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Onyx Legion? What was Li Wudi talking about?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t the Onyx Legion currently attacking from the Abyssal Battlefield?” The keepers and purifiers were stunned. But in the next second, an earth-shattering roar echoed out from the Grand-Orient mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brothers of the Onyx Legion, many of our comrades died at the hands of Heaven’s Elysium. Today, it’s time for us to take revenge for them! Today, we kill our enemies together with the Grand-Orient Sect!” The Onyx Emperor charged out to boost the Onyx Legion’s morale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Onyx Legion would never forget the humiliation they had to suffer when they were defeated. Now, they could finally take their revenge and not be controlled. They were hidden in the Grand-Orient Mountain Range, and when they heard the Onyx Emperor’s speech, all of them could feel their blood boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the disbelieving gazes of the keepers and purifiers, the seventy thousand Onyx legionnaires and twenty thousand Grand-Orient guardians joined the battlefield. When they joined the battle, the guardians that were retreating suddenly stopped and launched their counterattacks. Now that they had an army of over a hundred thousand, they weren’t inferior to the invaders in terms of numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the Onyx Legion also had an army of broodmother lifebound beasts. Countless behemoths charged out from the mountain range and joined the battlefield. The Onyx Sect immediately sealed off all news when they had made their decision; otherwise, the plan would have failed if someone leaked it out. Then again, no news could leak out, since they were within the Grand-Orient Barrier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, it was finally time for them to hunt. Not only did they have similar numbers as their invaders, but they also had the home field advantage. Li Wudi had deactivated the barrier in the Abyssal Battlefield to allow the Onyx Legion in, so they wouldn’t be targeted by the spirit hazards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a total suppression when the army entered the battlefield. Not only had the Onyx Legion increased their numbers, but their masters had also gathered in the barrier nucleus to strengthen the barrier. “The Grand-Orient Barrier’s power is stronger than before!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took only an instant for it to be comparable to the Southsky Barrier. In the next second, a horrifying scene took place. Ninety-nine&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">imperial dragon pulses emerged from the bottomless hole and converged at the Grand-Orient Barrier in the Yellowflame continent.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The Abyssal Battlefield was completely defenseless, but the Yellowflame continent’s barrier had risen to a terrifying level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The barrier is now comparable to an army of a hundred thousand! We’re now comparable to an army of two hundred thousand! Brothers, why are we still waiting?!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Butcher the Cloudmist Sword School!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">imperial dragon pulse taking the lead, countless spirit hazards wrought havoc, dying the battlefield red.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the power of the fog had been boosted, the keepers and purifiers were all blind. They couldn’t see their path, nor their enemies; they could only hear shrieks and yells echoing in their surroundings. At the same time, the guardians, who wanted to protect their home, and legionnaires, who wanted revenge, charged into the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Judging from how the Onyx Legion butchered their enemies, you could tell that the Onyx Emperor had done a good job of motivating them. It looked like Li Wudi had spent the past two days coming up with a plan and preventing any news from leaking. So much so that the Onyx Legion only knew that they were going to betray Heaven’s Elysium today. And now, seeing how the keepers and purifiers were caught by surprise, they knew they had succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, it’s time to harvest.” There were many Onyx elders beside Li Wudi, brimming with killing aura as they looked at Sikong Jiansheng like prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Onyx Emperor, how dare you betray Heaven’s Elysium! Without any barrier protecting your sect, you’re just homeless beggars! Wait to be eradicated by Heaven's Elysium!” Sikong Jiansheng howled with his face pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, but the Grand-Orient Sect is willing to protect the Onyx Sect with our barrier!” Li Wudi laughed. In the next second, Li Wudi charged at Sikong Jiansheng with his lifebound beast, the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient Infernalblood Kunpeng</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, while the experts around him went after the elders standing beside Sikong Jiansheng. “Sikong Jiansheng, I heard that you humiliated my son back at the Throughgate? Today, I’ll show you the wrath of a father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sikong Jiansheng’s strength was similar to Yuwen Taiji without the Grand-Orient Sword. Furthermore, he didn’t even have his&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloudmist Sacred Sword. On the other hand, Li Wudi’s strength had risen to a whole new level. Sikong Jiansheng initially wanted to gang up on Li Wudi, but the elders around him were all being held up. In the e</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">nd, he could only face Li Wudi’s wrath all by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!” Sikong Jiansheng didn’t have a choice except gnashing his teeth and facing Li Wudi together with his Six-winged Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Garbage!” Li Wudi unleashed the Infernalblood Strike. He wasn’t interested in dragging out the fight, so he executed his strongest move right from the beginning. This attack was stronger than the one he had used to defeat Yuwen Taiji. It instantly tore the Six-winged Phoenix, which was executing its ability, in half.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone listen up! Tonight, we feast on roasted phoenix! Moreover, the spatial ring of any enemies killed by you will belong to you!” The spatial ring of every beastmaster basically contained large quantities of manna, weapons,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">spirit ores, and spirit herbs. After all, beastmasters would carry their most important assets on them. So a great amount of wealth would definitely be found today, and all those resources were the foundation of a sect. However, Li Wudi was generous enough to give them all out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone heard Li Wudi’s words, they felt their blood boiling. They would be able to harvest great wealth if they killed, and they wouldn’t have to submit it to the sect. It was the same for Onyx Sect as well. Moreover, their morale had reached a whole new level when they saw Sikong Jiansheng’s Six-winged Phoenix being split in half.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sikong Jiansheng is a cripple now!” a loud voice boomed out in the battlefield, striking fear into the hearts of the keepers and dealing a great blow to their morale. Everyone could see the bloody veins in Sikong Jiansheng’s eyes as he immediately turned and fled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where do you think you’re going?” As the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient Infernalblood Kunpeng slaughtered the Cloudmist Sword School’s elders, Li Wudi turned into a crimson streak as he chased Sikong Jiansheng and swung his sword out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Arggggggh!!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sikong Jiansheng’s legs were still running, but his upper body fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sikong Jiansheng! Where do you think you’re going?” Li Wudi stepped on Sikong Jiansheng’s head, crushing his teeth, and raised the Crimsonblood Saber in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t kill me! I surrender! I’m willing to surrender like the Onyx Sect and submit to the Grand-Orient Sect! I can get all the keepers to stop right now!” Sikong Jiansheng cried out. He wasn’t an unyielding person to begin with, otherwise he wouldn’t have bowed to Heaven’s Elysium.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, but I have no interest in raising an ingrate. Moreover, every single keeper has to die today!” Li Wudi’s laughter roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Li Wudi, you’ll suffer heaven’s wrath for starting a massacre!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A great man has to be ruthless; I’m not a sage. As for heaven’s wrath, that’s what your Cloudmist Sword School is suffering today! HAHAHA!” As Li Wudi spoke, he swung the saber down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father, stop!” A young voice suddenly called out, interrupting Li Wudi. Li Wudi was stunned as he turned around and looked at the white-haired youth behind him, drenched in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holy! Why are you here?! Do you want to die?!” Li Wudi smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me kill Sikong Jiansheng!” Tianming said with his eyes blazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go ahead.” Li Wudi’s foot was on Sikong Jiansheng, which caused his chest to cave in and prevented him from moving about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Li Tianming!!”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Sikong Jiansheng looked at the white-haired youth with his eyes gushing with flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the only thing he saw was Tianming’s cold gaze as he stared at him and stuck his tongue out, then said, “See? My wounds have recovered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will surely die!” Sikong Jiansheng roared with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up!” Tianming raised the Grand-Orient Sword and plunged it into Sikong Jiansheng’s mouth, the blade exiting from the other side of his head and stabbing into the ground. With that, Sikong Jiansheng had taken his last breath. His head tilted and his eyes were wide open—he had died with a grievance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pulling the Grand-Orient Sword out of Sikong Jiansheng, Tianming carried the corpse and soared into the sky. As he mustered all the breath in his chest, his voice roared out in the battlefield, “Sikong Jiansheng has been killed by me! I’ve returned the humiliation I suffered back then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was venting his emotions, the humiliation he had felt back in the Throughgate when his tongue was stabbed. Tianming was someone who held grudges, which was why he turned all of his enemies back in the Realm War into mutes. And today, he had finally taken his revenge against Sikong Jiansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior sect master!” Many people looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sikong Jiansheng is dead!” The news instantly spread through the battlefield like wildfire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Cloudmist Sword School was already struggling with the war, and with their sect master dead, it struck a great blow to their morale. They immediately panicked and wanted to escape, but it was too late since they were too deep into the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fog had been strengthened threefold, not to mention that they had to face the guardians, legionnaires, and the spirit hazards. So they had no idea where they could escape to. At least half of them were shrouded by the shadow of death, and had no courage to continue fighting. Facing defeat and death, they were all terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Tianming returned to Li Wudi’s side, he smiled, despite having his face covered in blood. “I’m sorry for using you to show off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. An eye for an eye, that’s what makes a true man.” Li Wudi smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So we share the same view.” Tianming immediately stepped back into the battlefield and joined the guardians slaughtering at the front line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t push yourself too much and get yourself killed,” said Li Wudi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry!” Tianming replied with a burst of laughter before he disappeared from Li Wudi’s view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a courageous lad. Just which genius gave birth to a monster like him?” Li Wudi sighed, then stepped into the battlefield once more.</span></p>
