 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-94b5d0d8-7fff-6e52-f8c3-d8eb29d11a0c"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The First Grand-Orient Battlefield was easily the most volatile location in all of the sect. Most of the grand sect events were held there, whether they were yearly evaluations, outer disciple promotion battles, or even fights between seniors. Too many births of monstrous geniuses had been witnessed there over the past millennia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the legendary figures that emerged there were the ancestors of the Li Saint Clan, who had spread their name far and wide at the battlefield in their youth. From a distance, the chaotic battlefield was covered by forests, rivers, and lakes and surrounded by a heavenly pattern barrier. On some of the blades of grass and rocks was the blood of those that came before that hadn't been cleaned up even now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Around the battlefield were ten thousand seats, located high up so they had a good view of the battlefield. Being able to show off their skills in front of an audience of so many people was the dream of every disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From a vantage point at the north end of the battlefield, a tall, white tower stretched high into the clouds, giving off an ancient and arcane sensation. The disciples of the sect knew the tower was the sect's treasure and holy ground: the Prime Tower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Prime Struggle would be taking place there. Two precious treasures had been hidden within for the most powerful disciples' taking, and today, the first battles would take place. There were sixty-six participants and thirty-three battles in total.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, the seats had all been filled, and booming cheers from the audience resonated throughout the arena. All ten thousand of the audience members were inner disciples or above. Many seniors of the sects such as chiefs, hall prefects, exalted masters, and mountain lords were there to observe the battles. As for outer disciples, not a single one of them was qualified to watch the Prime Struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance, Azure Dragon Sword Mountain's Yuan Huitian could only bring his disciples and hall prefects to watch the battles from the normal seats. Nowadays, Azure Dragon Sword Mountain was rather low profile, preferring not to antagonize disciples from other mountains or be compared with them. It was mainly due to the ones that would be representing them in the Prime Struggle, which turned out to be quite the laughingstock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To most other disciples, Tianming was too foreign, and Qingyu didn't even qualify. Gu Yu, who was just barely acceptable, didn't get a chance to join, which was why this affair was so awkward. As such, Yuan Huitian took the initiative to sit at the corner to avoid any embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To be honest, it would've been better if he just gave up on the prime struggle than doing this, as he only recently became an elder," Yuan Huitian said with furrowed brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, we will definitely have our chance!" Gu Yu said. He was quite dissatisfied with the turn of events. Turning back, he saw the other exalted masters and hall prefects of Azure Dragon Sword Mountain watching with their arms crossed, as if they dreaded the start of the Prime Struggle. Some would've not come at all if they could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's hope it ends quickly. I still have to go back to train."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. Nowadays, the standards of Azure Dragon Sword Mountain are falling. Those of our generation should snap out of it and rise back up again."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I really don't know what this elder has planned. Isn't it a little bit of a waste for him to just give out two Saintbeast War-Souls like that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chatter revealed their displeasure with the whole matter. It had been a long time since the disciples of that mountain could stand proud before the other disciples, yet it didn't seem like that would change even with their new elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The participants in today's battles didn't only include the elders' direct disciples. Instead, it was a matter of pride for all thirty-three mountains. Yet most of Azure Dragon Sword Mountain's disciples were already crestfallen before the battles had begun. At least it wouldn't be as embarrassing as losing without even putting up a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most eye-catching thing apart from the Prime Tower was no doubt the thirty-three large halls built upon the battlefield. Each of them had a large sign with the name of their mountain. For instance, the hall right in the middle had a plaque with the words 'Fengyun Immortal Mountain' written on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fengyun Immortal Mountain was founded by the first elder, Huangfu Fengyun, who was already more than a century old. He was the eldest in the council of elders. During his youth, he had earned much merit for the sect and had often defended their borders from their oppressive foes. Even now, he still held a large sway over the whole sect, his authority eclipsing even the third elder, Yuwen Fengtian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hall behind that belonged to Fengtian Mountain. To its right was Taiji Mountain, and the rightmost hall was one with a brand new sign with 'Azure Dragon Sword Mountain' inscribed on it. The halls were where the elders and their family members would watch the battles from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, First Elder Huangfu Fengyun was seated in a tall seat at the very center spot beneath the tower. At the age of hundred, even saints would look old, but his age belied his actual bodily condition. His eyes were still sharp and beaming, and it seemed like he would live for decades more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the thirty-three elders, only the fourth elder was of the same seniority as Huangfu Fengyun. She was Shangguan Jingshu, the highest-ranked female elder. A few years back, she was ranked in third place, but Yuwen Fengtian had replaced her after his grand contributions to the sect. Shangguan Jingshu sported white hair, just like Huangfu Fengyun, but she seemed really charismatic for an elder. Each of her steps and movements were filled with vigor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the battles began, Shangguan Jingshu came over to Fengyun Immortal Mountain's hall to visit the man himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Old Fengyun, I hope you don't mind my intrusion."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, it's you, Jingshu. Long time no see." Huangfu Fengyun smiled and waved. "The Grand-Orient Sect hasn't been this lively for a long time. Sit down, Jingshu, and watch this spectacle with me. Let's see how the young'uns of the new generation perform."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That was my intention as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being roughly the same age and two of the most reputable figures in the sect, they had few others to hang out and chat with. Even the second and third elders were considered their juniors by age. The two old elders sat in their tall thrones and patiently awaited the start of the battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jingshu, I've been hearing something interesting lately," the old man began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is it about Li Wudi's illegitimate son, the pentabane?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. Ye Shaoqing even took him as his disciple." The old man squinted his eyes. Given their age and vast experience, there were few things that perplexed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I asked Ye Qing about it, and heard that the child broke through two levels in half a month. He can even fight opponents three or four levels above him. Also, he only started cultivating half a year ago and had never touched cultivation before in his life. Ye Qing thinks he’s unquestionably a pentabane," Huangfu Fengtian said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then he probably is. The Li Saint Clan's ancestors have finally decided to bless them," Shangguan Jingshu said as she quietly scanned the arena. They seemed rather calm about pentabanes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the eyes of these people, even the likes of Li Wudi, or other geniuses on his level, were mere bugs they could squash if they wanted. All they treasured were those belonging to their families. Killing anyone else was of no huge consequence to them, regardless of how ridiculously powerful they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you think about that, Jingshu?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We'll see how it goes. I don't really intend to meddle. Yuwen Taiji's family, on the other hand, will definitely not let him live."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No, I was asking what you thought about Ye Shaoqing taking disciples."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I’m rather troubled by it as well. Yuwen Taiji had given him face and wanted to rope him in to their side. Why would he do something against the Yuwen Clan like that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I really don't know what’s up with Ye Shaoqing. Perhaps Ye Qing is problematic as well. Don't tell me they really intend to work toward the revival of the Li Saint Clan. I know that isn't beyond Ye Qing, but I still can't really figure this out. I have a feeling we're missing something even more crucial."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I think I can accept that result," Shangguan Jingshu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean? The two from the Yuwen Clan aren't happy with the current state of affairs. They want to reclaim the Grand-Orient Sword at all costs, and the moment they do, the council of elders will be destabilized."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come to think of it, I find it quite laughable that I'm actually hoping Heaven's Elysium will retain the Grand-Orient Sword," Shangguan Jingshu said with a pained shake of her head. "The moment Yuwen Taiji gets the sword, the council of elders will fall to ruin like all other things in the sect before it. I really don't know if even the two of us will survive it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We'll see. These matters aren’t ours to interfere with. The Realm Wars must be fought fairly. Additionally, Heaven's Elysium has managed to produce monstrous geniuses. While Yuwen Taiji said he prepared his son, Yuwen Shendu, to fight, it sounds like a wasted effort."</span></p>
