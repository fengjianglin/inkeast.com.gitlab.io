 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It started pouring when the Cloudmist keepers pressed forth, but the raindrops were white. They gathered and formed into rivers splashing down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Watch out! It’s the whitebone chillwater!” It was a water spirit hazard with black heavenly patterns. As the name would suggest, the water was cold and it could freeze people into white bones. If the victim didn’t have enough beast ki, they wouldn’t be able to resist the chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the whitebone chillwater was only part of the Grant-Orient Barrier. On the other side, there was a tidal wave of black water that threw the keepers into chaos. The black water began corroding their bodies when they came in contact with it, and many of them were swallowed by the tidal wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Watch out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Out of the way!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Screams began echoing from the keepers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of them had been killed, but it was their first time facing a sect’s defensive barrier. Furthermore, the Grand-Orient Barrier had over a hundred barrier spirit hazards, but only a minority of them had been fused into the barrier by the first ancestor. The rest was done by the Li Saint Clan’s ancestors over the years, empowering the barrier over the ten thousand years and benefiting their descendants today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was purple lightning, a region in the barrier that had turned into a sea of flames, powerful gales that split people into two, and goldnether fog that was made of countless tiny worms. When those worms powered their way through the keepers, they would leave holes in those keepers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a moment, it seemed like the Grand-Orient Barrier had turned into hell, throwing the invaders into chaos. Then again, only a small portion of the Cloudmist keepers were experiencing the spirit hazards, since they had come in great numbers, invading from all directions. So despite the white fog and spirit hazards, some of them managed to break through the defenses and made their way deep into the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the depths of the fog, the Grand-Orient guardians were waiting for them. The guardians didn’t have any fog hindering their vision, and the spirit hazards would avoid them. Even the goldnether fog made a detour.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the advantage that the guardians had in their home ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sixth elder, Zhao Zhiyuan, was clad in heavy black armor as he stood before the Grand-Orient guardians, his eyes bloodshot. He had returned to the Grand-Orient Sect before the war began, and he hadn’t told anyone about Yuwen Taiji’s location. He just silently took up his weapon and joined the war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone listen up! We’ll kill anyone who stands before us! The thirty-three immortal mountains are behind us, and they’ve been our inheritance land for the past ten thousand years! We have many young disciples and families behind us, and they’ll only be butchered if they meet the Cloudmist keepers. So we can’t afford to lose this fight! They’ll have to ask our weapons if they want to trample over our sect! The Cloudmist Sword Sect is only qualified to be someone’s lackey, so why do we have to be afraid of garbage like them?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can die, but we have to make these bastards who are trying to destroy our inheritance pay the price! If any of you is going to die, then die bringing five down with you! KILL! SLAUGHTER THEM ALL!” He wasn’t just mobilizing the guardians, but he was also the first elder to be on the battlefield. However, he was also the one who had snatched the Grand-Orient Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans were complex creatures. Zhao Zhiyuan was afraid of the nethermare venom, but now that his clan and sect were facing the threat of being slaughtered, he was willing to put his life on the line to fight. Perhaps only this could relieve the guilt in his heart. After all, he knew Tianming wasn’t dead, and there was a chance that he had already gone far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beginning with Zhao Zhiyuan, the guardians charged at the Cloudmist keepers, who were being tortured by the spirit hazards. No one was alone in this war. With the help of the fog and spirit hazards, their numbers far exceeded the Grand-Orient guardians in small-scale fights. The Cloudmist keepers who made it through the spirit hazards could only be killed. Swords broke, corpses were split in two, and lifebound beasts were torn to pieces. In a short moment, the entire battlefield had overflowed with blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the fight was going on, lightning would descend and a keeper, who had already been killed, took a bolt to his head and exploded. Deaths were also accumulating for the guardians. But judging from the current situation, the keepers had a higher ratio of deaths. One side was the invader, while the other side was determined to protect their home. With different motivations between the two factions, the power they could exhibit was also different. So much so that many keepers were frightened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly speaking, there were only ten thousand guardians from the Grand-Orient Sect, and their numbers were less than one-fifth of their enemies. But with just over ten thousand people, they withstood the first wave of invaders from the Cloudmist Sword School.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood was flowing on the ground and countless dismembered corpses were falling, with spirit hazards wreaking havoc in the battlefield. The guardians weren’t alone in the war. Within the barrier were the thirty-three immortal mountains with the Grand-Orient Sacred Mountain situated in the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one stood atop the Grand-Orient Sacred Mountain, they would see countless colored rays extending out in the barrier. The rays were so tightly packed together they looked like a net. Because of those rays, the thirty-three immortal mountains looked even more gorgeous. On every immortal mountain, there were hundreds of rays extending out and converging on the sacred mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless disciples stood beside their masters beneath colored rays, transmitting their beast ki into them, which was ultimately gathered in the Grand-Orient Barrier. Those colored rays were also known as the barrier spirit threads. Those threads were an important part to the barrier; they were the source of its energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the weakest disciple could do their part and transmit their beast ki over to participate in the war. They would take turns resting and transmitting their beast ki to help maintain the barrier’s operation. Perhaps some of them felt fear, but more of them were determined to fight the Cloudmist Sword School to the last person standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their beast ki lit the threads, which converged at the sacred mountain and allowed the elders and chiefs to control the entire barrier. There were ninety-nine barrier nuclei on the sacred mountain, protecting the barrier core. Today, all ninety-nine elders and chiefs were present, controlling the barrier. Aside from the automated attacks of the spirit hazards, most attacks were controlled by a master in their barrier nucleus for more efficiency and power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The barrier nuclei could control the direction of the white fog and spirit hazards. This required an enormous amount of beast ki, so the masters on the sacred mountain were separated into two groups. So if someone got tired, another master would step in and replace them. The entire Grand-Orient Sect was actively participating in the war—some were controlling the barrier to kill their enemies, some were fighting on the front line, and some were contributing their beast ki to ensure the maintenance of the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elysian Emperor had been right; if the three sects had come together to crush the Grand-Orient Sect, everyone would give up in despair. But the Cloudmist Sword School was the only one attacking right now, which allowed them to have some confidence in fighting off the invaders. Massacre could only be seen on the sacred mountain. Although the war had just begun, the corpses of lifebound beasts lying on the ground had brought the intensity of the war to a whole new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one could take a step back when they saw their friends and family dying in battle. The eyes of the keepers were bloodshot, and the guardians had their families behind them. None of them had a choice but to fight to their last breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Cloudmist Sword School is just kissing up to Heaven’s Elysium to survive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re just a bunch of people who are used to being lackeys. They don’t have any backbone at all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You bunch of hyenas want to destroy the Grand-Orient Sect? Dream on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brothers, let’s show them the power of the guardians!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sikong Jiansheng, why hide away and only watch the battle? Are you a coward? Come out and let me kill you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guardians mocked, but only the roaring of lifebound beasts could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who says that only our Cloudmist Sword School is attacking?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys are dead! The Onyx Sect is probably starting from the Abyssal Battlefield!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Grand-Orient Sect flourished for ten thousand years, but you guys are just a bunch of weaklings now! And someone like you dares look down on our Cloudmist Sword School? Wake up from your fantasy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After today, the Grand-Orient Sect will only be left with corpses!” They didn’t need to speak, because everyone here knew that this wasn’t the only battlefield. The Abyssal Battlefield probably had to withstand a stronger pressure coming from the Onyx Sect and their beast tide!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
