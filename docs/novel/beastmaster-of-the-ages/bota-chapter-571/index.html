He then executed an intermediate empyrean-ranked battle art, Skyseize Sword Art. Seizing the sky, no, the heavens themselves, was an act of indomitable will. The strike was so quick that it allowed him to avoid at least half of the spiritsource abilities that were unleashed. Even the lightning bolts of Chaos Disaster that charred him all over didn't weaken the momentum of his charge at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just as the strike was about to connect, the Prime Tower appeared and blocked it. The autarch's sword strike clashed with the Prime Tower at high speeds, causing it to deviate thanks to the soul servant pushing it away. Then, the tower suddenly grew in size and rammed into Autarch Qian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Autarch Qian spat out another mouthful of blood. Just as he was backing away, Ying Huo's Pyros Imperius struck his thigh and sent charred flesh flying. It was quickly followed up with ten successive punches from the Soulfiend, slamming the autarch into the ground. The cherry was finally topped when a huge amount of Bloodfiend Disaster was infused into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Buzz off!" Autarch Qian sent his saint ki exploding outwards, blasting away the Bloodfiend Disaster and breaking off from the barrage of punches. Despite being the lone fighter, he had the power of the saint ki belonging to a second-level empyrean saint, which wasn't something to scoff at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he broke free, he immediately started searching for Tianming, only to wonder where he was. When he turned back, he saw the white-haired youth swinging the Grand-Orient Sword and unleashing Myriad-Sword Demise as well as Sword Imperealm Formation. The power of that strike far eclipsed that of many first-level empyrean saints!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a loud twang, Autarch Qian parried it, almost losing his grip on Primeval Styx.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How does despair taste like, old demon?" Tianming said, his rage soaring through the skies. He then split Grand-Orient Sword into two and pierced one of them into the autarch’s lower abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianming had tried to ruin his saint palace, but the autarch's saint ki was too powerful. It was able to push out the sword even after it had pierced into flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a loud bang, the autarch punched Tianing's black arm and sent him flying, causing him to cough out blood. This only made him look even more fearsome and bloodthirsty. "You should thank the heavens that a vile beast like you was allowed to live for so long!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the autarch was about to respond, the Primordial Bloodbane Kunpeng dug its claws into him, tearing even more flesh out, revealing the bones that lay underneath. Lan Huang then used Primordial Soundwave, shattering both his eardrums.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank them? The heavens envy us, the Theocrats! They even fear us!" He climbed back up from a pool of blood before cackling madly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're wrong. The ways of heaven focus on the bigger picture. In the eyes of the heavens, your Nineshades Clan is nothing but an infinitesimally small blemish on the world, a mere ant! All you had going for yourself was finding a way to perpetuate your clan by sacrificing the lives of others! You don't even stand a chance to seize the heavens for yourselves! Those who walk the path of a false ruler will eventually be taken out by a true sovereign. Today, the one who will be meting out the judgment of the heavens is none other than me, Li Tianming!" His eyes blazed with the glory of suns as the Grand-Orient Sword grew immeasurably bright in his hands.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Heh, you, of all people, claim to be the true sovereign? Hahahahaha! That's a joke if I've ever heard one! You're far too naive, too fresh! Even if you wipe my clan out, false heroes and hypocrites like you will never be able to overcome our clan's will to shock the heavens! The Theocrats shall never perish for all eternity!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Dream on." Killing intent seeped out of Tianming as he and all three of his lifebound beasts, the soul servant, and the kunpeng went all out. There was no way the autarch would be able to take on so many different attacks, all the while Ying Huo and the Soulfiend sneaked in more and more attacks when he wasn't looking. The complexity of all the different attacks blended together into an unpredictable, chaotic barrage. Each individual one was tough to deal with, let alone all of them together!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tianming, my little friend, that's why I said you were too naive! Even if I perish today, you will one day come to be tortured for eternity! You will never be able to rest in peace!" As he spoke and laughed, he took out a thick heavenly pattern tome that seemed to be five stars at least. Five star tomes were priceless, far more valuable than even the Bloodbane Formation. Autarch Qian activated it with his blood and targeted Tianming with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You want to fight me? Even if you're an unmatched genius that can stand against me and cause me to despair, you will die all the same!" The tome had already been activated. It would be fatal if it connected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's the Soulsmother Tome!" Feiling said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I see." Tianming nodded without any other reaction. Instead, he continued straight towards the autarch like a moth to the flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Prime Tower manifested above the autarch’s head and pressed down on him heavily, causing him to have no choice but to block it with his sword while pointing the tome at Tianming with his other hand. "So long, Li Tianming."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression was one of pure bliss as the book faded into his sea of consciousness, still aimed at Tianming. He could already imagine the sight of Tianming's soul being smothered out, the sight of him dying a horrible death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Tianming close his eyes, it seemed as if the tome had worked. But the next moment, his eyes opened once more as Sword Imperealm Formation and Myriad-Sword Demise were unleashed. So what if he had the Soulsmother Tome? Was it a match for his Soul Tower?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is dementia getting to you? Why'd you pick a soul attack heavenly pattern tome to use against me of all people?" His sword strike connected the moment the Prime Tower suppressed Autarch Qian, shaking the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Prime Tower slammed down on the autarch's head while the Grand-Orient Sword pierced through his saint palace. The thick sword then went all the way through his body. When Tianming drew it out, spiritual energy came blasting out incessantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aaaagh! My power! My precious power!" The autarch's brain had been crushed just now. His eyes were filled with blood as he stretched his hand out and pressed it against his saint palace, but that was an exercise in futility. He audibly fell to a kneeling position before Tianming. If Tianming hadn't stopped the soul servant, Autarch Qian would've been flattened to a meat paste already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is not your power. All this is, is the crystallization of the atrocities you have committed." He stretched his hand out and lifted Autarch Qian up by his hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hahaha..." The autarch looked at him and continued to laugh. He still tried to raise his sword in an attempt to kill Tianming, but that slash didn't even leave a cut on Tianming's shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How does it feel to be a mere mortal? Or, as you so like to put it, a little fish? Huh?" Tianming asked with a smirk. "Old fool, I prepared a fishing rod specifically for you. I will let you have a taste of this. I've been waiting for this chance for far too long!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took out a fishing rod from his spatial ring. As it was a bestial weapon, its hook was extremely sharp. Tianming hooked the autarch by his mouth and raised the rod. He lifted him up before tossing him into Azure Oceanic Purgatory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the waves roared, the fishing rod shook ferociously. As the autarch slammed into the ground, his saint ki dissipated completely, causing him to age at a rate visible to the naked eye. His hair turned entirely white, and wrinkles began to form all over his body. He even began to hunch and got many liver spots.</span></p>

Tianming pulled the rod and lifted him back out. All the autarch could do was widen his eyes and stare at him blankly. After truly losing everything he had and experiencing despair, he gained an experience that used to be foreign to him. He finally knew the extent of despair and desperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianming carefully pulled him up by his white hair, afraid of accidentally killing the elderly man who was on his last breaths. "Autarch Qian, the Cyclic Mirror has been shattered, and all your descendants have been wiped out. Now, I want to ask you this: What happened to the so-called will of the Theocrats, huh? Did it turn to ash after I gave it a good stomping?</span></p>

He looked more pitiful than anyone could be, but this was his just deserts. It was heaven's judgment itself.</span></p>

We Theocrats have killed so many more of you than you have ours. It's a steal of a deal, really. It's a shame your forebears all died without rhyme or reason." The autarch broke out into another fit of laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're mistaken. Firstly, wiping out the Nineshades Clan was the only wish of my forebears, and that has already been fulfilled. Secondly, Brother Tianming will make you pay the price a thousand times over. Just you wait," Ye Lingfeng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he didn't personally get to kill the members of the Nineshades Clan, he was the one who kept the Evil Suppression Formation running at full tilt the whole time. Not to mention, he was a huge help in today's decisive battle. Without him, there was no way the Decimo Dao Palace would be able to fight back against the Theocrats.

You stabbed my godfather once, so I will stab you a hundred times. If you can endure it, I'll let you live." Tianming's voice was cold, and he wore a mask devoid of expression as if what he was saying was nothing consequential in the least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No...

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With an audible squelch, Tianming stabbed his heart last before turning to leave.

Your punishment is eternal solitude. You'll have an eternity to ponder the nature of life and the relationship between man, the heavens, and dao," Li Muyang said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The scariest thing in the world is solitude.

What was endless solitude like? There would be no rest; he would have to be sealed in the void alone, conscious the whole time. While one might be able to take a day of it, what kind of nightmare would an eternity of that be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The wheels of karma turn without stopping. The effects that come about as a result of our actions will definitely come. The way of the heavens is so deep that all you know is but a drop in the ocean. Yet, you dared to foolishly ascribe your shallow notions to the way of the heavens. Perhaps in a hundred years, in your lone meditation, you'll understand what it truly is. In a thousand years, you might even understand what divine punishment is. In myriad years, you'll know that you're nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the eternal life of the boundless cosmos!" Li Muyang's words were so profound that Autarch Qian couldn't even begin to comprehend even the superficial meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Dongyang Qian, in your own words, you are also a fish to the heavens. If a fish like you dares to eat other fish, what do the heavens prey on?" Li Muyang's words caused the light to fade from the autarch's eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"M-m...

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I did. And I was fortunate enough to only cross paths with you in a single lifetime. I truly hate you," she said. She was none other than Wei Jing, but to Autarch Qian, she was still Jiang Lingjing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was this whole reincarnation business about? Tianming's mind was a complete mess. He desperately needed Li Muyang to explain everything to him pronto. Why did he show up so late and not earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hate...

You'll have more than enough time to process your feelings later. You should use this time to say your farewells," Li Muyang said.</span></p>

Wei Jing didn't want to see him at all. Her shoulders shook as she said, "Thank you for raising me... But that doesn't change anything. You deserve to die ten thousand times over."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Uwu..."

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Muyang slapped his head and took out a white mist that seeped into his eyes. That was it for the autarch. Just like Li Muyang said, he would spend eternity alone. In comparison, Xuanyuan Xu's fate of being stabbed to death was far more desirable. Tianming finally took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mom!" His tears began to flow nonstop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tianming." Wei Jing opened her arms wide and embraced him. This was a hug that he would never forget for the rest of his life.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tianming," Li Muyang said with a solemn look.</span></p>
