Over two hundred thousand troops threw the innocent commoners at the huge globe in the ocean. The commoners were all bawling and screaming when they were thrown, but there was nothing they could do about their fate of being devoured by the barrier.</span></p>

The Southsky Barrier was operating at high speed, and when those innocent commoners were thrown into it, they were instantly torn into pieces. The Southsky Sect could only recall the azure dragon pulses and decrease the barrier’s power to the minimum. But even so, the commoners were instantly devoured when they were thrown at the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kids were crying in the water. As they didn’t have any beast ki, they couldn’t isolate themselves from the ocean. In the end, their cries gradually died down as they drowned. It looked like countless people struggling in hell to Tianming. The scene unfolding before his eyes was too brutal, and not even kids were spared. The kids were young; they were innocent at their age, and they hadn’t offended anyone. “Is being weak a sin…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heaven’s Elysium!!”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Tianming raised his head, looking at the purifiers and defenders. The barrier’s power had already been weakened, and they could’ve just slaughtered their way in. There was no need for them to sacrifice so many innocent lives. On the other hand, the sentinels not only had to fight the army, but they also had to save lives, which made things harder for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brothers, there’s no path of retreat for us!

As for Li Wudi, he was leading over three thousand saints to fight at the front line. Standing on his&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancient Infernalblood Kunpeng, Li Wudi’s crimson hair fluttered in the wind as he searched for Jun Shengxiao.</span></p>

However, it was too much for them to face an army of over two hundred thousand, not to mention that they also had to save lives.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It was the worst for kids. Most of them had fainted when they were washed away by the waves, and all they could do was wave their hands and feet around in the water.</span></p>

Not only did they launch their attacks at the sentinels, but they also wrought a more general sort of havoc. They could also be seen slaughtering the commoners.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;In a war, how many of them could maintain their clarity when their leader, Jun Shengxiao, had gone insane?&nbsp;</span></p>

It had just started, but the ocean had already been dyed red with blood and there were many corpses floating before Tianming’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t have any time to sigh with sorrow at the scene. He had been busy with saving lives right from the beginning. The rope in his hand was a hundred meters long, and had been specially prepared. He had experience with whips, so controlling the ropes in the ocean to save the commoners who were struggling was a simple enough matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother, there’s a kid over there!” Jiang Feiling said in a trembling voice. Before Tianming could even make his move, she had already controlled the Celestial Wings and brought him over there. Tianming was traveling at a rapid speed, which even exceeded the limits of the Heavenly Will Stage. That was because the Celestial Wings acted like fins, allowing him more efficient travel in the water. Moreover, the Temporal Field had also allowed him to race against time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianming already had over twenty people tied to his rope, but most of them were beastmasters who could move underwater with their beast ki. However, the little girl before him couldn’t do that. When Tianming arrived, her stomach was already bloated from the water she was choking on. Tianming immediately circulated his beast ki to force the water out of the little girl’s system, but the little girl had already stopped breathing. There was a high possibility that she was already dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quick! Quick!” Jiang Feiling was sobbing as she urged. The Celestial Wings trembled as they sped to the nearest heavenly pattern barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” All of a sudden, a purifier charged over from his left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Meow!” Meow Meow’s voice could be heard as it took on the Regal Chaosfiend transformation and rushed over, grabbing the little girl from Tianming’s embrace. As he tied his rope around Meow Meow, he yelled, “Ying Huo, protect them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huo was already on guard beside Meow Meow before Tianming gave the order and the lifebound beasts charged out of the ocean as quickly as possible. The purifier wanted to chase after them, but was suddenly interrupted by Tianming roaring,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get over here!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black figure dashed across the ocean to the purifier. When the middle-aged purifier raised his head, he saw Tianming, who was charging over with bloodshot eyes. “Those two lifebound beasts belong to Li Tianming! You’re Li Tianming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re smart. So as a reward, I’ll send you off!” Tianming roared, unleashing the Voidgod Sword Intent—Myriad’s Only. He swung his sword four times, each swing more powerful than the last. The purifier was instantly killed before he could scream. If he called out Tianming’s name, he would surely have attracted a lot of attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” Tianming quickly caught up to Meow Meow and carried the little girl, along with the other twenty people, into the heavenly pattern barrier. “Save the child first! She’s dying!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very quickly, someone came over to feed the child a spirit herb. In just three breaths, the child began breathing again and she opened her eyes. Fear was reflected in her eyes as she cried, swinging her limbs around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She’s alive! Big brother, she’s saved!” Jiang Feiling might be in her spiritual form, but she had tears rolling down her cheeks nonetheless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianming let out a deep breath. He immediately called Ying Huo and Meow Meow back to the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boss, it’s too chaotic! How many people will we be able to save?” Ying Huo sulked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cut the crap. We’ll save as many as we can!” Tianming had never experienced this kind of scene. Perhaps it was common throughout the realms, but it wasn’t something he could accept. Honestly speaking, his head was still buzzing even at this moment, especially when he saw how the children were struggling in despair. It was something that he would never forget in his lifetime.</span></p>

Unifying the Grand-Orient Realm wasn’t an evil goal, but using the lives of four hundred thousand innocent people as cannon fodder was beyond evil!</span></p>

The battle was so frantic that he didn’t even know how many times he escaped death. There were many times he had only escaped death thanks to the black arm and Celestial Wings. The Southsky sentinel’s armor that he was wearing was heavily damaged, and he had several bone-deep wounds.</span></p>

The Prime Tower seemed to be in a rather good mood today, as the endless white radiance allowed Tianming’s injuries to constantly recover.</span></p>

Hold on! Continue saving people!” Perhaps because he had lost too much blood, Tianming started feeling dizzy. His vision was dyed with blood, and his ears were polluted with screams of despair. Shaking his head, Tianming turned around and grabbed a spear with his black arm.</span></p>

The Earthorigin defender wielding it was covered in blood as he tried to stab it into Tianming. “Die!”</span></p>

His vision began growing blurry, which was a sign that he had exhausted himself. But everyone on the battlefield was exhausting themselves, and he wasn’t the only one.</span></p>

Was this the most righteous path? All of this felt real, and it had been deeply engraved in Tianming’s heart. His understanding of the Imperial Will was increasing at a rapid speed amid the slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strength should be used to protect and benefit lives, not to slaughter lives and flaunt one’s superiority!
