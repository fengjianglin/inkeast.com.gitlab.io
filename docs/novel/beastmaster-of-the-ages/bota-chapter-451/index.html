 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plaza was dead silent. When everyone looked up, they saw a savage expression on the West Hall King's face. He seemed ruthless, and at the edge of his patience. Bai Mo, on the other hand, looked at them calmly, as if everything was going according to plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wei Wushang wasn't his match at all."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who was the one that said he wasn't strong? He was able to defeat Wei Wushang right after ascending to sainthood. If he isn't a genius, what is he?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's so scary that I can't even properly fathom it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That was definitely a face slap, wasn’t it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He used the Mountshield Tome without any blood. Given that he could almost teleport, he must be a patternscribe too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't even feel like talking anymore. Is there no one that can stand up for those of us of the clans? Are we to let him continue acting so arrogantly?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The answer to that question was obvious: nobody could stop Tianming. Of all the Ancient Clan disciples on the ranking, Wei Wushang had been the strongest. Only the Theocrats could possibly send someone to defeat Tianming now. But with Autarch Yun's ascension, no one on the rankings still bore the Dongyang name. Above Tianming on the rankings were five Jiang Clan imperials, though.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To be honest, Li Tianming was far too ruthless. Does that mean the Decimo Dao Palace's own four halls have completely fallen out with the six halls belonging to the Divine Capital?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. It was a matter of time before it happened, anyway."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I saw the Future Hall King stop the West Hall King just now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come to think of it, the West Hall King broke the rules, right? They said it would be a fair fight, yet Wei Wushang was provided with a two star heavenly pattern tome. The power of a Goldspear Tome would’ve been enough to kill anyone in the top ten. Li Tianming almost lost his life."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How shameless."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thankfully, Li Tianming's cultivation isn't that high yet. If he was able to cultivate faster, there’d be nobody left to stop him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I feel that the chaos outside has seeped into the Decimo Dao Palace as well. I wonder if it’s related somehow."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"One of them is a power struggle in the imperial clan, while the other is a fight for the palace. They should be unrelated, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But then why are these two things happening at the same time?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don’t you see? The West Hall King and Earth Hall King have both played their hands. I doubt they'll take the loss they suffered this time kindly."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The factions of the Divine Capital should've been fighting among themselves. It seems like the Future Hall King's involvement will cause them to unite instead."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I believe so, too. The six halls have even more disciples. I doubt the other four halls can afford to make enemies of them. The Divine Capital has managed to send their roots deep into the palace, to the point that not even the palace lord dares remove them. So, how could the four halls possibly do anything about it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They really didn't understand why the Future Hall King and the rest were being so daring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone, listen!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Think about it. Could it be that the Dark Hall is taking advantage of the power struggle to deliver a blow to the Divine Capital's halls? Perhaps they're trying to go against the Theocrats."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The clans and Saint Martial Manor are affiliated with the Theocrats."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's possible..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I think it's best if we leave conjecture aside. It was just a battle between the younger, more reckless disciples who act without considering the consequences. This Li Tianming is the king of mindlessness. Perhaps the Future Hall King will get in trouble because of him. He only values him because of the potential he has as a pentabane."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. Let's not overthink this. You might draw unwanted attention if you do."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then again, I still feel they're using the juniors as proxies to incite conflict to test the Theocrats’ patience..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. Li Tianming is Li Muyang's son, the son of the person who fought against the Ancient Theocracy. Not to mention, he’s Li Shenxiao's descendant, someone who the Theocracy could barely handle. The Decimo Dao Palace used to be inferior to the Theocrats, and was driven to this place. I bet the Dark Hall is trying to use the ascension of the new autarch as an opportunity—"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shut up!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Okay!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some of the more experienced and wise people knew the lasting implications of this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Basically, Li Tianming is their sword. I wonder how far they're willing to swing him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many turned and looked at the ranking board. Now, Tianming's place took the tenth place, though where would it settle after the matches were over?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming and the rest left as the crowd stared at them. After the battle, Feiling undid their Spiritual Attachment and appeared before everyone. Regardless of how unique she was, Tianming felt that she didn't deserve to be forced to live in secrecy. Freedom was the right of all sentient beings, and that included her as well. It was only a matter of time before those of the dao palace recognized her anyways, so Tianming decided he would no longer hide her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Rumors say that Tianming was at the spiritual convergence when Su Hongyin took action. Her assassination target was a girl called Jiang Feiling, and that apparently infuriated Tianming."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Divine Capital is a land of romance, where heroes have saved countless beauties since ancient times. Beauties have always been fought over by many powerful people since those same ancient times. There are even many who sharpened their wits to marry into powerful clans, and wars have even been fought over beauties. There have even been cases where princes fought each other for a single beauty. The Primeval Autarch also had a harem of three thousand of the Theocracy's most beautiful. Who wouldn't envy him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The reason the Theocrats are so powerful and prosperous is because of their countless descendants that the autarchial harem facilitates! If the woman is talented, their children will be even more so. If the man is powerful, their bloodline will follow suit as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Quite a number of talented beauties have been fought over by the Theocrats; rivers of blood have flowed for them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"While this Jiang Feiling girl isn't even a Beast Vein cultivator, she might grow into an existence that could threaten to overturn a nation. After all, the mysterious powers she just showed are sure to catch some attention."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, you noticed it too?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. When she was attached to Li Tianming, I felt his power increase. Those wings and some other weird slowdown domain ability are surely thanks to her, too. There was even some kind of formless wall!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a discussion among the patternscribes and seniors, not normal disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Actually, everyone is underestimating her."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"She's already capable of toppling a nation as she is now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a light drizzle in the Divine Capital that evening. The dark skies and annoying raindrops caused the citizens to scurry into shelter like ants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the rain, Jiang Yu walked along the streets, feeling a little dazed. The sight of the young girl smiling brightly as she held Tianming's arm, and the loving gaze she showed him, played back nonstop in his head. It was enough to drive him mad. He felt his heart dripping blood as the raindrops continued falling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Yu, come!" someone called out all of a sudden. He looked up and saw a bunch of people passing him by. That group of people donned black hoods with hats that sported a veil, obscuring their faces. No feature of theirs was recognizable apart from their large builds. The voice that called out to him had sounded rather familiar, though. Jiang Yu shook, then hurriedly walked toward them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader of the group pushed their veil away and revealed a half-black face. While it was as dark as ink, the dark part of the face didn't look ugly. In fact, a threatening sense of terror radiated from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"C-crown Prince!" Jiang Yu knelt in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Rise," said the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Understood." Jiang Yu hastily stood up. He knew that the cohort was trying to travel covertly, without drawing attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard you’re working on a piece of art called ‘Impeccable Beauty’. Let me have a look," the man said, putting his veil back down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright." He took out a scroll and handed it to the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Yu, I heard that you drew all the beauties in the Divine Capital in this piece, right?" he asked with a smile as he unfurled the scroll.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You look like the docile kind, yet you act much like one of us. You definitely have a pure bloodline," the man joked, causing the other black-clad men around him to laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, Sir!" Jiang Yu lowered his head, letting the rain continue falling onto his long hair. The man had unfurled the scroll completely and given it a quick scan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Gu Xiyu, Gusu Yuyao, Jiang Yufei, Jiang Yutong, Zhao Kexin, Xiao Yuhe, Mu Beibei, Chi Lan... I've had my fun with half of those you consider beauties. I was about to take them into my Skysource Palace," the man said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your Highness truly is amazing...." Jiang Yu didn't know how to react. Either way, his heart was still metaphorically bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jiang Yu."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you like the beauty in the middle, too?" the man asked, his eyes peeking through the veil with a domineering pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The middle?" He had drawn her from memory, and she was his favorite part of the piece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Yu's body shook when he recalled the man said 'too'. "I wouldn't dare!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's fine, I was just messing with you." The others around the man laughed again. When he finished, he returned the painting to Jiang Yu and patted his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your Highness, I’m honored to be of service," he said, cold sweat forming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Listen well. Come to my place tonight. I’ll give you something. Use it to kill Li Muyang's son on the day he challenges you," the man calmly said, as if he was talking about the most trivial of matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Understood!" Jiang Yu said with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wei Ji is sick in the head for giving away a two star heavenly pattern tome as a trump card. Haha, what a joke..." The rest joined the laughter once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Yu didn't dare say anything, for all of them were people he should avoid antagonizing as best he could. He and Wei Wushang were merely small fish in the pond, while that man was the undisputed ruler of all the juniors in the Divine Capital. In fact, he could be the one to decide the fate of the Theocracy. In terms of status, he was Jiang Yu's uncle, of sorts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone’s seen it, right? This young lady is indeed a stunning figure. I wonder how I’ll change when she rides me instead," he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We all want to know, too," said the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your Highness, isn't this just a matter of making an edict? Why go through the trouble?" someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That, is what you don't get. Women are prey. You need to hunt them like game. Women that are too easily obtained taste bland. That's not the case for the women of our enemies, though," said the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is Your Highness going to make her a consort?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's something that merits serious consideration. While she's enchanting, she might not live for too long. While I... am fated to never perish!" The man looked toward the palace compound with a begrudging glare. He pressed Jiang Yu's head down, causing him to roll on the ground. Jiang Yu got back up and knelt without moving. He was now completely wet and muddy, but he didn't even dare spit out the mud in his mouth, choosing to swallow it instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His stomach felt ill and his heart still ached. By the time he looked back up, the man was already walking away. Jiang Yu's bloodshot eyes seemed like those of a ferocious beast.</span></p>
