The secrets of the black arm lay in the claws and hexagon scales, which allowed him to pierce through the formation. The scales could even attract the heavenly patterns on the formation, much the same as it could for the heavenly patterns on the Grand-Orient Sword. He could crush, dissolve, and converge them into his body. With that, he would gradually gain an insight into the profundities of those heavenly patterns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this the reason why my father was able to cultivate so quickly? This arm should be the mystery on my body, and it probably has nothing to do with the Ancient Qilin Clan, right?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;However, Tianming soon gave up thinking about it, as it felt terrific.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianming soon came to several conclusions. First, his claws could pierce through the formation, but he had no idea if it would work for other formations as well. After all, some formations weren’t like the Infernal Soul Formation, such as the Bloodbane Formation, which he had no idea how to break. Second, his arm could quicken his pace of comprehending his Heavenly Will. Third, the profundities of the heavenly patterns on the formation seemed to be useful to his Imperial Will. And finally, Tianming noticed that the formation could convert beast ki into spiritual energy, and when he held onto the threads with his Ancient Devil Arm, he noticed he could extract the energy provided by the Ancient Qilin Clan’s disciples to use in his cultivation like the Prime Tower!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why didn’t I discover the black arm’s control over heavenly patterns and formations sooner? That means it’s probably an ability that only recently awakened after I came to the Theocracy of the Ancients. It was just that I hadn’t discovered it yet.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;After all, he had already tried using his black arm to touch the golden heavenly patterns on the Grand-Orient Sword’s fifth gate before, but he wasn’t able to crush and absorb it like he had today.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So that means that I only have to use my black arm to come in contact with the formation and the Grand-Orient Sword’s heavenly patterns to increase the speed of my Imperial Will’s growth! Since I can absorb spiritual energy from the Prime Tower&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">and</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;the formation, I can also enhance my spiritsources, not to mention that the effects here might be better than the tombstones in the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Mausoleum!

As there were so many people around, no one would notice if Tianming extracted some energy for himself. He smiled bitterly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I should be here to suffer, but it looks like it’s a huge opportunity for me instead. If it wasn’t for the fact that I can’t see Ling’er, I wouldn’t even want to leave this place.…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He bet that everyone in the Ancient Qilin Clan must think he was depressed after coming in, and no one had thought that it would make him happy instead. But what was with this black arm of his? The arm itself was Tianming’s greatest secret. He was already feeling impatient trying to use his newly discovered ability to enhance his cultivation speed; he could sense that his Imperial Will was growing at a visible rate, and it was the same for his three spiritsources as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you guys catch up to the growth of my Imperial Will?” Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What nonsense are you talking about? My Infernal Will doesn’t require me to comprehend it at all; it’s too simple. The growth of our Heavenly Will is being limited by you. So as long as your cultivation increases, it won’t be a problem for us,” Ying Huo said arrogantly. After all, it used to be an existence that ate suns! It just needed to unlock its bloodline shackles to regain its power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the three primordial chaos beasts hadn’t been turned into lifebound beasts and restricted by the symbiotic cultivation system, they could swiftly recover their power without any bottlenecks. Then again, they had also benefited from being in the symbiotic cultivation system, and there might be a solution to resolving it in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

Gradually, he even forgot the flow of time. With Bai Zijin looking after him, he wouldn’t have to worry about anyone interfering with him. As time passed, he would occasionally place his left hand on the Infernal Soul F</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ormation</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.</span></p>

With it, he could use his Insightful Eye to study the changes in the heavenly patterns in more detail. So he had been constantly using the Insightful Eye for the past few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm?” On this day, Tianming could sense his third eye trembling, then his vision was dyed crimson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on?” Tianming closed his eyes and focused entirely on his third eye. As it could be due to the Infernal Soul F</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ormation</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, the vision he was seeing started changing. He suddenly saw a howling sea of flames before him. As he looked down, when his vision got through the last layer of the f</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ormation</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, he saw that the boiling magma was actually black!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was magma as far as Tianming could see in this strange world, formed into a sea. Bubbles were popping in the magma. There were only a handful of places where you could land, but those black, metallic rocks were as hot as the magma as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where is this place? Is this where the Infernal Soul Race is imprisoned?” Tianming was shocked as his vision constantly changed. His surroundings were covered in a thick layer of fog, and even with his Insightful Eye, there was a limit to what Tianming could see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his vision suddenly shifted once more, he seemed to have arrived on a small island. There was a crimson altar on the island, and Tianming felt even more shocked when he saw tens of thousands of people sitting beneath the altar with their legs crossed. All of them looked weird, seeming to be a combination of humans and beasts. There were some with humanoid bodies and a beast head, and others with a human head and the body of a beast. They came in all forms, and most of them were ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were tightly packed together. Tianming was right behind them, and even though he couldn’t see the expression on their faces, he could hear their cries. They were crying, but they also regarded death as peace. All of them were holding hands, and black flames blazed on their bodies. The flames were strange, as they weren’t damaging their bodies, but it was also them that caused the people to scream out in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those were the flames of infernal souls. Suddenly, tens of thousands of crimson threads extended out from the altar and bound themselves to every single person there. As Tianming’s vision followed the altar, he saw a black-haired youth. The youth had a lean figure, without much flesh. His skin was terribly pale, but at the very least, he didn’t have any visible beast traits. His black hair was fanned out on the altar, and countless crimson threads enveloped his body. Most of the threads were gathered on his head, blocking Tianming from seeing how the youth looked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the tens of thousands of other people were still screaming out in pain as they hugged each other. Suddenly, the black flames converged together, forming an ocean of flames and surging toward the youth on the altar through the threads.</span></p>
