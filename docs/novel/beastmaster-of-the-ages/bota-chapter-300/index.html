 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were twenty elders accompanying the disciples from Southsky Sect, much more than Grand-Orient Sect. The reason so many of their elders had come in the first place was to protect Tianming. The Southsky Sect, on the other hand, had fifty elders to begin with, hence their higher numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Southsky Sect had their own council of elders, but their positions and power were different from those in the Grand-Orient Sect. They mainly served the sect master instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Sect Master Weisheng Tianlan had personally brought twenty elders with him to the Realm Wars, a sign that he heavily prioritized this event. He was dressed all in white and had long, flowing hair. He seemed like a young man, and based on his looks, behavior, and charisma, he didn't seem too much older than Ye Shaoqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Weisheng Tianlan looked rather pleasant—handsome, even—much like a privileged young man from a good family. While Ye Shaoqing shared some of that bearing, he had a much sharper gaze thanks to his mastery of swordsmanship. In stark contrast, the Southsky sect master seemed like a gentleman and nothing more. Unlike the Grand-Orient Sect Master, Weisheng Tianlan was definitely a genius among geniuses for being able to become sect master at his age. At the very least, he wouldn't be any bit inferior to Yuwen Taiji. His fellow sect masters from the Onyx Sect and Cloudmist Sword School were born in the same generation as his father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Greetings, Grand-Orient Elders. I appreciate the hospitality."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sect Master Weisheng, please take a seat," Huangfu Fengyun said as the person with the most seniority in the sect. While he was much older, he still spoke respectfully. Seniority of age didn't matter in the face of actual status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Senior Huangfu, you're too polite," Weisheng Tianlan said as he and his elders took their seats and started chatting with old friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ruosu, you all come in as well," Weisheng Tianlan called out after he sat down. Four young disciples came in, three boys and a girl. The most elite disciples in Southsky Sect were known as the southsky disciples. They enjoyed the greatest care and guidance their sect had to offer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianming's eyes fell on the girl who led them and he was immediately awed. She was dressed in an elegant white dress, and her beautiful face gave off a gentle glow and was flawlessly fair, like ivory. Beneath her fair cheeks were faint splashes of crimson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a dignified aura that wouldn't tolerate any disrespect. Her eyes sparkled with a cool silence that was neither charming nor unlikeable, but just right. The white dress made Tianming think of a certain someone from his past, with the main difference being this girl's far superior family background, giving her an aloof sense that Mu Qingqing didn't possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is Ruosu. I recall that she was only eight the last time she met with Shaoqing," Weisheng Tianlan said. He seemed to be an old friend of Ye Shaoqing's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Girls really change a lot as they grow up. She's as beautiful as a goddess now," Ye Shaoqing praised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's one thing, but yours is another. You're getting rather old. It's about time you settled down."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh, that won't do. I want to play around for a few more years yet."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they spoke, Weisheng Ruosu greeted the elders with the other three southsky disciples before they sat opposite Tianming. They were potential rivals, after all, so it couldn't hurt for them to check out their competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tianming my little bro, you've fallen for this beauty, haven't you? Are you going to cheat when Ling'er's asleep? Don't worry, I definitely won't tell," Ying Huo said from the lifebound space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Cut your crap. She’s at Heavenly Will. I'm only trying to get a feel for her power!" he spat back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Weisheng Ruosu among the four was at the same level as Yuwen Shendu. People like them definitely had insane talent. The other three were on the level of Zhao Lingzhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Weisheng Ruosu introduced the other three disciples as Weisheng Qingluan, Bai Taijun and Xi Menglin, respectively. Weisheng Qingluan was Weisheng Ruosu's younger brother by a year. They were the sect master's children; he seemed to be quite the accomplished teacher. As both of his children would be participating in the Realm Wars, he felt he stood a rather good chance this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tianming, Yunfeng, Lingzhou, you all should get to know them as well," Huangfu Fengyun said after he introduced them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Weisheng Tianlan looked at the three of them before turning to Ye Shaoqing and asking, "Where's Yuwen Taiji's son? I heard he also reached Heavenly Will. Why isn't he here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had also realized that nobody from Yuwen Taiji's faction was among the elders and didn't think that Yuwen Taiji himself would be absent. He wouldn't have come to the banquet if he had known.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Things are a little complicated. I'll tell you about it in more detail later tonight. Basically, we're only sending these three untrained kids to join the Realm Wars," he joked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn't think the others would take his joke seriously. The white-haired first elder of Southsky Sect, Gu Qiuyu, couldn't hold back and said, "Is the Grand-Orient Sect so afraid of being humiliated that you intend to lose at the Throughpath before going back?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a rather horrid accusation that made things rather awkward for Huangfu Fengyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's not right. I heard that Yuwen Taiji needs to get the Grand-Orient Sword to dominate their sect," said another elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing them speculating, Huangfu Fengyun glanced at Ye Shaoqing, who had no choice but to explain what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My disciple, Li Tianming, son of Li Wudi, killed Yuwen Shendu before he even got the chance to use the Spiritburn Tome his father had prepared." He glanced at Tianming to make sure the others knew who he was talking about. When he finished, the elders turned to look oddly at Ye Shaoqing and Tianming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Shaoqing, you're not joking around, right?" Weisheng Tianlan said with utter flabbergastment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I knew you wouldn't believe it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How could someone at Unity defeat someone at Heavenly Will?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Pentabane."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elders of the Southsky Sect all widened their eyes. Seeing Tianming's white hair, they asked, "Are you certain?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course," Huangfu Fengyun said. "We've been paying attention to him for a few months now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How can a pentabane only be at Unity? Which level is he at?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Tianming was the focus of all their attention. His rise to prominence had happened right before the Realm Wars, so he was relatively unheard of outside the sect. Huangfu Fengyun and the rest explained his origins, but said he had cultivated for some two years to make the story less hyperbolic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"So, you're saying he can face a Heavenly Will cultivator despite being only at Unity?" Weisheng Tianlan asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If he manages to utilize his full potential, I guess. He might be a little weaker than that, usually," Ye Shaoqing said, having heard about Feiling. He knew she was asleep, so Tianming would be weaker than usual without her help. Even so, Tianming had had a recent breakthrough to the sixth level of Unity, so he was now about as strong as he was when he’d fought Yuwen Shendu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"He sounds decent. Even so, I don't fully believe you yet. I guess I'll have to see how he does during the Realm Wars," Weisheng Tianlan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Definitely."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they spoke, the first elder, Gu Qiuyu, still seemed rather doubtful. Looking at Tianming, he said, "I recall that pentabanes have bane-rings. Let me see them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Nope," Tianming said, as his bane-rings had transformed into words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You don't even dare to show your bane-rings, yet you claim to be a pentabane?" Gu Qiuyu merely smirked without saying much else, causing the atmosphere to grow awkward. He definitely thought Tianming was faking it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My friends of the Grand-Orient Sect, I almost believed that wild story of yours," Gu Qiuyu said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Enough from you," Weisheng Tianlan strictly said, shutting him up. Even so, doubt had already set in most of the Southsky Sect elders; not that it mattered. At least the sect master seemed to believe him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The last time the trial at the Throughpath took place was three generations ago. Based on that time, the disciples can easily gather in groups near the end of the path. It’d be a good idea to form alliances before the trials. In recent years, the Onyx Sect has completely submitted to Heaven's Elysium, and the Cloudmist Sword School was brought into prominence by them in the first place. I worry that their disciples will take all seven positions from us.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's one thing for us to not be able to take the sword, but it's another thing if they gang up on our disciples." That was the reason they even held this banquet in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Since that's the case, we should let these seven youths get to know each other so they can support each other later, right?" Ye Shaoqing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's exactly it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aren't you afraid our disciples won't be strong enough to team up with yours?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I am, but I trust your character."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Deal. Since that's the case, I’ll vouch for these three's abilities. If they turn out to be burdens on your disciples, you can come looking for me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing him so confident, Weisheng Tianlan felt somewhat relieved. However, some among the twenty elders didn't feel the same, such as the first elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four disciples themselves looked at Tianming and the rest doubtfully, as if they were a little unhappy. The green-clad youth, Weisheng Qingluan, however, came to Tianming and asked, "Friend, are you really from the Li Saint Clan? I heard the Weisheng Clan came from the same line of descent as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianming chatted with the bloke and found him to be a decent person. He sounded really friendly and reasonable, like Weisheng Tianlan. Upbringing truly made a difference in one's character; there wasn’t a hint of sketchiness in the way he spoke and acted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sis, Tianming's pretty interesting! Come and join us!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The whole time, Weisheng Ruosu had been keeping her head lowered. She had remained quiet throughout the whole time her seniors were talking. It was only when her brother called out to her that she looked at Tianming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Nice to meet you, Miss Ruosu. I'm Li Tianming."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Likewise."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a cool beauty, after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? Are you charmed?" Ying Huo asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm only making alliances! You bugger off!"</span></p>
