 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elders all had their heads lowered. Only Shangguan Jingshu stood up and said in a half fearful voice, "Sect Master, I've let them go."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuwen Taiji squinted. "Why?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Li Tianming has done us a great boon by retrieving the Grand-Orient Sword."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that Yuwen Taiji and Tianming had a blood feud, yet she had actually let him go. Many immediately thought that she was a goner. As far as they were aware, Yuwen Taiji was someone that was ruthless to the bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, he looked to Shangguan Jingshu, someone who was old enough to be his grandmother, and motioned with his hand for her to walk towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She grit her teeth and said, "Sect Master, I know I wronged you. Please allow me to die in service of the sect!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words made many feel for her, but little did they expect Yuwen Taiji to take out two black pills and place them in her and Zhao Zhiyuan's hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You two have served the sect well. Why would I punish you?" he said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shangguan Jingshu sighed in relief. She made the right bet that Yuwen Taiji would play the role of a good guy now that he had finally become sect master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you, Sect Master!" Zhao Zhiyuan said as he knelt and teared up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please drop the formalities," he said with a wave, then looked at Shangguan Jingshu and smiled. In a voice only the two of them could hear, he said, "I knew that you’d let him go so the Li Saint Clan would live on. However, I have a way to make sure he dies."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words sent chills down her spine. By the time she looked up, Yuwen Taiji had passed her by. He stepped in front of the crowd and said, "Bring me every single member of the Li Saint Clan!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd didn't understand what that entailed. Fatepath Peak and Goldgleam Mountain had already been abandoned, and the members of the four bloodlines of the Li Saint Clan were mingling with the rest of the sect members. However, none of them dared disobey their new sect master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Li Xuanyi as leader, he brought the remnants of the clan together and came to Yuwen Taiji. There weren't many of them remaining; only old men and babies aged two or three days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sect Master, do you need anything?" Li Xuanyi hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right as he finished, Yuwen Taiji thrust the Grand-Orient Sword into his chest. Li Xuanyi instantly collapsed dead with his eyes wide open. The only saint of the Li Saint Clan had died in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuwen Taiji raised the sword and announced, "Have everyone from the Li Saint Clan exiled outside the Grand-Orient Barrier. They are to be killed without exception!" Countless people paled in disbelief at those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sect Master, no!" Shangguan Jingshu cried anxiously. "The Li Saint Clan has supported the sect for millennia! Everything we have now is thanks to them! Even though they've fallen from grace, they’re still our benefactors! How can we exterminate them like this? Sect Master, you're attempting to end the thousand-generation legacy of the Li Saint Clan?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, most of the remnants of the clan were either too young or past their prime. While they had poor talent, they were among the last traces of the once-glorious Lifesbane Clan. It was such an atrocious act that some other elders chose to speak up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Everyone, silence!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;am the sect master, not you! Anyone that blabbers on will feel my wrath!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was enough to shut up the elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes!" Many Grand-Orient guardians cultivated by the Yuwen Clan stood out and surrounded the Li Saint Clan members. Now that they no longer had a single saint, they were powerless to resist. Cries of agony and fear rang out all of a sudden. It was so abrupt that they had been apprehended by the guardians before they could try anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Elders! Please, save us!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sect Master! Sect Master! We know our place! We’ll support you! Please, don't kill us!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yansheng, Li Yunting, Li Xuanhe and the rest knelt in a panic and kowtowed with abandon. It was a horrifying sight to behold; nobody would believe that the once-glorious Li Saint Clan would be lined up for slaughter without a single one of them able to resist. Every last one of them cried and shuddered, but the key fact was that with their abilities, there was nothing they could do to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a world where might made right, their sin was being weak. No matter how they begged, the fate of the Li Saint Clan was sealed. Just moments before, the elders had supported Yuwen Taiji to become the sect master. And now, they had lost control over him and were powerless to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huangfu Fengyun and the rest had long worried that such a thing would happen. Even so, regardless of how hard it was for the rest, the members of the Li Saint Clan were driven from the Grand-Orient Barrier without exception, including even newborns. Many others followed, but remained within the barrier to see what would happen to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Cloudmist Sword School members watched from afar with interest, but they didn't approach in fear that it was a ploy from the Grand-Orient Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What’s the meaning of this?" Li Jingyu and the rest came forward and said. "They're all members of our clan!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming swept his eyes across and saw thousands of them lined in rows and forced to kneel by the guardians. The guardians’ blades were placed against the Li Saint Clan members’ necks—an obvious sign they were going to execute them! Were they going to exterminate the Li Saint Clan at their roots?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't just Tianming; not even Ye Qing, Ye Shaoqing, and the rest could ever have expected they would go this far. What would that mean for the Grand-Orient Sect? What kind of demon would take the lives of countless innocents, including a few hundred newborns? Only Yuwen Taiji could possibly have pushed the bar so low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They watched as Yuwen Taiji brought his minions to the members of the Li Saint Clan. Many members of the sect watched him with rage, but no one could stop him. Huangfu Fengyun and the others had shot themselves in the foot, and there was nobody left to stop Yuwen Taiji, now that they needed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuwen Taiji dragged Li Yansheng of the Fire Bloodline to him and looked around. "Ye Shaoqing, I know you're nearby, watching! From now on, I'll kill a member of the Li Saint Clan every three breaths until you show up. Whether the Li Saint Clan is completely exterminated depends on you. To be honest, I don't wish to kill the old and young either. It's a shame that you're the one who caused them to die." The moment he finished, he killed the Heavenly Will Li Yansheng and his lifebound beast in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others from the clan were pressed to the ground alongside their lifebound beasts. After that, Yuwen Taiji killed Li Yunting of the Lightning Bloodline, as promised. The members of the clan cried in shock for each member that was killed. Many younger ones had already fainted, including Li Chiling, Li Linghe, and Li Jincan. They crumbled as they watched their family die at the hands of Yuwen Taiji.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a master of psychology and knew exactly which buttons to push to get others to bend to his will. He knew that even if Ye Shaoqing left the sect, he wouldn't go far, and his guess was right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shameless!" Ye Shaoqing's eyes were bloodshot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't go!" Ye Qing said, holding him back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, he's definitely going to kill you. You won't return alive," Ye Yuxi said with a pale look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Li Saint Clan having so many members, there was no way they'd be able to save them all. Where would they even hide them? Not to mention, it was partly their own fault for underestimating how cruel Yuwen Taiji could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He’ll definitely kill them all if we don't show up! Dad, we can't wrong the Li Saint Clan like that!" Ye Shaoqing's eyes burned with passion as he looked in the direction of Fatepath Peak. The Li Saint Clan was the benefactor of the Ye Clan!
