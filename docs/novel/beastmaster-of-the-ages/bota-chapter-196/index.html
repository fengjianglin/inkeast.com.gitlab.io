 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the rest of the people left, only Tianming, Jingyu and Qingyu remained in Kunpeng Sacred Hall. The little chick and the awakened black cat were off fishing in the river. The aquatic creatures of the area would surely have nightmares of those two in the days to come. Jiang Feiling ended the Spiritual Attachment and left Tianming's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Tianming, even I have never seen anything like Ling'er's ability. She's definitely really precious to you. You’d better treat her well, since she went so far as to leave home to come with you. I'm really satisfied with my granddaughter-in-law, truly!" Jingyu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of them were willing to address the matter of Qingyu's marriage for now. Feiling, at being called 'granddaughter-in-law', blushed profusely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Granny, Big Brother treats me well," she said bashfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming froze. Even though he hadn't called Jingyu his grandma yet, Feiling had beat him to the punch. It was no wonder she was so lovable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good, very good," Jingyu said with her eyes glowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Will it get troublesome for us five days from now?" Tianming sternly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Well, it’ll no doubt be a little annoying. Those from the other three bloodlines are much harder to deal with than Li Linghe, and it'll take some effort before you lot can settle down here in peace. While the junior sect master position isn't that big a deal in the Grand-Orient Sect, those of the Li Saint Clan still pine for it. After all, millennia ago, that position represented the heir of the sect itself," Jingyu said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the position of heir to fall to a point where nobody really cared much about it was a stark contrast from what he had known in Vermillion Bird. Either way, Tianming was going to settle down in the sect. He was quite interested in the sect itself; after all, Fatepath Peak was but a small place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at that moment, a figure appeared in the hall, stumbling forwards towards them. "Tianming, my son, come, let daddy look at you! I looked away one moment, and you're already sixteen! Daddy really failed you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming turned to look at the person. He saw a man struggling to walk straight bumbling towards him with an anxious look. His hair was so messy it looked like he hadn't taken a bath for three whole months. All kinds of things stuck to his beard, including some still-evaporating alcohol. He held a jar of strong-smelling wine in one hand, but the smell on the man himself was even stronger than pure alcohol vapor. While his face was flushed from the alcohol, Tianming could see some black streaks underneath his skin, akin to miasma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black miasma crawled about like worms through his flesh. Tianming didn't need an introduction to know that this drunkard was none other than the current sect master, Li Wudi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ohh! My beautiful daughter got even prettier! Come, have a drink with daddy," he said as he stumbled over with a stupid smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qingyu merely gave him a glance and said, "Granny, I'm leaving first." She immediately turned to leave, as if she didn't want to say a word to Li Wudi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ling'er, help me ask Qingyu about her marriage," Tianming whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Okay."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He, Feiling, and Qingyu would be living in Kunpeng Sacred Hall from now on. Feiling was only a few years older than Qingyu, so she could probably console her somewhat and they were sure to become friends. With their departure, only Tianming, Jingyu and Li Wudi were left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My son, you’ve finally seen your dad after such a long time. I bet you're overwhelmed. Aren't you excited?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The smell of alcohol wafted nonstop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Darn it, don't tell me you didn't take a bath the whole time I was away!" Jingyu said, sighing and shaking her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Bathing? It's a waste of time, of life! Why would I take time away from my beloved drinking party with our ancestors?" he said, caught between a chuckle and stutter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at her pathetic son, Jingyu felt really troubled, but there was naught she could do. What in the world had the former top genius of the Grand-Orient Sect experienced to become such a hated sect master?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wudi's unfocused gaze fell on Tianming, as if he was checking him out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good! Come, let me see your five bane-rings." He tossed the jar to Tianming and approached him, casually raising Tianming's right arm and exposing it to the sunlight. "Wow, it's so cool! I feel the true power within! It's much cooler than my four bane-rings!" he said with awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming's expression darkened. Was he going to become this man's adopted son and address him as father in public?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Just address him using his whole name. Everyone in the sect does that anyway," Jingyu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What? So just call him Li Wudi?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He was still a senior, so Tianming wanted to at least show some respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Li Wudi let go of his arm and ruffled around in his clothes for a good long moment. Then, he took out a black ball-shaped object and said, "My son, I am really happy with how you turned out, so I'm giving this Kunpeng Sacred Seal to you! I’ve got your back from now on. The whole sect is my turf. You can do whatever you want, even beat up anyone you see! See a girl you like? Take her right there and there. Dad will establish a harem for you and let you enjoy all the luxuries life has to offer. If you like cultivation, go find your grandma. Manna, spirit ore, spirit herbs, beastial weapons, get my son all of them!" He drank as he spoke, then collapsed on the ground, completely out cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jingyu couldn't bear to see him like that and picked him up. Tianming noted that she didn't blame him at all for the sloppiness. Instead, her eyes were filled with hurt and regret. Normally, any mother would wish their child to aspire to be more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let me do it," Tianming said, helping her lift him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Help me take him back then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming carried him into Kunpeng Sacred Hall. It was a large hall, where their ancestors had been laid to rest. After he put Li Wudi down and left him to his sleep, Tianming saw that Jingyu was still staring at her son with a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He gave you the Kunpeng Sacred Seal." She seemed a little surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is it?" asked Tianming as he toyed around with the black object in his hand. It looked to be made of an odd material. It seemed like it could be jade and metal at the same time, yet it was soft to the touch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's a seal formed from the condensed blood of the clan's ancestors. It contains traces of the blood of the clan, all the way from the founding ancestor to my husband. Blood essence, if you will."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her husband was Li Wudi's father, and he had long passed away in Li Wudi's youth. Those of the Li Saint Clan's Apex Branch seldom lived long lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So, it's the condensed blood of countless ancestors of the clan?" Tianming seemed a little taken aback. To be honest, he found the burden of carrying it too heavy. He looked at the object and felt the accumulated will of countless heaven-defying experts. It was a legacy of the entire bloodline, something everyone yearned for! Only the greatest of clans would have an heirloom like that. Who would've thought that it had been hidden in Li Wudi's pockets, soaking up all the alcohol smell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right." The gaze Jingyu shot the seal was one of awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is the Kunpeng Sacred Seal good for anything?" Tianming curiously asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is the symbol of the sect master and junior sect master. The seal has been passed down since the ancient days of the Li Saint Clan. There are two of them, each infused in the blood of the sect master and junior sect master, respectively. Someone without the blood of the Li Saint Clan won't be able to assimilate it," she said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Will assimilating it increase my strength?" Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No, it won’t. But you need to have it on you for you to be allowed entry into the Li Mausoleum to pay respect to the ancestors."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In other words, as long as one can assimilate it, they’ll be recognized as the junior sect master without doubt, right?" Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So are there fortunes inside the mausoleum?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nope, but the others in the clan believe there is. However, they don't possess the blood of the Li Saint Clan, so they can't enter even if they have the Kunpeng Sacred Seal. If there were fortunes inside, our sect wouldn't have deteriorated for the past millennia."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So the whole point of condensing the blood of the ancestors is just for identification?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. That's why the three bloodlines are scrambling to go inside and take a look. After all, they never believe whatever we tell them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But I'm quite distantly related to the Li Saint Clan. Can I really assimilate this seal?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Distant or not, you’re a pentabane like the founding ancestor. There is a good chance it'll work."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then, can't I just become the junior sect master now by taking the seal in and destroying the plans of the other three bloodlines?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Theoretically it should work out that way, but I wouldn’t encourage you to do it before convincing the rest first."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Because once it’s assimilated, the seal will only come back out when you die, with the only difference being a drop of your blood will have been added to the blood essence."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So you're saying if I assimilate it without convincing them, they might kill me to retrieve the seal?" After all, the three bloodlines were targeting the position of the junior sect master and, by extension, the seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That’s what I expect will happen, but as long as I'm here, nobody can kill you. However, assimilating it will bring you beyond a point of no return. If the other three bloodlines aren't convinced, you'll be in a precarious position!" Jingyu's words were like an oath to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I see." He had already made up his mind. He smiled and asked, "So, how do I get started?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Make a cut at the part of your skin where the bane-rings are. The seal will enter your blood through the cut."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment she finished speaking, Tianming retrieved the Blazing Dragon Fang from his spatial ring and made a cut across his five bane-rings.</span></p>
