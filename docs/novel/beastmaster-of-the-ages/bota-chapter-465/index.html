 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh. How did Li Shenxiao enter then? He spent fifty years overcoming his Lifesbane,” Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Supposedly, it’s because overcoming it allowed him to become young again, thus circumventing the restriction,” Bai Mo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then can my godfather enter?” Tianming was surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unfortunately, no. I’ve checked. His Lifesbane is different from the traditional one. His Lifesbane never burnt away at his lifespan, so all of its effects were on his cultivation and not his age. Now, his body is over forty years old,” Bai Mo explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming had indeed noticed that Li Wudi hadn’t become younger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He made some quick calculations. He himself should be roughly thirty by now. Fortunately, he had a sensation of being rejuvenated when he became an earth saint, so he felt much younger. As for his looks, he looked seventeen or eighteen. Taken altogether, he shouldn’t be past thirty yet, hopefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why in the world would this god insist only people under thirty can enter?” Tianming didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s a little complicated. It’s because, for sky and empyrean saints, under thirty is considered to be the age where you have the most talent and the fastest progress. Once you pass it, you’ll slow down. And once you’re a hundred… that’s basically your peak. Then, when you hit a hundred and fifty, you’ll start deteriorating from age. While sky saints have an age limit of three hundred, you won’t really be all there anymore when you hit about two hundred and fifty.” Bai Mo smiled helplessly. No one could escape fate, and everyone would perish one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tianming, many people mistakenly believe that even if an expert dies from old age, they’ll still be powerful before death. That’s wrong, because aging is a slow process. Your cultivation will regress as all of your saint ki is slowly returned to the world. Your flesh will fail and eventually return to the earth. After a hundred years of that, you die. It’s sheer nonsense to expect an old man to still be able to have a big fight. For us humans, we spend the first half of our life taking from heaven and earth, and the latter half returning it.” Bai Mo shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming understood what he meant. If you didn’t die in battle, you would pass from age with white hair, wrinkles, a hunched back…. It wouldn’t matter what kind of expert you had once been.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming and his lustrous white hair full of health was the exception, not the rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Mo was now about a hundred years old. He looked to be in his forties—even younger than Wei Tiancang, who was in his sixties. He would probably look Wei Tiancang’s age when he hit a hundred and fifty. In fact, Bai Mo had already reached a point where his cultivation could no longer progress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why, while the Sky Saint stage gave you three hundred years, only the first hundred were truly comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Autarch Qian having children when he was three hundred was because he was equivalent to an ordinary person in their fifties. Another few years, and he would probably have been incapable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The laws of the world were merciless. The path to eternity was painful, and all experts would have to see their bodies slowly waste away as their strength left them. Even the Primeval Autarch was no exception!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That means Autarch Qian didn’t die of old age. As an empyrean saint, he’d just passed his peak period. He definitely had at least a hundred years left in him. Right now, he’s considered as suffering a premature death. But who knows what the cause was. Maybe he commited suicide from fear of death. Theocrats often do that, unwilling to endure their fall from grace.” Bai Mo gave a mocking laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his view, youths like Tianming wouldn’t understand. However, in truth, Tianming did indeed get it. He had just seized five years of life, after all. If he hadn’t succeeded, he would have been resigned to watching his beast ki fade away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hall King, can I enter the tomb?” Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’ll depend on your performance at the feast. Only the best can go in, and they’ll usually be at least twenty-six. Only special cases like Dongyang Fengchen, with his nine-headed hydra, can enter at twenty-two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t the Theocrats control the second Divine Capital? Why would they let us go in?” Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s because the Theocrats, and other powers of the capital, have already mixed into the dao palace. There was too much internal conflict when all of the Theocrats trained at the royal palace together. So, they purposely shifted all of the ones with the surname Jiang to us, in order to take our resources. Quite a few of them who joined us were quite strong, so the Theocrats gave them some slots, and the dao palace got some by association. But basically, it goes to them anyway.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The slots are determined by battle. It’s been that way for tens of thousands of years, so it’s pretty fair. However, the tomb has opened so many times that there aren’t really any treasures left, just some small toys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see.” Tianming nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go and ask the palace lord about her opinion. It’ll be difficult for you, as your opponents have a few years on you, so go train first. Right, and go get your empyrean manna.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood!” Tianming nodded. There wasn’t much to be concerned about, if the tomb was already cleared out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the crown prince to invite him to the feast, the situation couldn’t be so simple. There was definitely a trap somewhere. He didn’t believe the crown prince would be one of the good people in the Theocracy who would overlook his provocations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was still surprised. “That guy has a nine-headed hydra?” Such people, historically, were all capable of becoming Primeval Autarches. It was the reason Autarch Yun had immediately named him the crown prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems that, in terms of talent, Dongyang Zhuo must have been quite a bit poorer than this crown prince. At thirty, he’s already past the period of fastest progress. I wonder what stage he’s at now?” Tianming was curious. If there had been someone of the crown prince’s talent in his age group, he probably wouldn’t have become the strongest in his age group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whatever, I’ll go get the empyrean manna first!” Tianming split up from his companions and proceeded to the Dark Hall alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his first time in the Dark Hall’s area, but the guards all knew him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not bad, kiddo!” The uncles at the gate directly picked him up and tossed him in, giving him a very warm welcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know the way to the Sacred Dao Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look up, you see that mountain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right there on the peak, it is. Right, Li Tianming, remember to let us have a peek once you get an empyrean saint beast, as thanks for us saving you today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No problem!” Tianming had a good opinion of the Dark Hall, as they all valued loyalty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it wasn’t that people of the Decimo Dao Palace were good, while the Ancient Theocrats were bad. However, birds of a feather flock together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gods, it’s a celebrity! Come and give me your autograph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, your skin is so white! Let uncle rub it a little for good luck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost, don’t bully him! Big sister has your back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tianming, you’re going to see the palace lord? Help big brother here and report the fatty next door to me. His lifebound beast keeps shitting at my door, so please relocate him.”</span></p>
