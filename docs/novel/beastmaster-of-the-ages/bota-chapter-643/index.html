 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours later, Tianming emerged from the barrier, looking really haggard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Young man, how does it feel to take what it has to offer?" Ouyang Jianwang said, sitting with his legs crossed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Quite refreshing," Tianming said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wow, you're even boasting. Come and let me see if you managed to even absorb one strand of tribulation sword ki."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"One? That's impossible."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Weak," Ouyang Jianwang said derisively. "Young people these days are pathetic. They can't even take one bit of hardship. Back in my day, I—"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he managed to finish, he saw the dozen strands of tribulation sword ki in Tianming's hand. No, there were fifteen in total, each one stronger than his Myriad-Demise Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What the hell?! Why’d you pretend to fail?!" Ouyang Jianwang snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sorry, it's a habit."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Amazing. I knew my judgment wasn't mistaken.... Wait, were you only there for two hours? Doesn't that mean you could’ve absorbed even more if you had the time?" Ouyang Jianwang said, his mouth widening as the realization dawned on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Calm down, I say, calm down."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What in the world!" Ouyang Jianwang stumbled off his chair and looked at him blankly. If it went on like that, Tianming might stand a chance to top his record of ten thousand strands of tribulation sword ki!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The real reason behind Tianming's sudden increase in endurance was definitely thanks to his empyrean gold body, which allowed him to take on some of his Primordial Chaos Beasts' constitution. It took Ouyang Jianwang quite a while to accept that fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hear me out. You have to take the spot in the Deepstar Pool no matter what," Ouyang Jianwang said, suddenly sounding serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I want to see how many astralsources your body can take in."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Got it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There isn't much time left. You have to go back to the Deepstar Battlefield. From now on, come here to train the Tribulation Sword Body for two hours every day."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Understood. Thank you, Brother." Tianming bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Remember to bring wine and poems."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Tianming was headed to the Abyssal Battlefield, he ran into Fang Xingying. "Why are you out here? Have you been eliminated?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Xingying nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who did it? I’ll beat them up for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you certain?" Fang Xingying seemed a little nervous and pale as he crossed his arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean by that?" Something felt off to Tianming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Li Tianming, I heard you defeated Fang Chenyu. Everyone’s talking about how quickly you improve. I know your talent is definitely superior to even the Sterling House of Fang's Rainbow Phoenix Bloodline.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You have a good backing and lots of power. Not to mention, your relationship with Fang Xingque is past the point of no return, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shall I find a chance for you to kill him without anyone noticing? I promise I can arrange it without anyone finding out after the Deepstar Battle." His hands shook nervously as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming fell silent. "Do you hate him that much?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I do! Unbelievably so! Did you know? The Rainbow Phoenix Bloodline belongs to me! I am the true heir, but they took everything that belonged to me and gave it to Fang Xingque, and even forced my parents to die! I live only to avenge them. Please help me, I beg you!" Fang Xingying knelt and pleaded, as if Tianming was his only remaining lifeline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who are they?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Fang Taiqing and Fang Qingli, my grandmother! Hahaha! I hate them so very much!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why? Aren't you also a member of the Sterling House of Fang?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My father is only average, while Fang Taiqing is the sect master of the Heaven Branch. That’s why his son is thought to be far more suitable for the Rainbow Phoenix Bloodline. I was too dumb back then, and didn't know how to speak for myself. All seventeen years of my life, I've been living in a nightmare. I beg you, I beg you!" Fang Xingying said as he kowtowed nonstop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming was about to say that was too cruel, but he didn't. It was something in the past, and he wasn't the arbiter of what was cruel or not. Fang Xingying was just a pitiful person and Tianming couldn't empathize with him, not having experienced what he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Li Tianming, are you going to help me? I definitely won’t betray you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Just calm down for now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Calm down. I don't have much of a relationship with you, so asking me to kill the son of Heaven Branch’s sect master is a little too much. I need to think about it more first," Tianming said as he helped him up. While he did have some conflict with Fang Xingque, it wasn't to the point that he would kill him. He knew that Fang Taiqing had lots of power and influence in the Archaion Sect. Killing Fang Xingque would cause too much commotion. He and Feiling were currently in a rather perilous state, so they had to tread carefully every step of the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he didn't expect, however, was that Fang Xingying would push his hand away. "Li Tianming, you’re a coward! You also fear them! Everyone in this world is afraid of cruel people like them, including you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming felt his head start to hurt. "Actually, if you really want revenge, you should empty your mind first. You’ve fallen into despair, but there’s a lot of chances in life. Don't let yourself be mired in madness. If you can't even control yourself, only your enemy will benefit," Tianming said. This was something he had experienced before, so he knew how it felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha.... You and your empty words. Do you know what I’ve suffered?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Fang Xingying, think about it, is our relationship so close that I’d kill someone for your sake? You are not a child anymore. Try to be more mature." Tianming felt his rage building up. He didn't know what to say to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hehe.... Forget I said anything today. I misread your character," Fang Xingying said as he stood up and walked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming watched as he left. "There’s many avengers in this world. What they should really do is to try to control themselves first."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five days later on the Deepstar Battlefield, the last days of the battle were getting closer and closer. Tension was high in the audience and many didn't want to leave their seats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even now, Tianming was still keeping to his own pace. But to save time, he got rid of the powder on him so he wouldn't be pestered by Fang Xingque. What he did earned him quite a lot of mockery and laughter among the audience, who thought he was afraid despite his arrogant words days before, not that Tianming could hear any of it. He was really calm and did whatever he had to. He had been thinking about Fang Xingying for the past few days, wondering if he’d hurt him by turning him down so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Whatever, I'll stop thinking about it. I'm already in so much trouble, so I can't afford to get involved in other people's troubles." After finally letting it go, he felt much better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was cultivating within the battlefield. But before he made a final push, someone approached him from afar. Tianming saw a man accompanied by four women. The man seemed about as young as Fang Xingque and the rest, around sixteen or seventeen. He looked bright and handsome, and his slender figure was clad in a white robe. He seemed like a pretty boy whose beauty was hard to obscure despite his daintiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were four beauties around him, each of whom felt different from the others. One seemed mature and alluring, and the other was petite and cute. There was also a short-haired, handsome woman with a bombastic figure, and a quiet and gentle one whose gaze was really calming. Tianming almost couldn't take his eyes off the eye candy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those four pleasing women were protecting the young man in white, making for quite a rare sight. More importantly, all of them were Heaven Branch disciples. The aura of the Samsara stage was obvious and dense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They felt like sharp swords, so Tianming figured that they were from the Draconis House of Jian. Unlike Jian Xueyi, however, these were disciples who were able to join the Heaven Branch before the age of twenty. They must be core members of the house, otherwise they wouldn't look so impressive compared to normal Earth Branch disciples. As the disciples of the Draconis House of Jian maintained a rather low profile, Tianming didn't know who they were, but they definitely knew him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hey, don't run. Come make some friends," said the young man in a gentle, pleasing voice. As he spoke, they were already before Tianming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who are the other four?" Tianming asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They are all my girlfriends!" he said gleefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I see. It doesn't really matter to me. I think you’re a fine lad, so I wouldn't mind being your friend," Tianming said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after that, all of the girls pulled on the young man's ear, causing him to wince in pain. "Sorry, it's my fault! I’ll introduce you again!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they let go, he cleared his throat and said, "That was a joke, by the way. These are my godsisters. I’m their godbrother."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Ying Huo popped out of the lifebound space and said, "I could’ve sworn you guys are sleeping with each other."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh?!" All five of them glared at Ying Huo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm really sorry!" Tianming hurriedly said and stuffed Ying Huo back in his lifebound space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your birdie is really cute..." the young man awkwardly said, ignorant of the double entendre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Umm... so you are?" Tianming hurriedly changed the subject to avoid awkwardness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I’m Jian Lingchen. My father is the palace lord of Tribulation Artifact Hall, Jian Wufeng. My uncle tasked me to protect you. I know who you really are."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is your uncle Jian Wuyi?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Bingo! You got it right!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianming had seen Jian Lingchen's name before. He occupied the third spot on the rankings.</span></p>
