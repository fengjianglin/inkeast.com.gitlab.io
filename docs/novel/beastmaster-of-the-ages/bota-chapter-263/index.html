 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Xiaofu, are we near your hometown, Fuling Town, yet?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this full moon night, the Grandwhite Kunpeng had its wings spread in flight. Looking at it from the ground, it looked like there were two moons in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qingyu's ash-grey hair fluttered in the wind. Gradually, her hair color turned to that of the moon. However, nobody really paid attention to her, perhaps thanks to how attention-grabbing Tianming was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We'll be there soon. It's just across that mountain ahead," said a white-clad girl. She looked quite average with skin not as fair as Qingyu’s. Not to mention, there were a few scars on her face, signs of the many battles she had fought. Unlike the elders' descendants, she had relied on herself to become an inner disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Xiaofu, why do you look so downcast? Do you feel unwell?" Qingyu asked concernedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm fine," Guo Xiaofu said, hurriedly shaking her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's fine. Even though they kidnapped your parents, you said that they'd let them go after seeing a disciple from Grand-Orient Sect, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. My parents offended these bandits, but they heard that I was a disciple of the sect, so they didn't dare go overboard."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then it's fine. Don't worry. I’ve made some progress lately. I can deal with bandits on the fourth level of Unity for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you, Qingyu!" Xiaofu turned to her and looked a little distraught. Qingyu found it a little weird, but didn't think too much of it as Xiaofu had always been a worrywart. She was tough, but quite helpless at times, too. That was why they had been able to get along in the Wuyou Faction. There were many others who looked down on Qingyu for her background and mocked her abilities, despite being a member of the Apex Branch. Only Guo Xiaofu seemed to still hold some respect for the Li Saint Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To most of the other inner disciples, Guo Xiaofu's family background was indeed rather lowly. However, there was nobody else willing to train with Qingyu besides her. As Qingyu didn't have many friends to begin with, she cherished the few she had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after they flew past a mountain, Guo Xiaofu said, "We're here. Let's descend."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qingyu telepathically willed her kunpeng to glide downward. Soon, they reached the ground. When the kunpeng tucked its wings together, it beat up quite a lot of dust. Quite a number of trees shook under the moonlight, rustling rather audibly as if they were hiding quite a few figures in the dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's nobody here. Xiaofu, didn't you say that bandits occupied your hometown? This doesn't look like a town to me," she said when she saw the desolate place. For some reason, Guo Xiaofu's shoulders were shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qingyu, I'm sorry! I’ll pay you back what I owe in the next life!" she cried all of a sudden, sounding rather heartbroken as she ran away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at that moment, a young man in robes of gold suddenly burst out of the forest, wielding a two-pronged spear. He smirked as he blocked Guo Xiaofu's way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Li Xuanchen?" Qingyu felt a chill down her spine. It happened too fast, and she was rather disoriented. She couldn't figure out why he showed up here. Not to mention, his savage expression seemed to suggest he would be taking out his prey soon. What was worse was Guo Xiaofu had ran to him as she cried and suddenly knelt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Li Xuanchen! Tell Su Wuyou and the others that I did what I was told! I beg you... ask them to free my parents! Please!" she cried in despair. It was clear now what had happened. She didn't dare to look back at Qingyu, as she definitely understood what was happening by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please, I'm scared!" Guo Xiaofu slammed her head against the rocky ground before her as she begged. The sound of the slamming was really disturbing to Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So you threatened Xiaofu with her parents to lure me out? Li Xuanchen, what are you planning?" she said as she took Vilemoon out of her spatial ring. Ever since getting a new elder brother and awakening her talent, her state of mind had changed considerably. Despite knowing she had fallen into a trap, her first thought wasn’t to run or panic, but fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She glanced at Guo Xiaofu, feeling rather hurt at being reminded of what had happened to Li Wudi. The father and daughter had both been betrayed by the ones they were closest to. Even though Guo Xiaofu's parents were being used against her, Qingyu felt that she should've trusted her and asked her to help solve the problem. No matter what the reason, it felt horrible to be betrayed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the moonlight shone on her, her irises' color dimmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Li Qingyu, you should ask me that question instead!" said a soft, but sinister voice from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qingyu turned back immediately and saw a young boy. Despite his tall physique, he seemed to be rather young. His white robes fluttered in the air as he looked Qingyu down with a sinister gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yuwen Shengcheng?" she mouthed. Gripping Vilemoon even tighter, she armed her other hand with her three Crescent Spinblades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right, it's me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What are you planning?" she asked without a trace of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That apparently pissed him off. He was already itching to see her terrified, kneeling look, like how Guo Xiaofu was acting now. "I'm here for revenge. I want to pay you and Tianming back ten thousand times the pain I suffered! I want you to forever live in my shadow! I want to ruin your mind and make you my meat slave that dances at my every beck and call! You can't even die without my permission! From now until your death, you’ll be living in a nightmare. Only if you serve me well will I consider letting you catch a breath," he said, sounding more and more agitated as he approached her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scenes of his fight against Tianming and his father's disappointed expression flashed through his mind. Coupled with Qingyu's coldness, he felt the rage in his heart boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I think you're mistaken. You're the one who keeps messing with others. Nobody can realistically bully you. If anyone's to blame, it's your cowardice and overconfidence."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Jincan's wedding to the fight at the Imperial Ninefold Gates and the fight for the manna on the Abyssal Battlefield, he was the one who had started all of them, only to lose horribly. It was a shame that he would never admit that. He was the kind of person who would always be able to justify what he did to others to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shut up! How dare you look down on me? You're nothing but a pathetic member of the Apex Branch! Li Qingyu, I'd like to see if you still dare to act so defiant once I strip you naked!" He had grown more and more restless over the past few days. As far as he was concerned, he felt his dignity had been trampled on, and he really had to vent all that frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with such seething hate, Qingyu was still unmoved. "Someone like you doesn't even deserve to be in the Yuwen Clan. You're like a stray dog that can do nothing but whine."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuwen Shengcheng almost vomited blood from anger. The worst part of that insult was that it was on point. "Li Qingyu!" He took a fierce step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You don't scare me. Yuwen Shengcheng, since I'm already here, stop troubling Xiaofu and let her parents go. I'll leave with you." She gripped her blade and gave the girl another look. Such was life. The powerless couldn't do anything, no matter how hard they tried. Not everyone was so lucky to have a chance to challenge destiny. Most people were merely playthings of fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright. Guo Xiaofu, you may leave first," Li Xuanchen said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Xiaofu thought she had misheard. She thought Qingyu would hate her for it, yet she had taken it all herself and even wanted her to leave first, asking for her parents to be released on her behalf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qingyu...." She stood up, her tears flowing from her face nonstop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Xiaofu, it's fine. Go first—" Before she finished, a golden spear emerged from Guo Xiaofu's body, stained in red. It was a one-hit kill. Guo Xiaofu looked down as her vision started blurring. Stretching out her arms, she cried, "Qingyu... save me... I'm scared..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spear was audibly drawn back through her body. Guo Xiaofu looked fearfully at Qingyu and slumped to the ground, dying like a stray in an alley. Her lifebound beast charged forward in a panic, only to be intercepted by a Sixteen-winged Gold Kunpeng and an Eight-armed Taotie. They tore it in two halves, spilling rivers of blood.</span></p>
