 <p><strong>Chapter 858: The Last Time!</strong></p>
 <p>The Seventh Demon Sealing Hex was a magic unique to the League of Demon Sealers. It seemed similar to the Ji Clan’s Dao of Karma, but was fundamentally different. As he unleashed the magic, Meng Hao’s eyes gleamed with a strange light, and he looked around at all the magical items.</p>
 <p>Instantly, he was able to see numerous threads attached to the various magical items. These were none other than Karma Threads.</p>
 <p>All of the magical items had Karma Threads attaching them to the Warrior Pavilion, and now Meng Hao could see each and every one of them clearly.</p>
 <p>“So, even magical items can have Karma on them,” he thought. “Well, now I’m not so worried.” Clearing his throat, he glanced around craftily.</p>
 <p>“First, I’ll hex the Karma on these magical items, and then I’ll form a destiny connection with them!” Waving his hand, he caused the Seventh Demon Sealing Hex to cover all of the magical items in the Warrior Pavilion.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, bright light shot out in all directions, and the entire Warrior Pavilion began to shake.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s heart pounded as he waited for a few moments. Seeing that there was no further reaction, he relaxed a bit, then looked around craftily one more time.</p>
 <p>“The floor tiles here are excellent,” he thought, licking his lips. “Later on, I think I’ll pry up a few to take with me. And the wood those shelves are made from is anything but ordinary….</p>
 <p>“Those decorative tiles are nice too!” His eyes shone brightly as he took a deep breath.</p>
 <p>He quickly performed an incantation gesture, causing Karma Threads to appear on top of his head. These were his own personal Karma Threads, which glittered with resplendent colors. Meng Hao settled his qi and calmed his mind, then searched through his Karma Threads until he found one that seemed to be on the verge of fading away.</p>
 <p>That Karma Thread was the one that had been created when he first laid eyes on the spear moments ago. Of course, the thread was incredibly thin, as if even a slight breeze would cause it to scatter.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao took a deep breath, then lifted his hand and pointed out toward that particular thread. Instantly, the Karma Thread twisted into the shape of a magical symbol, which then descended into Meng Hao’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Bind destiny!” he said. Instantly, the thread began to glitter with radiant light. At the same time, the spear began to tremble, as if it were struggling against something.</p>
 <p>As it fought, the Karma thread attached to Meng Hao’s head that represented the spear suddenly grew very clear. Now it seemed to be even more closely attached to Meng Hao, as if the Karma between the two of them was growing deeper.</p>
 <p>“A Writ of Karma! Bind destiny!” Meng Hao’s eyes shone with bright light, and he let out a bellow. The magical symbol on his right hand began to glitter radiantly as he crushed it. A boom rattled out as the magical symbol shattered. In the moment that it dispersed, the spear ceased struggling, and Meng Hao could suddenly feel something like a summons, echoing out from the spear.</p>
 <p>Unable to withhold his excitement, he stretched his hand out into the air. The spear immediately flew through the air with a screaming whistling sound and landed directly in his hand</p>
 <p>Meng Hao laughed out loud.</p>
 <p>“Mine! All of the magical items here are mine now!” Even as excitement filled his heart, suddenly, a murderous aura surged toward him from behind.</p>
 <p>The aura was so intense that it seemed capable of destroying him in body and spirit by merely brushing against him.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s face fell, and he jerked his head around. However, there was nobody behind him. The murderous aura was still there, though; apparently it came from the Warrior Pavilion itself.</p>
 <p>Cold sweat dripped down Meng Hao’s face, and he didn’t dare to move. The murderous aura filled him with intense nervousness, and he began to edge his way toward the door. The murderous aura followed him as he went, as if it were attempting to intimidate him.</p>
 <p>“I was just creating some ties of destiny!” Meng Hao said quickly. “What are you flipping out for?” After a moment, he continued, “Uhh… a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding. Warrior Pavilion, my brother, this was all just a misunderstanding, alright?” The murderous aura seemed as intense as ever.</p>
 <p>After a long moment, though, Meng Hao sensed that the aura was dissipating. Seeing that it hadn’t attacked him, his eyes darted around. He had half a mind to leave, but when he saw all the magical items around him in the Warrior Pavilion, he just couldn’t make himself do it.</p>
 <p>“Warrior Pavilion, my brother, don’t pay any attention to me!” he called out loudly. “I’m fine here by myself. You get back to whatever it was you were doing, alright?” With that, he carefully sidled over to the sword covered with black blood.</p>
 <p>Ever-vigilant of the murderous aura, he quickly used A Writ of Karma to find the Karma Thread that connected him to the sword, then bound the destiny as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>The sword trembled, and the murderous aura from the Warrior Pavilion exploded out. Cold beads of sweat broke out on Meng Hao’s forehead, but he gritted his teeth and used Ties of Destiny a few more times. After the third time, the sword stopped struggling, and an invisible connection formed between the two of them.</p>
 <p>The sword flew out and began to swirl around Meng Hao like a dragon.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao had no time to rejoice as the Warrior Pavilion’s murderous aura exploded in intensity throughout the entire pavilion. It seemed to be incensed, and matchlessly fierce.</p>
 <p>“That was the last time!” said Meng Hao. “The last time!”</p>
 <p>He then licked his lips and stood in place, not daring to move for a long moment, after which he cautiously inched over toward a magical jade flower. Gritting his teeth, he immediately slammed A Writ of Karma into the magical flower. A magical symbol appeared; this flower was apparently different from the other magical items, and he succeeded on his first try.</p>
 <p>Almost immediately, the shocking murderous aura caused everything to tremble violently. Meng Hao’s entire body was now soaked with sweat.</p>
 <p>“That was the last time!” he cried out urgently. “I promise, that was really the last time!</p>
 <p>“Warrior Pavilion, my brother, it was really the last time. I’m taking off now, see you!” The intensity of the murderous aura caused Meng Hao’s face to grow pale, and his heart to tremble. Even as he spoke, he quickly began to walk toward the exit.</p>
 <p>However, after only a few steps, he couldn’t help but use Ties of Destiny on a little bottle he saw on a nearby shelf. It was blackish-green, and although it seemed unremarkable, Meng Hao could sense a boundless aura emanating off of it.</p>
 <p>“Dammit!” he thought, gnashing his teeth. At the same time, he found the Karma Thread connecting him to the bottle and used it to make a magical symbol. As soon as the symbol landed in his hand, he crushed it and, without taking the time to check whether or not he had succeeded, quickly grabbed the little bottle.</p>
 <p>As soon as his hand wrapped around it, his body flashed toward the Warrior Pavilion’s exit. At the same time, the murderous aura exploded toward Meng Hao at an incredible speed, and a faint roar of rage could be heard echoing about.</p>
 <p>“The last one!” he cried. “That was really, really the last one. I’m going now, I’m going now!” Meng Hao’s scalp was numb as he shot forward. Behind him, the murderous aura swept toward him as if to drive him out.</p>
 <p>Next to the door was the table he had seen earlier. As he passed, he couldn’t stop himself from reaching out to grab a jade slip he saw sitting there.</p>
 <p>That seemed to push the murderous aura of the Warrior Pavilion past the limits of its patience. It transformed into an explosive attack that shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>A faint howl could be heard from within the murderous aura: “Get the hell out of here!”</p>
 <p>When it smashed into Meng Hao, blood sprayed from his mouth, and he was flung toward the door like a kite with its string cut.</p>
 <p>The door slammed open, and Meng Hao was thrown out, whereupon the door slammed shut again.</p>
 <p>Almost immediately, the Warrior Pavilion began to fade away. At the same time, the scene was now clearly visible to the Patriarchs of the Three Great Daoist Societies up in the starry sky palace, as well as the Patriarchs from the other sects.</p>
 <p>On the screen, they saw Meng Hao flying out, blood spraying from his mouth, his expression one of incredible determination. From the look of it, he had been willing to look death calmly in the face in order to complete the task assigned to him, and had been willing to pay any cost.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao coughed up another mouthful of blood and then cried out, “Fang Mu of the junior generation, despite facing great personal injury and near death, went through hell and high water to accomplish the mission given to him by the mighty Three Great Daoist Societies!” With that, he produced the Feng Shui compass and held it aloft.</p>
 <p>It was a very moving image. Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth, and his face was pale white. His body trembled, and he was clearly very seriously injured. His words, and the image he presented, instantly moved the three Patriarchs from the Three Great Daoist Societies.</p>
 <p>The three Patriarchs were panting, and were completely incapable of controlling the wild exuberance they felt in their hearts.</p>
 <p>It was at this exact moment that the pale-faced Ling Yunzi suddenly materialized in front of Meng Hao. He immediately made a grasping gesture with his right hand, and the Feng Shui compass in Meng Hao’s hand flew over to him. He nodded to Meng Hao, and then sighed inwardly with emotion. He himself had just been injured by the light from the Warrior Pavilion, and knew how dangerous it could be. When he saw the injuries Meng Hao had received, he was filled with sympathy. Then he noticed Meng Hao’s solemn and stirring facial expression, and he suddenly had the feeling the things that had previously occurred between the two of them must have been misunderstandings.</p>
 <p>“What a good kid!” he said. “Here, take this medicinal pill. It’ll take care of those injuries!” Moved, he waved his right hand, causing a white medicinal pill to fly out and hover in front of Meng Hao. Because of his skill in the Dao of alchemy, Meng Hao could tell from the medicinal aroma of the pill that it was definitely a treasured pill.</p>
 <p>“It’s too bad I can’t duplicate it right here and now,” Meng Hao thought. He quickly accepted the pill and then put it into his bag of holding.</p>
 <p>“I think you should eat it now,” said Ling Yunzi, looking concerned. “Those injuries are quite serious.”</p>
 <p>Inwardly, Meng Hao chuckled bitterly. He had no desire whatsoever to consume the medicinal pill. All he needed to do was activate his Eternal stratum, and he would recover almost immediately. However, Ling Yunzi’s was staring right at him, so Meng Hao endured the pain of his loss, clenched his teeth, and finally consumed the pill.</p>
 <p>As soon as the medicinal pill dissolved into him, a warm current filled his body, and all of his injuries were healed.</p>
 <p>“What a loss,” he thought. “What a terrible loss. If I could have duplicated that medicinal pill, I could have sold it later for an exorbitant price.” Inwardly, he was laughing bitterly, but on the outside he put on an expression of appreciation as he clasped hands and bowed toward Ling Yunzi.</p>
 <p>Ling Yunzi nodded again. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that Meng Hao was among the best of the best, both in terms of cultivation base and intuition, not to mention fate.</p>
 <p>“I really misunderstood him in the matter of the latent talent and those other stages,” Ling Yunzi thought.</p>
 <p>Smiling broadly, he then said, “Fang Mu, are you willing to become a Conclave disciple of the Nine Seas God World?!”</p>
 <p>In response to the words, the Patriarchs in the starry sky palace all looked on with glittering eyes.</p>
 <p>The Patriarch from the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite smiled faintly, a smiled that contained abstruse meaning. The Patriarch from the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto hesitated for a moment. As for the Patriarch from the Nine Seas God World, he laughed out loud.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao gaped for a moment, and was thinking about refusing. Then he thought about how funny it would be if he joined the Nine Seas God World under his assumed name Fang Mu, considering that Fan Dong’er was also a member.</p>
 <p>He cleared his throat and clasped hands.</p>
 <p>“Junior is willing,” he replied. “Unfortunately, I have a few random matters that I have to take care of. If senior is willing to give me a bit of time to handle those affairs, then when I’m finished, I will immediately go to the Nine Seas God World.”</p>
