 <p><strong>Chapter 494: I am Lonelytomb</strong></p>
 <p>In the very moment that the slaughter began, when ten of the sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators were killed, two of the remaining six, the retreating late Nascent Soul old men, exchanged a glance. Their eyes were bloodshot, and they could see the frenzy in each other’s eyes.</p>
 <p>They both performed incantations, spit out blood, and the pointed down toward the ground, their expressions savage.</p>
 <p>“Activate the spell formation!”</p>
 <p>Instantly, a deafening roar could be heard coming from the ground. The mist roiled, and the twenty thousand auction participants surrounded by the mist began to wither rapidly. Their life force was still being congealed into the Demonic Qi. Suddenly, bands of bright light started to appear on the ground.</p>
 <p>The bands bent and twisted and then suddenly connected together to reveal an enormous spell formation!</p>
 <p>It was exactly the same spell formation Meng Hao had observed earlier, although previously, it had been formed only of Demonic Qi. As it became visible, a column of black mist suddenly shot up in the exact center.</p>
 <p>One of the Eight Branch Alliance’s late Nascent Soul Cultivators shouted, “Crow Divinity Tribes, since you’re looking to die, then the Eight Branch Alliance will help you achieve your aim! Henceforth, there will be no Crow Divinity Tribe in the Western Desert! All of you… will be destroyed in spirit and body! You will be expunged!”</p>
 <p>A roaring sound filled the air as the black column shrank in on itself and transformed into a black figure.</p>
 <p>“Sacred Ancient,” said the second late Nascent Soul Cultivator, his face covered with a vicious expression, “please exterminate these people! Expunge this Tribe!” At the same time, totem tattoos depicting faces appeared on the foreheads of all the Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators on the ground. There was one expression that covered each and every one of those faces.</p>
 <p>Awe!</p>
 <p>All the totemic faces were filled with intense awe, as well as enmity. Clearly, though, no matter how much hatred they felt, they were incapable of not feeling deep awe for the figure which had coalesced out of the black column of mist.</p>
 <p>Tens of thousands of voices suddenly caused Heaven and Earth to shake: “Sacred Ancient, please, let your projection come to exterminate these people! Expunge this Tribe!”</p>
 <p>The figure that had congealed out of the mist floated in mid-air. At first it looked blurry, but its features quickly clarified into that of a middle-aged man wearing a black robe. His face was expressionless, and he exuded an archaic aura. After having appeared, he flickered back and forth between being clear and being blurry. Sometimes he would even momentarily disappear before becoming clear again.</p>
 <p>This flickering back and forth caused all the Cultivators who looked at him to have a very strange feeling. Their hearts were filled with disorder, and their eyes felt stabbing pain.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao took a deep breath. As of this moment, the calling inside of him grew incredibly strong. Furthermore, the Demon Sealing Jade inside of his bag of holding was beginning to shake.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was well aware that this figure was what had been concealed in the center of the spell formation, and was also what had elicited the reaction from the Demon Sealing Jade.</p>
 <p>The black-robed man turned his head, and his eyes came to fall upon Meng Hao. Instantly, Meng Hao’s mind filled with a roaring sound, and his vision swam. He no longer saw the Western Desert. Instead, he stood in a world with a red sky. He was in the middle of a battlefield, surrounded by wailing and shouting. He saw a black spear, shooting with incredible speed directly toward him.</p>
 <p>His mind and heart trembled, and he had the sudden sensation that they were shattering. Suddenly, his eyes went wide as a finger appeared directly in front of him. The finger belonged to the black-robed man.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>In the moment of ultimate crisis, Eyeless Larva spun around him rapidly. The incoming finger attack slammed into it, and, in the resulting boom, Meng Hao tumbled backward several hundred meters, blood spraying from his mouth. He came to a stop and then looked up. His eyes narrowed, and a cold glow erupted out from within them.</p>
 <p>At the same, up in the invisible vortex, in the world filled with corpses, the black mist on top of the high altar suddenly began to churn. An anxious, indignant howl suddenly echoed out from it.</p>
 <p>As the howling echoed out, the expressions on the countless faces of Cultivators and neo-demons in the mist suddenly changed. They distorted and twisted, as if some unknown force was suppressing the howling within the mist.</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, the expression on the face of the black-robed man who stood up ahead from Meng Hao also flickered. He looked up toward the vortex, his eyes flashing. Then he looked back toward Meng Hao, and a strange glow could be seen in his eyes.</p>
 <p>It appeared to be a look of disbelief. Even more than disbelief, there was apparently an unprecedented excitement and greed.</p>
 <p>At the same time, one of the remaining six Nascent Soul Cultivators up in mid-air, an old man of the mid Nascent Soul stage, having seen Meng Hao forced back by the black-robed man’s finger attack, excitedly shouted, “Sacred Ancient, please exterminate this vicious, cruel Cultiva….”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish speaking, the black-robed man’s right hand suddenly shot up to form a claw, which he pointed toward the mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivator. The old man suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, he was shocked to find that the black-robed man’s hand was wrapped around his neck.</p>
 <p>“Pipe down,” said the Black Robed man, his voice cool. He squeezed his hand, and a cracking sound could be heard. The mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivator’s eyes went wide as his body instantly withered up. His life force was sucked out by the black-robed man, and in the blink of an eye, he was transformed into nothing more than a desiccated corpse. His eyes were wide open the entire time, and filled with confusion. In the end, a poof could be heard as his body transformed into black ash. He was completely dead, in both body and spirit.</p>
 <p>“He… is not someone you qualify to dishonor with your words,” said the black-robed man, his voice soft as he looked at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Everything suddenly became quiet. The Crow Divinity Tribe members and neo-demons all began to back up. The Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators were stupefied. Suddenly sapped of their will to fight, they edged backward. All eyes were now upon Meng Hao and the black-robed man, both of whom floated there in mid-air.</p>
 <p>The remaining five Nascent Soul Cultivators of the Eight Branch Alliance had pale faces. In their recollection, the Sacred Ancient never seemed to possess consciousness. His incisive attacks were almost like that of a puppet. He also never spoke. But today… not only did he speak, but his expression had changed, and he even seemed to be showing emotion. This was beyond anything they had ever imagined, completely unprecedented. They were scared witless, and couldn’t help but back up.</p>
 <p>The black-robed man smiled and continued, “Isn’t that right, <em>exalted</em> Demon Sealer?”</p>
 <p>His smile was filled with savagery, as well as excitement. The excitement apparently made the flickering of his body even more intense, causing him to look even more bizarre.</p>
 <p>The black mist on the altar within the vortex once again churned. The howling sound grew more furious, as if something wished to burst out from within the mist. Despite that, the faces still seemed capable of suppressing it.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s expression was the same as ever, but inside, he was trembling, as if great waves were slamming against his heart. What was the most shocking of all to him was that he had finally run into someone who instantly recognized that he was a Demon Sealer.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” asked Meng Hao, staring at the man.</p>
 <p>“Who am I? You’re asking me who I am?” The black-robed man stared in shock for a moment, and then suddenly laughed. It was an uproarious laughter filled with excitement, as well as a greed that even the Cultivators of the Eight Branch Alliance could also see.</p>
 <p>“You’re actually asking who I am?” he asked, continuing to laugh. “You don’t recognize me? Don’t tell me the First Generation Demon Sealer severed the legacy? Don’t tell me….” Suddenly, an arrogant squawk could be heard from behind him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me nothin', bitch!” A multicolored blur suddenly appeared, which headed straight toward the rear end of the black-robed man and… shot directly through.</p>
 <p>A pop could be heard as the parrot suddenly appeared on Meng Hao’s shoulder. It glared fiercely at the black-robed man.</p>
 <p>“You’re just a Devil Construct, bitch! Dammit! Bitch! Lord Fifth hates Devil Constructs!”</p>
 <p>Not willing to be outdone by the parrot, the meat jelly, who was still in the shape of a bell attached to the parrot’s foot, suddenly cried, “Lord Third also hates Devil Constructs! All Devil Constructs should be converted!”</p>
 <p>The black-robed man stared in shock. He looked down at his misty body, and then looked back up, his eyes filled with the desire to kill.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that another furious cry could be heard from behind the black-robed man: “Outlander!”</p>
 <p>The enormous Outlander Beast, in a fair imitation of the parrot, shot directly toward the black-robed man.</p>
 <p>Even as it closed in, however, the black-robed man waved his arm behind him and coldly said, “Demonic Shattering.”</p>
 <p>He only spoke two words, but in response, massive amounts of invisible Demonic Qi from the surrounding area shot toward him and congealed in front of his right hand. Then, it shattered.</p>
 <p>The Outlander Beast let out a miserable shriek as nearly half of its body was shredded into a haze of blood and gore. It appeared to be on the verge of being completely wiped out.</p>
 <p>“Beloved concubine!” cried the parrot, its eyes bright red. It suddenly shot forward, its body expanding until it was several dozen meters long. It shot toward the black-robed man, then passed through him, picking up the Outlander Beast flying rapidly off into the distance in retreat.</p>
 <p>The black-robed man did not counterattack. Instead, he looked coldly at Meng Hao, smiling as he began to move forward.</p>
 <p>“I never imagined that I would meet the current generation of the Demon Sealers…. After I consume you, who else could possibly suppress me!?”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s heart trembled. His opponent’s aura was monstrous, and emanated shocking ripples. Meng Hao could feel an intense pressure weighing down on him. Panting, he stared at the black-robed man. Just now, everyone else had seen the black-robed man simply lift his hand to cause the Outlander Beast to suddenly shatter into a mass of blood and gore.</p>
 <p>Only Meng Hao clearly saw what really happened. This was a new way to use Demonic Qi that he had never seen before!</p>
 <p>“So Demonic Qi… can actually be used like that!” It felt like lightning was crashing around inside of his head. It seemed as if the black-robed man’s divine ability had suddenly opened up the door to a new Dao belonging to Demon Sealers.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao suddenly began to retreat. At the same time, the black-robed man increased his speed, his expression of viciousness and greed more visible than ever.</p>
 <p>“A Demon Sealer separated from his legacy! You would do well to remember my name…. I am Lonelytomb!” The instant the man spoke out his name, the mist in the vortex suddenly emitted a furious shriek. It seemed that it was struggling to burst out; nonetheless, the faces seemed willing to be destroyed to prevent it from escaping.</p>
