 <p>The Fourth Hex, Self Hexing!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was a blur as he shot toward Allheaven. In the time it took to blink, innumerable afterimages appeared. There were men and women, old and young, all of whom looked different from Meng Hao, and yet were fundamentally the same.</p>
 <p>That was because they were all clones produced by Meng Hao’s Self Hex!</p>
 <p>The Self Hex could produce countless numbers of clones, entire worlds of life. It could transform Heaven and Earth, and could make the true form become an entire country!</p>
 <p>A hundred clones appeared. Then thousands. Then tens of thousands.</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as all the different versions of Meng Hao closed in on Allheaven’s clone. Meng Hao waved his hand, and all of his clones waved their hands. The joint attack was like a tempest, shattering the starry sky, powerful enough to wipe out all living beings.</p>
 <p>Allheaven’s clone hovered there, hair whipping wildly around his head. He was aware that he wasn’t a match for Meng Hao’s Self Hex in this state. After all, this was a clone, not his true self. Not even this clone could handle Meng Hao, who was half a step into the Ancestor Realm.</p>
 <p>A boom rang out, and Allheaven fell back, coughing up blood. However, his eyes shone with cold light, and his expression was ferocious as he stared at Meng Hao’s clones, all of whom possessed the same Essences as he did. All of a sudden, a look of focus appeared in Allheaven’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Fourth Allheaven Transformation!” he roared. “Devil Soul Transformation!”</p>
 <p>Even as the words left his mouth, his expression distorted, becoming more ferocious than ever. Cracking sounds rang out as razor-sharp bone spurs pierced out through his flesh all over his body. His head also changed, as two long horns grew out.</p>
 <p>Scales rippled out to cover his flesh, and at the same time, Devil fire burst out, black flames that scorched everything around him.</p>
 <p>Allheaven’s clone had completely changed, and was now wreathed in raging black flames. He was merely 300 meters tall at this point, but as he hovered there, the Devil qi which swirled around him seemed capable of covering the entire starry sky. The sea of flames which surrounded him raged as he pushed one hand up above him, as if to support the Heavens above, and the other hand down, as though to brace against all the Earth below. Then, he began to take seven steps forward.</p>
 <p>It was as if in all Heaven and Earth, he was the most supreme of all beings!</p>
 <p>He was the Devil!</p>
 <p>Within Allheaven’s starry sky of the Vast Expanse, the Devil was the second person to ever Transcend. He was the basis of the fourth transformation, the Devil Soul Battle Form!</p>
 <p>Allheaven looked up, his face expressionless, and the sea of flames churned. His eyes were crimson, his expression merciless, as if he were willing to consume anything and everything. He apparently lost command of all faculties of reason, and instantly descended into madness.</p>
 <p>“DIIIIEEEEEEEEE!” he howled, turning into a blur and appearing directly in front of Meng Hao. There, he clenched his hand into a fist and punched out.</p>
 <p>That fist carried with it the sea of flames, a destructive blast of fire backed by the starry sky itself. It was as if the entire world were packed into that fist, and the sheer power caused Meng Hao’s pupils to constrict. He could sense that this fourth Allheaven Transformation was explosively more powerful than the others.</p>
 <p>It was also incredibly fast. Meng Hao waved his sleeve out in front of him, which was mimicked by all of his countless clones. A blast surged out which then converged onto the image of the Devil.</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>This stretch of the starry sky had long since turned into a shattered battleground as the void was repeatedly shredded and destroyed by the fighting.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao and Allheaven fought back and forth like mad, wreaking such havoc on their surroundings that it seemed as if the starry sky might not be able to handle it for much longer.</p>
 <p>The full power of Meng Hao’s Self Hex unleashed countless clones that put him on almost equal footing with Allheaven. Allheaven, the Devil embodied, threw his head back and howled, a howl filled with madness that could pierce through everything. “Unbridled Devil Will!”</p>
 <p>At the same time, a divine sense erupted out that could shake Heaven and Earth. It smashed down toward Meng Hao, filled with madness, murder, and blood. When it slammed into him, his face flickered; even with his Transcendent soul, it was actually difficult to withstand the power of the divine sense.</p>
 <p>Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth as he backed up. This was his first time sustaining an injury during this battle with Allheaven.</p>
 <p>In that same moment, the eyes of the Allheaven Devil turned an even deeper red. Howling, he charged once more in attack.</p>
 <p>“Underworld Possession!” As the words echoed out, the Allheaven Devil transformed into countless black strands which sped through the air. Before Meng Hao could react, they bored into his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, as if to possess him.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao took a deep breath, then stretched his arms out wide.</p>
 <p>“Self Hex! All creation becomes me!” Instantly, countless versions of Meng Hao appeared around him, different from him, and yet containing his Essence. There were so many that they were impossible to count, stretching in all directions.</p>
 <p>“Starry sky, thou shalt become my body!” The destroyed starry sky in the area twisted, becoming almost like a mirror that cast countless reflections, making it seem as if the starry sky itself were made up of clones of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Where I stand, there doth exist my kingdom!” His eyes snapped open, and they shone like the sun. He lifted his right foot into the air, and stamped it down violently!</p>
 <p>Instantly, the starry sky teetered.</p>
 <p>“Children of the kingdom, unite to protect mine soul!” He took a deep breath, and as he did, the entire void around him was affected, as everything collapsed into ruin.</p>
 <p>It was as if a giant had sucked in a breath, except there was no giant, only Meng Hao. That single breath caused everything in the area to be completely destroyed.</p>
 <p>Along with the destruction, Meng Hao’s Essence clones transformed into beams of light that shot inside of him. The shattered starry sky, his kingdom, everything else that came from the Self Hex, all fused back into him.</p>
 <p>Golden light exploded out from within him, until he looked like he was made of gold. Suddenly, he seemed as invincible as a fortress. His soul was now under the protection of countless Self Hex clones, ensuring that the Devil’s possession attempt was doomed to failure.</p>
 <p>“Begone from me!” Meng Hao roared. The countless black threads which had bored into him were violently forced out. His body was like a battleground, within which the Devil was completely vanquished and removed.</p>
 <p>However, even as the black Devil threads were blasted away, a voice echoed out like that belonging to a divine being. It was as powerful as thunder, like the voice of a deity that could cause all living things to tremble.</p>
