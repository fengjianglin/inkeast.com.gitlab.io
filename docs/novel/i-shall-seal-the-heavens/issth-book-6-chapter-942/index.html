 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>Seven days later, Planet East Victory had returned to its usual state. The rising of the East Ascension Sun was now a thing of the past. However, because of the amazing display of the acquisition of good fortune, the name Fang Hao rose to new heights.</p>
 <p>All of the Fang Clan was talking about Fang Hao, and the name also began to spread to the rest of Planet East Victory.</p>
 <p>He had a 30,000-meter Bloodline Gatebeam!</p>
 <p>He dominated the Medicine Pavilion all the way to the seventh level!</p>
 <p>He concocted… one of the three sacred pills, the Skypalace Sunspirit Pill!</p>
 <p>He had a true Immortal fleshly body!</p>
 <p>He stepped out into the starry sky to face the sun!</p>
 <p>Word spread of Meng Hao’s various deeds, and the Fang Clan was completely shaken. Other cultivators on Planet East Victory now viewed Meng Hao as a blazing sun of the Fang Clan.</p>
 <p>During that entire time, Meng Hao remained cross-legged in meditation up in the starry sky. Facing the sun had been a shocking type of good fortune for him, especially when he saw the Ninth Mountain eclipse it. That image thoroughly shook him inwardly.</p>
 <p>He contemplated enlightenment for seven days, during which time his body shone with bright light. When the light spread out, shockingly, his Dharma Idol appeared behind him.</p>
 <p>The Dharma Idol was 21,000 meters tall, and when the direct bloodline clan members saw it, they stared.</p>
 <p>That was because almost as soon as it appeared, the Dharma Idol started to grow!!</p>
 <p>At the same time, Meng Hao’s Immortal meridian grew even more solid. Apparently, this period of enlightenment was pushing Meng Hao even closer to true Immortality.</p>
 <p>Time passed, three more days. Meng Hao’s entire body radiated brilliant light, and his Dharma Idol was no longer 21,000 meters tall, but rather 22,500 meters.</p>
 <p>Such height was equivalent to an Immortal Realm cultivator with 75 opened meridians, and immediately lifted the spirits of the direct bloodline clan members.</p>
 <p>Five more days passed. Meng Hao had now been contemplating enlightenment for half a month. At that point, more light exploded out from him, and his Dharma Idol grew from 22,500 meters to 24,000 meters!</p>
 <p>A Dharma Idol like that could shake Heaven and Earth, and caused the direct bloodline clan members to stare in excitement.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was now equivalent to an Immortal Realm cultivator with eighty opened meridians. That was a level of the Immortal Realm achievable only by Inner Sect disciples of certain sects.</p>
 <p>“He still hasn’t even become a true Immortal, and he’s already comparable to those Inner Sect disciples!”</p>
 <p>“All of you, look closely…. Hao’er’s Dharma Idol… has no Immortality Illumination Vine on it!!”</p>
 <p>The direct bloodline clan members’ hearts trembled as they peered at Meng Hao, and then voiced expressions of disbelief.</p>
 <p>“He’s not using an Immortality Illumination Vine. Could it be… could it be that he’s walking his own path to true Immortality!?!?”</p>
 <p>“Walking one’s own path to Immortality is incredibly difficult! But look, his Dharma Idol is already 24,000 meters tall!!”</p>
 <p>“The direct bloodline is destined to rise again!”</p>
 <p>It was at this point that Meng Hao slowly regained his senses and opened his eyes. Within his mind flashed images of everything he had learned from the sun regarding natural law. In that moment, they suddenly fused together into a divine ability.</p>
 <p>His enlightenment of the sun, and the sight of the Ninth Mountain eclipsing it, allowed him to create yet another divine ability, his third!</p>
 <p>He slowly lifted his hand, within which appeared a spark of light. The light became a sphere, which then sucked in all the heat in the area, causing Meng Hao’s appearance to ripple and distort.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Meng Hao was awakening initially caused the direct bloodline members to get very excited. However, their faces quickly fell and they backed away.</p>
 <p>They had just noticed that their entire bodies had become icy cold in a very short period of time, as if all the heat was being sucked out of them.</p>
 <p>Even more shocking was that the entirety of Planet East Victory was apparently affected. Countless streams of heat rose up from the ground, from all living beings on the planet.</p>
 <p>The amorphous heat caused everything to distort as it shot toward Meng Hao. His expression was calm as he observed the scene; from the look in his eyes, it seemed that he was still sunk in contemplation.</p>
 <p>The sphere of light in his hand continued to suck in the heat, faster and faster. In the end, he raised his hand, and the sphere reached a size of thirty meters. Within the sphere circulated brilliant light that emitted a shocking aura.</p>
 <p>The aura seemed to increase in strength as it absorbed heat until it even began to absorb light.</p>
 <p>The sphere grew larger and its aura grew more intense. All of the light and heat around Meng Hao was being absorbed, leaving everything ice cold….</p>
 <p>Down below on Planet East Victory, the effects were even more noticeable. Gradually, the temperature on the entire planet began to drop.</p>
 <p>Not only that, everything started to get darker. Powerful experts all over Planet East Victory noticed, and instantly sent divine sense out to investigate the cause. Soon, they saw Meng Hao, and the enormous sphere of light above him, now several hundred meters wide.</p>
 <p>It looked like a small sun, and anyone who saw it was left feeling shocked. The aura it contained was mad and brutal, and… truly made any onlookers feel as if they were looking at the sun!!</p>
 <p>After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, Planet East Victory’s temperature dropped further, and it got even darker. The globe of light was now over 3,000 meters wide, and caused anyone who looked at it to feel a sense of impending crisis.</p>
 <p>If the energy inside the globe were to explode out, it would leave even experts of the Ancient Realm astonished and pale-faced.</p>
 <p>Most shocking of all, it appeared that if Meng Hao were given enough time, the sphere would continue to grow without limit. This caused many powerful experts on Planet East Victory to be filled with a sensation of vigilance. There were even streams of divine sense that converged on the Fang Clan ancestral mansion.</p>
 <p>The direct bloodline clan members in Meng Hao’s vicinity immediately began to urgently transmit messages with divine will.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao!!”</p>
 <p>“Hao’er, wake up!!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao trembled as the surrounding clan members called out. His eyes gradually began to grow clear and bright as he regained his senses. At first he looked confused, but then he raised his head up to look at the 3,000-meter sphere of light up above.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao, cease that magical technique!” barked Fang Xi’s father.</p>
 <p>A sense of crisis gradually rose up in Meng Hao from the streams of divine sense, and also from the fact that he realized that he was about to lose full control the globe of light.</p>
 <p>Eyes flickering with concentration, he let out a growl and lifted both hands up above his head. Using all the power he could muster, he exercised control of the last strand that connected him to the sphere to reverse its suction.</p>
 <p>The sphere gradually stopped absorbing light and heat, and then started to shrink. After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, the sphere began to fade away. Sweat poured down Meng Hao’s forehead.</p>
 <p>He utilized all of the energy in his body, and knew that even the slightest lapse in concentration would result in the sphere exploding.</p>
 <p>After it finally disappeared, the direct bloodline descendants approached him. Smiles could be seen on their excited faces.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked back at his 24,000-meter Dharma Idol, and sensed the Immortal meridian within him, and knew that it would be complete with only a tiny bit of effort.</p>
 <p>“Soon, the day will arrive in which my cultivation base will move into the Immortal Realm!” Meng Hao’s eyes shone with determination.</p>
 <p>“Hao’er,” said one of the direct bloodline Elders, smiling, “what magical technique was that?”</p>
 <p>“It’s a divine ability I created after being enlightened regarding the sun….” said Meng Hao, turning to clasp hands to the Elder. He had now created three divine abilities. One was A Writ of Karma, the other was the Paragon Bridge, and the third… was this sphere of light.</p>
 <p>“I’ll call it… Supernova Magic!” he said, his eyes shining brightly.</p>
 <p>“Supernova Magic…. Hao’er, this divine ability of yours… is powerful! It’s able to absorb a virtually limitless amount of heat and light and create a copy of the sun, and depending on how much it absorbed, the force of its explosion would be inestimable.” The Elder gazed deeply at Meng Hao. “However, it has a fatal flaw. It would be easy to interrupt you while you use it. Furthermore, it takes too long to prepare. It only reached 3,000 meters in the time it takes an incense stick to burn. To reach 30,000… would take several hours.</p>
 <p>“In addition, I could tell that you were not in complete control of it. If it had grown any larger, you would likely have lost control completely.</p>
 <p>“You need to analyze this magic thoroughly before you use it again.” It only took a few sentences for the old man to analyze the magic’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao nodded, then clasped hands and bowed deeply to all of the direct bloodline clan members who had stood as Dharma Protectors for him. He felt very grateful toward them, and the sensation of being their blood relative grew even stronger.</p>
 <p>Soon, the group of them turned into prismatic beams of light that shot back toward the surface of Planet East Victory. As they neared, Meng Hao saw numerous clan members flying out of the ancestral mansion, their faces filled with respect.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Prince Hao!”</p>
 <p>This term of address caused Meng Hao to stare in shock. After blinking a few times, a warm smile appeared on his face, and he offered formal greetings to all the direct bloodline clan members. Then he made to return to his Immortal’s cave.</p>
 <p>It was in that moment of departure that the Elder who had pointed out the flaws in his divine ability moments ago transmitted a message with divine will.</p>
 <p>“Be careful of Fang Xiushan!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s expression was the same as ever. He knew that Fang Xiushan was Fang Wei’s father, so he nodded in response and then left.</p>
 <p>After returning to his residence, he sat down cross-legged to meditate. After some probing, he came to the conclusion that his Immortal meridian was now more than 99% complete.</p>
 <p>“Just a bit more,” he thought. “In less than a hundred days, it will be perfectly complete, and then….” His eyes glittered with cold light. “I will become a true Immortal!”</p>
 <p>“As far as my Supernova Magic is concerned, it has some flaws. However, once my cultivation base gets high enough, I can fix them, and then I’ll have another trump card to use in battle!” He lifted his hand, and a sphere of light appeared in his palm. As it grew larger, the Fang Clan suddenly got colder. Meng Hao did nothing at first, allowing it to grow larger for a certain period of time. Then he cut off the absorbing power.</p>
 <p>“I gained a lot during this rising of the East Ascension Sun. My Dharma Idol grew to 24,000 meters, and I gained enlightenment of the sun. Plus, my fleshly body… finally had a breakthrough and reached true Immortality!</p>
 <p>“I wonder how strong I’ll be when my cultivation base has the same breakthrough!?” Meng Hao’s expression flickered with anticipation.</p>
