 <p><strong>Chapter 337: Perfect Gold Core Pill</strong></p>
 <p>When the Pill Tribulation appeared, Meng Hao sat in the Immortal’s cave, his eyes shining brightly as he stared at the pill furnace in front of him. The pill furnace was thoroughly inundated with golden light, illuminating the entire Immortal’s cave with the color of gold.</p>
 <p>As the gold light spilled out, Meng Hao could sense cracking sounds.</p>
 <p>The sounds came from within the pill furnace; Meng Hao sensed something like a liquid gold within the pill furnace, rapidly congealing, shrinking. Each time it shrank, a cracking sound could be heard, as if the liquid was being compressed.</p>
 <p>It was at this time that the Pill Tribulation appeared in the sky overhead. Such tribulation was unavoidable; Meng Hao took a deep breath and concentrated on the pill furnace.</p>
 <p>In the outside world, the Tribulation clouds spread out in all directions; lightning crackled and thunder boomed up to the Heavens. Outside of Meng Hao’s Immortal’s cave, wisps of white Qi were rising up from the short mountain. They circulated together to form into the shape of a pill furnace that seemed to wish to fly up into the sky.</p>
 <p>The sight of it caused the late Core Formation Patriarchs of the three great Sects to stare mutely. However, it didn’t take long for their expressions to fill with disbelief.</p>
 <p>“That’s… Pill Tribulation!!”</p>
 <p>“That’s definitely the legendary Pill Tribulation. I’ve read about it in the ancient records. They say that when certain medicinal pills appear, or sometimes other precious materials, the Heavens become angry and wish to exterminate the object!”</p>
 <p>“That damned Cultivator is concocting pills? Who knew he could do that?! And who would have imagined he could concoct a pill that would provoke Pill Tribulation!?”</p>
 <p>Greed appeared on the faces of the three Patriarchs.</p>
 <p>The Cultivators behind them didn’t understand what the black clouds meant, so their eyes filled with confusion. Then, the booming of thunder began to grow more intense, and their faces filled with fear.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that a huge tremor ran through the earth as what remained of the more than one hundred Cultivators powering the spell formation all coughed up blood and then passed out. As they fell, the fog dissipated.</p>
 <p>The short mountain was now visible, as were the parrot and the meat jelly, floating in mid-air. They were currently looking up into the sky, odd expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>When the fog fell, the remaining evil spirits began to scream, as if the lightning and thunder in the sky filled them with terror.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a massive, thick lightning bolt began to descend down toward the earth. As it shot down, over a thousand smaller lightning bolts merged together with it until it was nearly a meter and a half wide. It shot directly toward the short mountain.</p>
 <p>The sight of it caused the Patriarchs of the three great Sects, along with the Cultivators who surrounded them, to stare open-mouthed.</p>
 <p>However, just when everyone thought that the lightning bolt was about to smash into the mountain, it suddenly began to collapse for no apparent reason. As it did, it split into hundreds of smaller lightning bolts, which then screamed toward the trembling evil spirits.</p>
 <p>It seemed these evil spirits were also something that attracted the attention of the Heavenly Tribulation, causing it to split apart and seek to destroy them.</p>
 <p>That was the reason for the strange looks on the faces of the parrot and meat jelly. Actually, it was a lucky break that the Pill Tribulation appeared at the exact same moment that the spell formation fell apart.</p>
 <p>Explosions filled the air and the ground quaked. The hundreds of evil spirits screamed miserably as over half were instantly smashed into nothing. The other half began to slowly dissipate, intent on leaving.</p>
 <p>Not a single spark of lightning headed toward Meng Hao’s pill furnace inside the Immortal’s cave. The golden glow shone up from the pill furnace, spreading out in all directions, piercing out through the Immortal’s cave, penetrating up through the mountain and the soil.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a blinding golden light appeared outside of the short mountain. In addition, bands of golden light seeped up from within the earth.</p>
 <p>The evil spirits who had escaped the Tribulation Lightning and were dissipating, saw the golden light and then began to scream and disappear with even greater haste.</p>
 <p>A fathomless golden light!</p>
 <p>It shot out from the center of the mountain, as if a sun were buried deep within!</p>
 <p>It seemed as if this sun wished to rise up out of hell and charge into battle with the Heavens!</p>
 <p>The meat jelly and the parrot had long since flown off. However, the parrot felt bad for the Cultivators who had formed the spell formation, so before leaving, it and the meat jelly carried them off to hide some distance away.</p>
 <p>Within the blink of an eye, the mountain was no longer visible; the only thing one could see was the boundless glowing light.</p>
 <p>The light pierced up into the clouds above, causing them to churn violently. The lightning danced back and forth, and a second bolt began to form. It shot down toward the center of the golden light, the short mountain which was the nexus of it all.</p>
 <p>It moved with incredible speed, and was soon almost directly on top of the mountain.</p>
 <p>However, even as that happened….</p>
 <p>A popping sound rang out within the Immortal’s cave. The lid flew off of the pill furnace, and an unprecedentedly bright golden light emanated out, eclipsing the light from before. Something that had the appearance of a sun flew out, emanating scorchingly hot rays of golden light. Meng Hao’s Immortal’s cave seemed as if it would ignite, along with the entire mountain!</p>
 <p>What actually was… it began to melt. The stones, the restrictive spells, all the objects within, became ash in an instant. The only thing left behind was the piercing golden light which shone up into the Heavens. The light was impossible to cover up as it shot upward to slam into the lightning bolt.</p>
 <p>When the light and the lightning bolt connected, a massive boom ripped out that violently shook Heaven and Earth. The Immortal’s cave was gone; Meng Hao sat there cross-legged, bathed in goldenness. The ground beneath him was beginning to melt. The black soil was transforming into golden liquid, which spread out everywhere to form a lake!</p>
 <p>A golden lake!</p>
 <p>At the very center of the lake was Meng Hao, his hair flying about, his Violet Core spinning inside of him, the strange mark on his forehead glittering. His clothes rippled wildly, and his eyes shone with stubborness.</p>
 <p>There in his right hand… was a golden medicinal pill!</p>
 <p>It might be more correct to say that what he held was not a medicinal pill, but a blazing golden sun!</p>
 <p>This golden pill was the Perfect Gold Core Pill!</p>
 <p>The Patriarchs from the three great Sects, along with the hundreds of other Cultivators, stood there with hearts pounding. The instant they saw the medicinal pill, the Dao Pillars of the Foundation Establishment Cultivators began to tremble, as if they were aware that the results of consuming this pill would be different from that of any other.</p>
 <p>As for the Core Formation Cultivators, especially the three Patriarchs, their bodies trembled violently. They could sense intense hope emanating out from the Cores within their bodies. It seemed as if their Cores wanted to merge with this golden medicinal pill. It only took a moment for the three Cultivators to suddenly understand; were they able to consume this pill, then… they would be able to tread an unprecedented path of cultivation!</p>
 <p>Only the three Patriarchs could control themselves; the remaining hundreds of Cultivators instantly went crazy and shot directly toward Meng Hao, intent on stealing the Perfect Gold Core Pill.</p>
 <p>However, even as they approached, the sound of thunder filled the air as three lightning bolts congealed. Meng Hao’s hair whipped in the air as he used all the power he possessed to place the pill in his mouth and consume it!</p>
 <p>Here begins the great Dao of the Gold Core!</p>
