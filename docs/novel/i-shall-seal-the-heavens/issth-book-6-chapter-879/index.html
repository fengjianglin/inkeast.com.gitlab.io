 <p><strong>Chapter 879: Peak Battle!</strong></p>
 <p>Zhao Yifan suddenly looked up at Meng Hao, and his eyes overflowed with the desire to fight. Before his trip to Planet South Heaven, there had only been two people of his same generation who filled him with such a desire to fight.</p>
 <p>After Planet South Heaven, there was another, Meng Hao. And now… yet another, Fang Mu.</p>
 <p>Monstrous fighting desire raged inside of him. Behind him, his 3,000-meter Dharma Idol held the Cloud Sealing Sword, and was radiating shocking sword qi. As Zhao Yifan raised his head, he also lifted up his hand. Simultaneously, his Dharma Idol raised the Cloud Sealing Sword.</p>
 <p>“First Sword, Felling the Mortal!” cried Zhao Yifan, and the sword descended!</p>
 <p>The sword did not transform into an Azure Dragon, but rather, a green beam of light that instantly caused the entire golden arena to quake. A huge rift was ripped open in the air, and a massive rumbling sound echoed out. Wild colors flashed, and the heavenly bodies shook. Radiating a monstrous will, it shot toward Meng Hao, seemingly incapable of being blocked.</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as the first sword descended, Zhao Yifan’s energy surged upward, and in the midst of the already intense power, more explosive power appeared. Zhao Yifan swept forward like a whirlwind, and then gave a piercing shout.</p>
 <p>“Second Sword, Shocking the Spirit!”</p>
 <p>After that, a third sword appeared.</p>
 <p>“Third Sword, Severing the Immortal!”</p>
 <p>This sword caused rumbling to fill the air as it followed the first two swords, splitting Heaven and Earth, surging forward invincibly!</p>
 <p>After that, a fourth sword appeared.</p>
 <p>“Fourth Sword, Shattering the Ancient!”</p>
 <p>Each sword was faster than the previous sword, and more powerful. The four swords caused colors to flash, and the air to vibrate. Everything began to shake, and all the other cultivators on the Dao Tree looked on in astonishment.</p>
 <p>The heavenly bodies seemed to grow dark, as if all the splendor of the world was being replaced by these swords.</p>
 <p>However… Zhao Yifan wasn’t finished.</p>
 <p>“Fifth Sword, Trampling the Heavens!”</p>
 <p>Shockingly, a fifth sword appeared. This fifth sword was far more incisive than all the previous four swords. Everyone who could see it with their own eyes felt as if they were being suffocated. The spectators out in the Ninth Mountain and Sea made a collective gasp, and the Patriarchs in the starry sky palace looked on with shining eyes.</p>
 <p>Five swords, shocking to the extreme!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao remained standing in his original position. Although his expression was calm, a nearly undetectable desire to fight flickered in his eyes. As the five swords descended toward him, the black sealing marks all over his body began to move, swirling across his skin. His Devilish will exploded out, distorting the air and even affecting time. To him, it seemed as if everything he was seeing was now moving in slow motion.</p>
 <p>He didn’t move, but instead lifted his hand, performed an incantation gesture, and then tapped the first sword.</p>
 <p>A boom could be heard as black light spread out from Meng Hao’s finger. The first sword, with its astonishing energy, came to a stop in front of the fingertip. A howl of rage could be heard echoing out from the sword as it suddenly transformed into millions upon millions of swords. Just when they were about to try to sidestep the power of Meng Hao’s finger attack, they began to tremble, and then simply exploded. Sword qi spread out in all directions, causing the golden arena to shake violently, seemingly on the verge of collapse. Meng Hao took a step forward, then pointed out a second time with his index finger to tap the second beam of sword qi.</p>
 <p>A massive boom rattled out in all directions. Everything shook as the second sword collapsed in response to Meng Hao’s finger attack, transforming into even more swords than had appeared just moments before, all of which then exploded.</p>
 <p>When the spectators on the outside saw this, they were astonished. Everything was happening too quickly, giving them virtually no time to react. Meng Hao took a third step forward, right into the middle of endless sword shadows. Boundless sword qi swirled around him, and the number of swords was innumerable. It was almost as if he had entered a world of swords.</p>
 <p>The third sword attack formed a globe of swords that began to shrink down as soon as Meng Hao stepped into it, transforming into one sword that slashed down toward him. Meng Hao’s right hand lifted up, and a third finger attack was unleashed.</p>
 <p>When it touched the third sword, a boom rattled out that shook the whole Dao Tree. A massive wind kicked up, and everything went dark for a moment. Even the mists outside of the Dao Tree began to churn.</p>
 <p>In the midst of all the noise, the third sword attack… shattered into pieces. Everyone in the outside world watched as the sword world collapsed, and Meng Hao stepped out, his fourth step.</p>
 <p>All of this takes some time to describe, but actually, Meng Hao’s four steps took place in the space of only a few breaths. By this time, the fourth and fifth sword attacks were bearing down on him simultaneously. They were like two lightning bolts that slashed through the air, bearing monstrous sword will.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered as he raised his right hand. He waved his finger two times, once for each of the two beams of sword qi. Shocking rumbling could be heard, booms that caused everything to quake. The air surrounding the arena twisted and distorted, and even the barrier separating the Dao Tree from the outside world seemed to be affected.</p>
 <p>The sword qi collapsed, dispersing as Meng Hao took his fifth step. By that time, he was directly in front of Zhao Yifan, whereupon his right hand stretched out in a claw.</p>
 <p>Zhao Yifan immediately fell back, waving his arm and causing a sixth sword to appear. After that came a seventh sword, which descended toward Meng Hao amidst massive rumbling. Two beams of sword qi swept toward him, although they did nothing to prevent him from advancing.</p>
 <p>“Seven Swords Slaughter Mount Heaven!” roared Zhao Yifan in an earth shattering voice. His Dharma Idol took a step forward, raising its right hand to lift the 300-meter Cloud Sealing Sword. In this moment, it looked incredibly realistic, as if it truly existed.</p>
 <p>Colors flashed, and a will of invincibility exploded out as the sword descended toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao stopped in place and looked up. A vicious smile then appeared on his face, and he stamped his foot down onto the surface of the arena. Rumbling could be heard as… his own enormous Dharma Idol materialized!</p>
 <p>When the Dharma Idol appeared, it was 3,000 meters tall, filled with shocking energy. It stepped forward and performed a double-handed incantation, then punched toward the huge sword descending from above.</p>
 <p>From a distance, it was possible to see the two enormous Dharma Idols engaged in fierce fighting. Down on the surface of the arena, Meng Hao’s body was wreathed in black flames, making him look like some sort of terrifying Devil. He advanced toward Zhao Yifan, waving his hand to cause millions of streams to appear, which then transformed into an enormous river.</p>
 <p>Zhao Yifan’s face flickered; he bit his tongue and then spit out some blood, each droplet of which transformed into an enormous sea, all of which then formed together into an even larger shocking composite sea. This was a sea that was not composed of water, but countless swords!</p>
 <p>It was… a sea of swords!</p>
 <p>The sea of swords immediately slammed into the massive river that was Meng Hao’s Mountain Consuming Incantation. A shockwave spread out in all directions, causing everything to tremble. The dazzling light of magical techniques and divine abilities radiated out in all directions.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao didn’t stop for a moment. His body flickered as he transformed into an enormous black, flaming vulture. He whistled through the air, piercing the sea of swords to appear in front of Zhao Yifan and viciously slash razor-sharp claws at him. Zhao Yifan’s face darkened as he fell back in shock. At this moment, he finally understood why all of Meng Hao’s previous opponents had suffered setback after setback in combat. Now that he was experiencing the same thing himself, he truly felt terror of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao had an aura of invincibility, and he only attacked, sparing nothing for defense.</p>
 <p>Facing this energy, one had no choice but to retreat, and by doing so, involuntarily fall into Meng Hao’s rhythm of battle. Eventually, the continuous retreat would lead to one end… defeat.</p>
 <p>Booms echoed out as over a hundred exchanges occurred between Zhao Yifan and Meng Hao. The golden arena was wracked with massive booms. As for the crowds outside in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, they watched the scene unfold with pounding hearts. The only thing they were paying attention to was the groundbreaking championship battle between Meng Hao and Zhao Yifan.</p>
 <p>“I can’t keep retreating!” thought Zhao Yifan, blood oozing out of his mouth. Suddenly, a fierce gleam appeared in his eyes as his Dharma Idol, which was currently locked in combat with Meng Hao’s Dharma Idol, grew to a height of 6,000 meters, causing something like a violent windstorm to spread out across the arena.</p>
 <p>Taking advantage of that blast of power, Zhao Yifan took a deep breath, and looked at Meng Hao with an unprecedented look of solemnity.</p>
 <p>“Five Cleaving Swords, First Cleaving… Rising Sword Form!” As he spoke, he lifted his right hand. Sword qi began to swirl around each of his five fingers, and his speed suddenly increased to shocking effect. He waved his hand, causing numerous beams of sword qi to shoot out.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, 100 swords appeared in the form of sword qi. Shockingly, they flew up into the air, then spun and began to fall down toward Meng Hao like a rain of swords. Meng Hao’s eyes glittered as he stretched out his right hand and made a grasping motion, which caused the long spear with the World Tree shaft and the bone spearhead to appear. He immediately swept it out in front of him, causing rumbling sounds to be heard as the 100 swords were deflected and sent stabbing into the surface of the arena.</p>
 <p>However, Zhao Yifan’s divine ability was still unfolding. 1,000 swords appeared up above, which then whistled down toward Meng Hao. The long spear danced, and more booms could be heard as the thousand swords were scattered and sent plunging into the ground. However, it was at this point that 10,000 swords appeared up above.</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the air as they began to fall. The arena had now become a world of swords. Meng Hao was surrounded by a whirlwind, which was the long spear. Banging sounds could be heard as the 10,000 swords were vanquished and sent stabbing into the ground.</p>
 <p>However, it was at this point that Zhao Yifan spoke again.</p>
 <p>“First Cleaving, Swords Cleave the Heavens!” Instantly, the 11,100 swords that had been stabbed into the ground rose up into the sky, where they merged together to form one huge sword.</p>
 <p>One shocking sword appeared, a sword that caused the entire world to go still. For the first time, Meng Hao’s facial expression changed as he looked up to stare at the huge weapon. He took a deep breath, raised his right foot up, and then stamped it down hard.</p>
 <p>A boom echoed out, and his Dharma Idol suddenly began to expand until it too was 6,000 meters tall. It took a step forward and then punched out toward the huge sword.</p>
 <p>The resulting boom was deafening, and the entire world trembled. The sword slashed through the fist of Meng Hao’s Dharma Idol, then continued to cut down until it was only seven inches away from the top of Meng Hao’s head, where it came to a stop. A defiant droning sound could be heard from the sword, and then it collapsed.</p>
 <p>When the sword fell to pieces, Zhao Yifan coughed up blood and staggered backward.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked up at the collapsing sword, and then turned to look at Zhao Yifan.</p>
 <p>“You’re pretty strong….” he said. “But now, it’s my turn.” With that, he vanished. When he reappeared, he was directly in front of Zhao Yifan, whereupon he clenched his hand into a fist and punched.</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Meng Hao punched nine times; this was none other than the Nine Heavens Destruction.</p>
 <p>The final blow unleashed violent upheavals. Zhao Yifan was sent tumbling backward, blood spraying from his mouth. He toppled head over heels along the ground, but before he could get very far, Meng Hao transformed into the vulture and swooped down toward him.</p>
