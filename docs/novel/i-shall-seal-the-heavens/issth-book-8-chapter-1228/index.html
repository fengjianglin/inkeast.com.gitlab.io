 <p><strong>Chapter 1228: Supreme Power!</strong></p>
 <p>It was like a frightening laughter that, if you listened to it long enough, sounded like weeping laced with indescribable sorrow.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao stared silently at the Daoist priest sitting there on the statue, then closed his eyes. It was not a moment to disturb the man. He knew that the Daoist priest was now in his own world.</p>
 <p>At dawn, the Daoist priest vanished, and then reappeared in front of Meng Hao, as muddle-headed and unreliable as ever.</p>
 <p>When Meng Hao opened his eyes, he saw a lively and energetic Daoist priest standing there who didn’t seem to have a care in the world. “Come, come, my little disciple, shout loudly with your Master. The Dao is in My Heart The Will is in My Eyes I Shall Possess the Mountains and Seas Seal the Heavens Incantation!”</p>
 <p>Time passed. More and more cultivators were gathering outside of the Righteous Noble Sect. They crowded the lands and filled the sky; more than 1,000,000 cultivators had been attracted to the area because of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The Righteous Noble Sect felt a lot of pressure, and the sect’s protective spell formation was active day and night. No one dared to relax for a moment, and the disciples were constantly on guard.</p>
 <p>One by one, more Dao Realm experts arrived. Eventually there were almost twenty, causing a terrifying pressure to weigh down on the entire area.</p>
 <p>Occasionally the mass of cultivators would cause ripples to spread out across the land, and the sky would distort under their auras. The pressure was so strong that it seemed like the Heavens themselves were bearing down. No smiles could be seen on the faces of the disciples of the Righteous Noble Sect, and on more than one occasion, Meng Hao could see hateful glances cast in his direction.</p>
 <p>Although this was the Righteous Noble Sect, where they cultivated a righteous, noble aura, the pressure from the outside and the danger the sect was now in made it unavoidable that they feel rancor toward the person who had brought this down upon them.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao rarely went down off the mountain anymore. He simply sat there quietly, watching the teleportation portal being activated ten times, sometimes even dozens of times, each day. It was happening with such frequency that it became mundane, and every time it activated, human-looking figures would be among the things that were teleported.</p>
 <p>Occasionally, the teleportation portal would be used several dozen times in a row. This ensured that there was no pattern to how it was being used, and also caused the cultivators of the Heavengod Alliance on the outside who wanted to try to break the teleportation process to slowly grow completely exhausted.</p>
 <p>Soon, there were only twenty days left of the two month period. On one particular afternoon, the Daoist priest found Meng Hao to practice the Seal the Heavens Incantation, after which he suddenly said, “Alright, enough time has passed. We don’t want anyone to be able to calculate the time exactly, so therefore, you’re leaving right now!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with a serious look as he slowly rose to his feet. He clasped hands and bowed deeply, then the two of them sped over to the location of the teleportation portal. This was not their first trip there together, they had actually been on numerous occasions. Not only would it make it difficult for anyone on the outside to detect what was going on, it would also confuse anyone within the sect who was paying attention and passing information to the outside.</p>
 <p>When they got to the teleportation portal, it had already been activated, and someone was inside, waiting to be teleported away. The surrounding disciples in charge of the portal didn’t pay much attention at all to the Daoist priest and Meng Hao, who they were used to seeing here.</p>
 <p>The Daoist priest looked at Meng Hao and began to speak in a hoarse voice: “If the teleportation goes successfully, you’ll emerge near the border of the Heavengod Alliance. The border region is too vast and can’t be sealed completely, so that will be your opportunity. You’ll need to employ as much speed as you can manage to cross the border and leave the Heavengod Alliance. Then... you’ll be safe.</p>
 <p>“If anyone blocks your path, or destroys the teleportation path, then remember to keep heading in the same direction that the path was taking you!</p>
 <p>“Once you step onto the teleportation portal, everything will be up to you....”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he flicked his sleeve, causing the teleportation portal to perform several teleportations in a row. Rumbling filled the air, and bright light rose up. But then, it suddenly stopped. After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, the Daoist priest suddenly barked, “Now!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao's eyes flickered. He stepped into the teleportation portal without the slightest hesitation. Almost immediately, he saw that outside of the Righteous Noble Sect were countless other teleportation portals being activated at the same time, as the cultivators there tried to match their frequencies to the teleportation portal inside the sect.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s face flickered, but it was at this point that the Daoist priest suddenly stepped into the teleportation portal and grabbed Meng Hao by the arm.</p>
 <p>In the instant that the teleportation portal was activated, the Daoist priest leapt off of the portal, dragging Meng Hao with him as he then flickered and shot up into the sky at high speed.</p>
 <p>Immediately, numerous angered cries could be heard from outside the Righteous Noble Sect.</p>
 <p>“Shameless!”</p>
 <p>“Noble Ran, don’t tell me you’re rebelling against the Heavengod Alliance!?!?”</p>
 <p>“Dammit!!”</p>
 <p>More than half of the Dao Realm experts on the outside were already bathed in the light of teleportation. The Daoist priest had timed his move very craftily. Once the portals were activated, there was no way for the people inside them to leave, and they had to go along with the teleportation.</p>
 <p>The remaining Dao Realm experts who had not entered teleportation portals bellowed in rage and shot into the air toward the Daoist priest.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes glittered. The Daoist priest hadn’t mentioned anything at all about this before. Obviously, everything he had been doing with the teleportation portals in the past several weeks, including the feint just now, had been a trap. It was all bait to lure the experts of the Heavengod Alliance away.</p>
 <p>The Daoist priest never had any intention of having Meng Hao use the Righteous Noble Sect’s teleportation portal to escape. Doing that... was far too unsafe and had too many weak points.</p>
 <p>However, his performance had been so realistic that many people were fooled and, no matter whether they were willing or not, got stuck in the teleportation portals and then vanished. In fact, there was an even deeper layer to this plan; because of all the activity with the teleportation portals, the cultivators of the Heavengod Alliance had long since concentrated all of their attention on the portal. In order to intercept him, massive numbers of cultivators had even been arranged to surround every teleportation node within the entire Alliance. Furthermore, they engaged the help of almighty experts whose task was expressly to cover Planet Luo River with their divine sense, laying in wait to sever any teleportation beams leaving the planet.</p>
 <p>If Meng Hao really had tried to get away via teleportation, it would have been impossible for him to reach his destination. He would have been attacked and forcibly ejected from the teleportation beam.</p>
 <p>Rumbling echoed out as the Daoist priest shot up into the sky with Meng Hao, moving at incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, they were outside of Planet Luo River. Meng Hao looked over at the Daoist priest, and was once again deeply moved. Behind them, angered roars could be heard as six beams of light closed in, six almighty Dao Realm cultivators.</p>
 <p>Behind them were countless more cultivators, all of them racing to catch up with the Daoist priest and Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>It only took a moment for the other cultivators throughout the Heavengod Alliance, the ones sent to lock down the teleportation portals or ambush Meng Hao’s teleportation beam, to be notified of what had happened. They immediately abandoned their positions and raced toward Planet Luo River at top speed.</p>
 <p>One slight change can sometimes have a huge effect on the overall situation. The Daoist priest’s sudden action caused the entire setup put in place by the Heavengod Alliance to be ruined. Rumbling echoed out in all directions as the Daoist priest and Meng Hao entered the starry sky.</p>
 <p>“Come with me,” the Daoist priest said, eyes glittering. He waved his hand, causing a flying shuttle to appear, upon which he and Meng Hao alighted. Then, rumbling could be heard as the flying shuttle shot out into the starry sky at incredible speed.</p>
 <p>As soon as he landed on the flying shuttle, Meng Hao shivered and looked down at it.</p>
 <p>“This is....”</p>
 <p>“How could Master allow anyone to harm you, my little disciple? The Righteous Noble Sect’s teleportation portals were all being watched. Even if they hadn’t been, I would never have felt at ease letting you use them.</p>
 <p>“The only type of teleportation portal I can trust would be one created by myself!</p>
 <p>“This flying shuttle is actually a teleportation portal. Sit down cross-legged, and merge your mind into the shuttle. Go, quickly! The faster the shuttle goes, the more powerful the teleportation will be. I refuse to believe that these people could have predicted that I would have a flying shuttle teleportation portal!” With that, the Daoist priest waved his hand behind him. Rumbling echoed out as the six pursuing Dao Realm experts launched attacks.</p>
 <p>The Daoist priest trembled, and blood oozed out of his mouth. He might be strong, but he was not strong enough to handle six Dao Realm cultivators simultaneously.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that two streams of divine sense suddenly shot through the air toward them all. Shockingly, these were also Dao Realm experts. Now there were eight of them, three of which were Dao Lords. All of these people were on the level of Patriarchs in the various sects of the Heavengod Alliance, and when they combined forces, their Essence power caused the shuttle to tremble on the verge of collapse.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s face flickered, and the Daoist priest suddenly threw his head back and laughed. Then, he reached down and slapped his left hand onto the surface of the flying shuttle, giving it more power. It suddenly shot forward at ten times its original speed. It was moving so fast that it seemed to be engulfed with flames; simultaneously, the teleportation portal inside began to activate. A shapeless rift opened up in front of the shuttle, and it looked as if the shuttle were about to be swallowed up by a huge mouth.</p>
 <p>This caused the faces of all the observers to fill with shock. The Dao Realm Patriarchs howled in rage.</p>
 <p>“You can’t get away!” one of them roared. As soon as the words rang out, it seemed like the rules of nature changed to follow suit. Essence transformed into natural law, wrapping around Meng Hao. However, it was at this moment that the Daoist priest began to laugh loudly. Eyes shining, he shouted,</p>
 <p>“Watch closely, my apprentice. Before you leave, your Master will demonstrate... the Seal the Heavens Incantation!” With that, he bent his legs into a circle and then pointed his right index finger up into the starry sky.</p>
 <p>“The Dao is in My Heart!” As soon as the words left his mouth, time seemed to slow to a halt, and everything stopped moving. A righteous, noble aura filled the area, and the Eighth Mountain and Sea began to tremble.</p>
 <p>More shocking of all was that the Daoist priest’s bent legs all of a sudden looked like a tilted mountain peak!</p>
 <p>“The Will is in My Eyes!” He moved his left hand to intersect with his right hand. His hair whipped about wildly, and a strange gleam shone from his eyes. At the same time, an indescribable aura suddenly began to radiate out from him.</p>
 <p>“I Shall Possess the Mountains and Seas! Seal... the Heavens... Incantation!!” With that, his legs straightened as he leaped up and stretched his arms out wide!!</p>
 <p>The Eighth Mountain was shaking so violently it seemed as if it would crumble. The Eighth Sea howled, and the starry sky distorted. Everything was in chaos. As for Meng Hao, he could see the qi flow of the Mountain and Sea Realm converging on the Daoist priest. Massive power built up in his outstretched arms and then shot out into the starry sky.</p>
 <p>Faintly, an image of the Nine Mountains and Nine Seas of the Mountain and Sea Realm appeared, filled with supreme power!!</p>
 <p>Everyone present was completely shocked!</p>
