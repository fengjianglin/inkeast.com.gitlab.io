 <p><strong>Chapter 584: Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao</strong></p>
 <p>As the familiar voice echoed in Meng Hao’s ears, he felt as if a gentle wind were blowing him back to those wonderful days in the vicious Reliance Sect.</p>
 <p>Within that Sect was a wicked, wretched, duplicitous, unreliable old turtle….</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes widened as he saw a dark shadow appear up ahead. At the same time, the sky darkened, and snapping sounds could be heard.</p>
 <p>The shield surrounding Meng Hao began to collapse, and nearly exploded. Then, a screech of pain could be heard, and the area up ahead of Meng Hao became light once again, revealing… a huge, fierce turtle, retreating at top speed.</p>
 <p>The turtle was fully several thousand meters wide, with an anxious expression on its huge face. It then glared fiercely at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Shocked, Meng Hao fell back a few paces as his cracked shield quickly repaired itself. As of this moment, he realized that without the shield, he would currently be crushed inside of that damnable Patriarch Reliance’s mouth.</p>
 <p>The Patriarch Reliance in his memory was far larger than this turtle in front of him. However, the unreliable appearance, his sneak attack method, and his tone of voice were all exactly the same as the Patriarch Reliance that Meng Hao knew.</p>
 <p>A strange expression appeared on Meng Hao’s face as he looked at this Patriarch Reliance. New hatred piled up in his heart. He thought back to the untold trials and tribulations he had gone through to help Patriarch Reliance, only to be ripped off in the end by the stingy old turtle.</p>
 <p>In the end, Patriarch Reliance even tried to eat him! It was only because of the reminder from Guyiding Tri-Rain, and his recitation of the Demon Sealing Scripture, that unreliable Patriarch Reliance was sent running.</p>
 <p>“How strange,” said Patriarch Reliance, glaring at him. “Something about your expression seems a bit off. Don’t tell me you recognize this old Patriarch?” His expression was strange as he looked at Meng Hao and the shield surrounding him. He gritted his jaw, looking inexplicably hateful.</p>
 <p>“The Patriarch hates cheating children more than anything else, and you’re obviously a cheater! You, you, you… you dare to try to pass through here with a shield! Bamboozler!!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao backed up a few steps. Looking Patriarch Reliance over carefully, he suddenly said, “Ancient Dao; tenacious desire to seal the heavens….”</p>
 <p>After speaking a few words, there was no reaction whatsoever from Patriarch Reliance. In fact, he seemed even more astonished, confused, and curious.</p>
 <p>“What the fudge! What are you doing, cursing me?”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao backed up a few more steps, abandoning the Demon Sealing Scripture. After another look at Patriarch Reliance, he suddenly laughed.</p>
 <p>The laugh contained a bit of bashfulness; at the same time, a strange light could be seen shining in his eyes. The entire expression caused Patriarch Reliance to tremble with astonishment.</p>
 <p>“What the fudge! What gives? What the hell! What kind of fishy thing is going here? Kid, there’s something wrong with your expression….”</p>
 <p>“Listen, bitch!” cried Meng Hao, “I’m not just gonna curse you, I’m gonna beat the crap out of you!” Roaring, he leaped up into the air and slapped his bag of holding, causing a vast quantity of talismans to appear.</p>
 <p>Every single talisman emanated shocking power, blinding light, and incredible pressure. Patriarch Reliance’s eyes went wide.</p>
 <p>“Too vicious!!!” cried Patriarch Reliance, retreating backward at top speed. The feeling he got from the talismans caused his heart to race with fear. Before he could retreat too far, Meng Hao waved his hand, causing the talismans to ignite. An immense, red glow could be seen, from within which exploded countless Thunder Dragons. Their roars filled the air as they shot toward Patriarch Reliance.</p>
 <p>Amidst the echoing booms, Patriarch Reliance shrieked and hollered, dodging back and forth. His rage billowed up, and he was about to say something when Meng Hao waved his hand again, causing seventy or eighty more talismans to fly out. As they exploded chaotically, the air shook and the ground was torn to pieces. Patriarch Reliance howled and charged toward Meng Hao’s shield.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao clearly had no intention of evading or dodging. He allowed the old turtle to slam into his shield, after which a huge explosion could be heard along with a miserable shriek. Patriarch Reliance immediately tumbled backward, during which time Meng Hao waved his arm, causing more than a thousand talismans to be hurled out.</p>
 <p>These were all talismans personally created by Ke Yunhai. They needed no direction from Meng Hao. All he had to do was throw them out, and they would voluntarily transform into divine abilities and Daoist magic. Up above in the air, more than a thousand statues suddenly appeared, all of which instantly dove down toward Patriarch Reliance.</p>
 <p>This barrage of attacks had Patriarch Reliance knocked into a daze. He shot backward relentlessly, his shell on the verge of being shattered, his heart filled with astonishment, as howls of rage emitted from his mouth.</p>
 <p>“I surrender! The Patriarch surrenders! … Fudge, you’re such a cheat! I never cheat like this!!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t accept surrender!” growled Meng Hao. No matter what was said, he would have his revenge. He waved his hand again, causing another thousand talismans to appear. Bloodcurdling shrieks continued to echo out. Patriarch Reliance trembled as he attempted to flee this way and that. The feeling of frustration in his heart had reached a pinnacle.</p>
 <p>“Dammit, DAMMIT!” howled Patriarch Reliance, “Is there a grudge between us?!”</p>
 <p>BAM!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao produced several hundred more talismans.</p>
 <p>“What did I do to piss you off? Huh? Come on, tell me!!” Patriarch Reliance was on the verge of tears. He was incapable of evasion, and could do nothing more than retract his trembling limbs and head into his shell. “I was just born recently, I haven’t even grown up yet. How could I have pissed you off?!?!”</p>
 <p>“You haven’t pissed me off,” said Meng Hao. “But that doesn’t mean you won’t piss me off in the future!” He waved his hand again, causing more miserable shrieks to come from Patriarch Reliance.</p>
 <p>“Stick your head out of your shell,” commanded Meng Hao, producing another large amassment of talismans and staring at Patriarch Reliance.</p>
 <p>“I won’t stick my head out even if you beat me to death! You’re just a big bully! You’re incomparable! You… you’re impossible!!”</p>
 <p>“If I don’t bully you now, then you’ll bully me in the future!” said Meng Hao coldly. He produced even more talismans, which he continuously tossed out. Booming filled the air, along with Patriarch Reliance’s miserable shrieks. He retreated more, weeping.</p>
 <p>His shell was now almost half destroyed, and his body quivered as if from coldness. His head was pulled back tight inside, as if he really refused to stick it out even if he died.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked at him, then leaped up onto his shell. He slapped his bag of holding to produce another magical item that Ke Yunhai had made for him. It was a small blade, seemingly dull, but in fact equipped with a fiercely sharp coldness. Meng Hao hefted the blade then squatted down and began to carve some words into Patriarch Reliance’s shell.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao’s turtle!”</p>
 <p>After carving the three words, Meng Hao patted the turtle shell, then smiled complacently.</p>
 <p>“We’ll call it quits today. It might be difficult for you, but I hope that in the future you'll remember that you’re MY turtle!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Reliance glared at him, clenching his jaw. He knew that Meng Hao had carved something onto his back, and had long since made an inward determination to pay back this insult.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao stamped his foot and flew up into the air, preparing to move on to the 71st level. However, as soon as he flew into the air, he suddenly seemed to think of something. He looked down just in the moment in which Patriarch Reliance stuck his head out of his shell.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao suddenly smiled, then subconsciously pulled out a talisman. Frightened, Patriarch Reliance retracted his head as fast as lightning, then howled, “Didn’t you say that we would call it quits today?! You, you, you… you tricked me!!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s body flashed and he suddenly appeared directly in front of Patriarch Reliance, who was retracted in his shell. His powerful shield made it so that he wasn’t afraid at all of any sort of sneak attack by the turtle.</p>
 <p>“I’ll let you off this time,” said Meng Hao earnestly, “but I’m still trying to decide whether or not to destroy you to get the reward for this level.”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Reliance trembled within his turtle shell. He then opened his mouth to spit out golden beam of light that shot toward Meng Hao. It pierced through the shield, transforming into a magical symbol.</p>
 <p>The magical symbol was something that looked like a seed, which emanated colorful light as well as an indescribable pressure. It gave off a feeling of splendor, which instantly caused the rest of the world to grow dark, as if the sky itself had dimmed.</p>
 <p>Because it contained a Dao of Heaven and Earth, existing in a place above the natural laws of the world, anyone who cultivated it would have a great Dao!</p>
 <p>This was one of the top 10 Daoist magics of the 3,000!</p>
 <p>Even in the Demon Immortal Sect, this was truly an incredible and shocking magical technique. Its origin was unclear, and even in ancient times few people understood it clearly.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao took a deep breath as he examined the magic. His heart began to beat out of control. Other than the Soul Divergence Incantation, this was the most powerful Daoist Magic that he had seen in the entire time he had been in this ancient world of the Demon Immortal Sect.</p>
 <p>“I wonder what Daoist magic this is?!” he thought.</p>
 <p>He took a deep breath and raised his hand to push his finger down into the magical symbol. Instantly, his brain filled with a roaring sound.</p>
 <p>The mark required no enlightenment. As soon as his finger touched it, it rushed into his body to his heart, where it transformed into a seed.</p>
 <p>This… was the seed of a great Dao, one of the top 10 Daoist magics. It required no enlightenment. In fact, enlightenment was useless. This seed would only sprout in the mind of someone destined to receive it!</p>
 <p>If destiny existed between him and this seed, it would always be there. Were there no destiny, then forcing it would be useless!</p>
 <p>The illusory seed rapidly transformed into nine parts, seven of which rushed toward his seven nascent souls.</p>
 <p>The other two remained in his heart.</p>
 <p>The instant the seven seeds made contact with his Nascent Souls, they began to tremble. Shockingly, they rapidly began to solidify from something illusory into something real. It seemed… that Meng Hao had acquired their approval, and that they had chosen to sprout within him!</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, in the outside world, the eyes of all the Demon Immortal Sect disciples were fixed on the glow of magical light on the 70th level of the pagoda. This was especially true of the Cultivators from South Heaven.</p>
 <p>Even Ke Yunhai’s expression was one of increased anticipation. As for the other Paragons, they were watching closely as well. All of them knew that this was a chance to get one of the top 10 Daoist magics.</p>
 <p>In this moment, the sky above the Demon Immortal Sect suddenly filled with roiling clouds. A red glow filled the lands, and a beam of bright light shot down. As soon as the beam of light appeared, the Seventh Peak Paragon suddenly opened his eyes, which glowed brightly.</p>
 <p>“This is….”</p>
 <p>The light fell, turning blurry, and then splitting into three parts.</p>
 <p>The meaning of such a sign was something that most people wouldn’t understand. However, the Paragons present all watched on with serious looks.</p>
 <p>Ke Yunhai began to pant slightly. Any other matter that occurred would not have left him so visibly shaken. However, since it affected Ke Jiusi, he couldn’t help but be moved. His eyes shone with a strange light, and he almost couldn’t bring himself to believe that what was happening was true.</p>
 <p>The three beams of light split again, turning into nine beams of light. In the blink of an eye, those nine beams of light… shockingly merged together into the form of an enormous figure.</p>
 <p>It was a somewhat indistinct figure, but it was still possible to see that it was Meng Hao’s face!</p>
 <p>It was like a gigantic, magical image, shocking enough to cause Heaven and Earth to tremble.</p>
 <p>Next, the magical image opened its mouth and began to speak with an archaic voice that filled the entire Demon Immortal Sect.</p>
 <p>“One bloodline, transformed into three souls. Three souls tempered into nine divinities. Nine divinities refined into my true self. I am… Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao!”</p>
 <p>In this same instant, for some apparently unfathomable reason, one of the three inverted Demon Mountains hanging up above the Demon Immortal Sect, the mountain which seemed to formed of molten stone… suddenly trembled!</p>
 <p>Everyone, including the Seven Paragons and all the disciples, were completely shaken.</p>
