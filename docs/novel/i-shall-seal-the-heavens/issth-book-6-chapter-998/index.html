 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>A brutal attack!</p>
 <p>“Xiushan!!” When Fang Heshan saw what happened, his face filled with grief. He threw his head back and howled. Were it not for the Grand Elder going all out to block his way, he would have instantly charged towards Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, all of the cultivators of the various sects and clans of the Ninth Mountain and Sea were staring in complete shock at what was happening. They already knew that Meng Hao was incredibly powerful, but when they saw him kill Fang Xiushan, they were completely shaken on a deep and profound level.</p>
 <p>They looked at Meng Hao, eyes wide with jealousy.</p>
 <p>“He’s a powerful expert who has surpassed everyone in his generation, and can even fight with people in the Ancient Realm!”</p>
 <p>“It’s too bad that he’s going to perish because of the upheaval in the Fang Clan....”</p>
 <p>“If he doesn’t die in this battle, then his future... will be unimaginable!” Gasps could be heard throughout the Ninth Mountain and Sea as Fang Xiushan died.</p>
 <p>The disbelief on his face in the moments before death was clear. He was in the Ancient Realm, with two extinguished Soul Lamps. And yet, he died at the hands of an Immortal Realm cultivator. He had come to exact vengeance for his Wei’er, and in the end... had himself been annihilated.</p>
 <p>From the moment he had learned that Meng Hao was returning to the clan, he had wanted to kill him. From the ambush out in the starry sky, to the way he had targeted Meng Hao in the clan, to the attempt on his life in the Ancestral Land, all of that proved that he and Meng Hao were as incompatible as fire and water.</p>
 <p>Even more lamentable was that it wasn’t until the moment he died that he realized who his true enemy was. It wasn’t Meng Hao. It was the Sixth Patriarch.</p>
 <p>Perhaps Fang Xiushan did know. Perhaps he had known all along what would happen. And yet, in his mind, perhaps... he truly felt that allowing the Sixth Patriarch to possess his son would be an honor for Fang Wei.</p>
 <p>Perhaps his way of thinking was madness, or perhaps not. In any case, it was no longer important.</p>
 <p>Everything was settled by Meng Hao in his current state. The wave of a hand, the unleashing of a divine ability!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao suddenly reached a certain enlightenment.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps… all machinations and plots can be foiled with the wave of a hand by a powerful expert? Perhaps everything can even be reversed? If so, then will all of the upheaval in the Fang Clan... be changed by the wave of some powerful expert’s hand?” Meng Hao looked around at the Fang Clan and the unceasing slaughter that was being carried out. None of the recent turns of events did anything to stop the carnage. Blood flowed everywhere, and screams of terror and rage floated about constantly. It was impossible to tell who was winning or losing, but it was clear... what would happen in the end.</p>
 <p>The Fang Clan would be thoroughly destroyed.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao couldn't shake the feeling that the upheavals in the Fang Clan were simply too strange. In fact, he still wasn’t ready to completely accept everything that was happening.</p>
 <p>The Fang Clan was one of the Four Great Clans, and at one time had in fact been the leader among those four clans. Therefore... it was hard to believe that, just like that, the clan would play out its final act.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked over at the fleeing Fang Wei, and his eyes gleamed with killing intent.</p>
 <p>“I can only stay in this state for seven more breaths of time....” he murmured. This was his most powerful state, and he could remain in it for a total of ten breaths. He took a deep breath, lifted his foot, and stepped forward.</p>
 <p>That one step caused everything to seem to shrink. Instantly, he was directly behind Fang Wei. That was a speed that exceeded minor teleportation. That was greater teleportation!</p>
 <p>Fang Wei was astonished to find Meng Hao suddenly right there. Meng Hao lifted his hand with indescribable speed and tapped Fang Wei.</p>
 <p>“Detonate!” he said softly, his eyes glowing with coldness.</p>
 <p>It was one word, but it echoed out in all directions, causing everything to shake. Divine Flame erupted around Fang Wei, prompting a wild howl. At the same time, Fang Wei performed a double-handed incantation gesture and spit out a mouthful of blood. Instantly, a blood-colored shield sprang up around him.</p>
 <p>Shockingly, as Fang Wei stood inside the shield, the image of an old man appeared in his right eye. As he sat there cross-legged, he opened his eyes, and terrifying ripples of the Ancient Realm spread out.</p>
 <p>Fang Wei had been completely pushed into a corner, so the Sixth Patriarch was forced to use his doppelgänger’s Essence power to fight back!</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the air, and Fang Wei coughed up another huge mouthful of blood. His chest sank inward, and the blood-colored shield expanded. Because of the resistance, the Essence of Divine Flame paused for a moment.</p>
 <p>In that brief moment, Fang Wei transformed into a flickering shadow, and fell back instantly, blood spraying from his mouth, seriously injured. His scalp was numb, and the figure in his right eye was dim. This was only a doppelgänger of the Sixth Patriarch, so he had very little Essence, which he had just used to escape the deadly crisis he had been in. However, in that moment, the power he was using to suppress Fang Wei’s soul also weakened.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Fang Wei’s soul appeared in his left eye, struggling. According to the plan, Fang Wei would never have fought back. However, the dramatic upheavals in the Fang Clan led to an unexpected turn of events.</p>
 <p>Fang Wei’s soul struggled awake and began to fight against the Sixth Patriarch’s possession, and over control of his own body.</p>
 <p>“Fang Hao, kill me!!” he cried, trembling. “I told you that if I lost, you could take back what belongs to you!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked on, taciturn, expression complex. He looked at Fang Wei’s eyes, then raised his right hand and waved it forward. 33 Heavens rumbled into being above Fang Wei’s head.</p>
 <p>Beneath his feet, 33 Earths appeared, transforming into a deadly snare!</p>
 <p>Rumbling echoed out as the 33 Heavens crushed down, and the 33 Earths exploded with power. A powerful aura rose up in Fang Wei, and he coughed up blood. The old man in his right eye seemed filled with madness and terror; he was about to fight back, when suddenly a brilliant light shone out from Fang Wei’s left eye.</p>
 <p>“I am Fang Wei, Chosen of the Fang Clan. If your purpose in possessing me is to sow chaos in the Fang Clan, then I would rather... allow the bad to be destroyed with the good, and die together with you!” His true soul, which resided in his left eye, suddenly rose up and began fight directly with the Sixth Patriarch for control of his body.</p>
 <p>He had always been matchessly proud, had always considered himself to be the only true Chosen of the Fang Clan!</p>
 <p>“Dammit!” raged the Sixth Patriarch. Originally, it wasn’t that he didn't want to destroy Fang Wei's soul; rather, to perform a perfect possession, he couldn’t do so, as he needed to slowly absorb the soul. He had never been worried about doing that, and yet, he had never imagined that Fang Wei’s devotion to the clan would suddenly supercede everything. In truth, he had forgotten about Fang Wei’s incredible pride.</p>
 <p>Fang Wei was a Chosen of the clan. He was willing to die in battle, to be possessed, or to slaughter others. He was willing to advance by hook or by crook. However, he was not willing... to betray the clan. His most important purpose was to protect the clan, and to ensure that the other clan members viewed him as a hero!</p>
 <p>He wanted to be the center of attention, the focus of the whole clan. He wanted prestige, and he wanted to become a powerful expert. He wanted to lead the clan into glory!</p>
 <p>In reality, he had been unaware of the true plans being laid by his grandfather.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s expression was a complicated one as he held his right hand up in the air.</p>
 <p>“Fang Hao, kill me! If I die, the Sixth Patriarch will be severely wounded. Perhaps the clan will have some hope then!! KILL ME!!”</p>
 <p>The Sixth Patriarch was going crazy. Fang Wei’s left eye was growing dim, as his soul fought desperately with the Sixth Patriarch for control of his body.</p>
 <p>Fang Heshan was still fighting with the Grand Elder, and when he saw the crisis Fang Wei was in, he let out a bellow of rage. Booms rang out from his body, and suddenly, a fragment of jade appeared in his hand. He crushed it violently, causing intense ripples to spread out. The Grand Elder’s face fell as he sensed the terrifying power in those ripples, and was forced to retreat.</p>
 <p>As he fell back, Fang Heshan shot toward Fang Wei.</p>
 <p>“Wei’er!!” Fang Heshan cried urgently.</p>
 <p>Even as he closed in, Fang Wei’s left eye began to shine brightly again. His left hand rose, trembling, and he pointed toward Fang Heshan. In that instant, the Yellow Springs appeared, along with his Immortal souls, all of which blocked Fang Heshan’s path.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa,” he said, his voice quavering, “sir, when I was born, do you remember why you gave me the character Wei 卫 as a name? Sir... you told me that it was because I needed to defend the Fang Clan.... Grandpa... stay your hand....” When Fang Heshan heard his words, he trembled, and grief appeared in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Fang Hao, you have to take my place... to protect the Fang Clan! Come on! Take back your Nirvana Fruits!” Fang Wei closed his left eye, and rumbling could be heard inside his body. A popping sound could suddenly be heard from his forehead. A split appeared, from within which two fruits emerged.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao instantly felt a sense of intense familiarity. He lifted his right hand up toward the two Nirvana Fruits, which flew directly toward him and landed in his palm.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Fang Wei coughed up a mouthful of blood, and his energy instantly weakened. The Sixth Patriarch let out a roar of defiance. Of his own initiative, Fang Wei shot toward Meng Hao’s divine ability. No one could prevent him from doing so, and not even Meng Hao could stop the 33 Heavens and 33 Earths from exploding violently.</p>
 <p>In that instant, the Sixth Patriarch in Fang Wei’s right eye transformed into a wisp of smoke that shot out. However, before it could escape, Fang Wei’s soul latched onto it and dragged it back.</p>
 <p>“NO!!” The Sixth Patriarch’s doppelgänger soul let out a howl of rage just as it was inundated by the rumbling 33 Heavens and 33 Earths.</p>
 <p>Massive booms filled the air, and then the 33 Heavens and 33 Earths faded away. Fang Wei's body fell down toward the ground. His right eye was completely dark; the Sixth Patriarch had been exterminated in body and spirit.</p>
 <p>Fang Wei’s left eye was fading. The flame of his life force was snuffed out. Right before he died, he looked at Meng Hao, and his lips moved. He wasn’t able to speak the words out loud, but Meng Hao understood exactly what he was saying.</p>
 <p>He said... “Defend the Fang Clan.”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Meng Hao thought back to what it was like on Planet East Victory hundreds of years ago. He and Fang Wei were children. Fang Wei had always been stubborn, different from the other kids. He wouldn’t follow Meng Hao around, but rather, spent time alone, in the shadows, working hard, trying to win the approval of others.</p>
 <p>He seemed gloomy, but in truth, he had worked extremely hard over the years. All of that led to the Fang Wei of today.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao remembered when they were both six years old, and it was time for them to begin practicing cultivation. They had stood in front of all the clan Elders, and been questioned about why they wanted to be cultivators. Meng Hao’s answer had been that after he grew up, he wanted to protect his dad and mom.</p>
 <p>As for Fang Wei, the words he had spoken with his tender, young voice seemed to echo now in Meng Hao’s ears.</p>
 <p>“My grandpa picked the name Wei for me! I'm Fang Wei, and when I grow up, I'm going to defend the clan!”</p>
 <p>The words Fang Wei had spoken as a child... were words that he had always remembered, even in the moment of his death!</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>Fang Wei slammed into the ground, and his aura was gone. He was dead!</p>
