<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Two people had been killed quickly and efficiently, causing Zhao Chunmu’s eyes to flicker slightly. However, his expression was the same as before.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Meng Hao released the head he held in his hand. Eyes flickering, he lifted his right hand up and then gestured toward the ground. Immediately, a blinding bloody light shone out from Meng Hao’s body, rotating to cover the area for dozens of meters in each direction. Within this Blood Death World, fifteen figures were instantly made visible.</p>
 <p>As soon as they appeared, Meng Hao stepped forward. With two fingers of his left hand emanating a will of blood, he tapped onto the forehead of one of the figures. A boom could be heard as, at the same time, he punched another of the figures with his right hand.</p>
 <p>Blood showered out everywhere, accompanied by one bloodcurdling scream after another. Meng Hao’s entire figure had turned the color of blood. He flicked his right sleeve as he reached out to grab another of the women. His left hand slapped his bag of holding to produce a medicinal pill, which he shoved into the mouth of the terrified woman.</p>
 <p>After the space of a few breaths, the woman’s body began to swell until it exploded, sending blood out for a dozen or so meters in every direction. Blood landed on four or five nearby assassins, causing the women to emit miserable shrieks as their bodies dissolved into pools of blood.</p>
 <p>“Poison Cultivator!!” cried the remaining four women. They were tall, slender and beautiful. As of this moment, though, their faces were completely filled with astonishment at seeing Meng Hao’s ruthless slaughter.</p>
 <p>Their faces were pale, and they immediately began to retreat. No longer were they attempting any sort of assassination, but instead were trying to flee what they now viewed as the most terrifying figure in existence.</p>
 <p>“Want to run?” said Meng Hao, his face expressionless. These women had bizarre forms; if it wasn't for the Blood Death World and Meng Hao’s faint Demonic Qi, he might not have been able to prevent them from getting close to him.</p>
 <p>Even as his words rang out, Meng Hao moved forward. As he neared them, the faces of the four women filled with despair. However, the hopelessness quickly changed into viciousness. Just when they were about to attack, Meng Hao smiled. Suddenly, the Blood Death World began to shrink. In the blink of an eye, it was as if a gigantic hand were clenching down viciously on the four women.</p>
 <p>A rumbling sound could be heard as the fist crushed them to death. Meng Hao floated in mid-air; the area for dozens of meters surrounding him was completely empty. No other person could be seen. The Scorpion Branch Cultivators off in the distance looked over at him, fear written across their faces.</p>
 <p>As for the members of the Five Tribes, they were starting to get excited, and continued on with their slaughter.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chunmu chuckled and coolly said, “It’s not over y….”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish speaking, his face suddenly filled with astonishment.</p>
 <p>Just now, a dark figure had appeared directly behind Meng Hao. It made no noise and let off no ripples, and was completely bizarre in appearance, like a ghost. It shot toward Meng Hao at incredible speed that almost looked like minor teleportation. However, just as the figure was almost upon Meng Hao, it let out a bloodcurdling scream. Its right hand, with which it had just been preparing to stab into Meng Hao’s back, was suddenly shredded to pieces as if by some massive rotating blade.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s right hand shot back and grabbed hold of the throat of this final, wounded assassin. Dragging her in front of him, he clenched his fist, and then looked over at Zhao Chunmu, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>When Zhao Chunmu saw the killing intent his heart was filled with coldness. Meng Hao had just killed eighteen Stealth Guards, which left Zhao Chunmu completely shaken. What he didn’t notice was that off to the side, on Zhao Youlan’s face, a sneer could be seen.</p>
 <p>He also didn’t notice that Zhao Youlan had quickly backed up even more, putting more distance between the two of them.</p>
 <p>“9 Grand Elders! Supreme Priest! Spare nothing. Kill that man!”</p>
 <p>In response to Zhao Chunmu’s words, ten figures immediately teleported toward Meng Hao. Nine of them were of the early Nascent Soul stage, one was of the mid Nascent Soul stage. The combined attack of this ten people was enough to shake Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>However, it was at this moment that suddenly, a bitter sigh could be heard echoing out from up above.</p>
 <p>“Tribe, I have protected you for many years, but unfortunately, I can accompany you no more…. Before I return to the dust, I will give you a final chance to live….” A rumbling sound echoed out that caused Meng Hao’s entire body to shake. He looked up to see that now, just like the Earth and Water totems of the Five Tribes, the Crow Scout Tribe’s Treant was breaking apart into death.</p>
 <p>As it died, vast quantities of life force turned into an aura which shot down toward the Five Tribes, fusing into their bodies and transforming into healing power.</p>
 <p>What was unavoidable, however, was that because of the death of the Treant, the totem tattoos on the members of the Crow Scout Tribe began to fade away. As they did, the Cultivation bases of the Crow Scout Tribe members began to show signs of dropping.</p>
 <p>Before that could happen, though, the Wood character totem tattoo on Meng Hao’s forehead began to emanate a mighty, glowing light. Suddenly, the illusory image of a massive tree magically appeared above his head.</p>
 <p>Close up, it looked like a great tree. But from a distance, it actually looked like the character ‘Wood.’</p>
 <p>Now, the Crow Scout Tribe members’ totem tattoos were no longer disappearing, but rather, transforming. In the space of a few breaths, the entire force of Crow Scout Tribe members felt their totems becoming stable. However, what they had were no longer Greenwood totems, but… the Wood totem that belonged to Meng Hao!</p>
 <p>This strange scene was something that even Meng Hao would never have imagined could happen. As soon as the Wood character totems appeared, a tremor ran through him as he suddenly realized he could sense all of the Crow Scout Tribe members. He could feel their zeal and passion. Furthermore, it seemed as if there was a continuous flow of life force being transmitted into his own body. At this moment, his aura suddenly expanded rapidly.</p>
 <p>His Wood-type totem tattoo emitted boundless, shocking light. Not only were the Five Tribes stunned, the Cultivators of the Scorpion Branch were shocked and in disbelief.</p>
 <p>Zhao Youlan’s eyes went wide, and she began to pant. Zhao Chunmu stared blankly, his eyes filled with incredulity.</p>
 <p>As Western Desert Cultivators, they all knew that totems… could only arise from neo-demons. Cultivators… practice Cultivation, and could never produce totemic power!</p>
 <p>What was happening exceeded anything they could ever imagine. What they were seeing could only indicate one thing: Meng Hao had become the Crow Scout Tribe’s totemic Sacred Ancient!</p>
 <p>His totem was now the Crow Scout Tribe’s totem! The explosive growth of his aura meant that… just like the magical totemic neo-demons, he could absorb the power of worship directed toward him by the Tribe members!</p>
 <p>It was mainly because of this incredible power that such neo-demons could bestow totems.</p>
 <p>Up above in the sky, where the battle of totems was taking place, a sigh could be heard. Down below, people began to express their shock.</p>
 <p>“Since he has become a totem, his totem is now the Sacred Ancient of the Tribe. He… can absorb our power!!”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that he’s not a Cultivator but actually a neo-demon?!?!”</p>
 <p>This shocking scene sent the entire battlefield into a completely commotion. One moment ago, the Crow Scout Tribe members were losing their Cultivation bases because of the death of their Sacred Ancient, the Treant. Now, their Cultivation bases were no longer disappearing. They were a bit weaker than before, but had not slipped down an entire stage.</p>
 <p>As of now, there was an indescribable connection between them and Meng Hao. They looked at him, their hearts filling with incredible zeal and reverence.</p>
 <p>“Sacred Ancient!”</p>
 <p>“We members of the Crow Scout Tribe offer our respect, Sacred Ancient!!”</p>
 <p>One by one, the members of the Crow Scout Tribe began to shout out, roaring. Instantly, they began to fight with increased ferocity.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was panting, and his mind reeled. But then, everything became clear. His eyes flickered as he took advantage in the sudden increase in his aura to point his hand up into the air.</p>
 <p>“Without a face!”</p>
 <p>An enormous face suddenly appeared, its eyes closed. A bloody glow rose up and spread out in all directions, transforming into attacking power that slammed into the nine Nascent Soul Cultivators who were charging toward him.</p>
 <p>Their faces flickered, and they immediately backed up in retreat.</p>
 <p>“A single word!” Meng Hao suddenly felt an unimaginable power welling up within him. He could sense that this power did not come from him, nor was it something he could store up or fuse with his Cultivation base.</p>
 <p>It was as if doing that would break some sort of rule, making it impossible to accomplish. This power was something he could only use, or perhaps borrow. It came from the members of the Crow Scout Tribe. There weren’t very many of them, only a few hundred, but their zeal made the power potent to a shocking degree.</p>
 <p>This borrowed power could sustain him and enable him to unleash the second form of the Blood Immortal divine ability that previously had sucked away at his life force!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s Spiritual Sense was also increased dramatically. He caused it to spread out, pointing out in front of him. Suddenly, the giant face that was currently beginning to break up, became clear. The eyes that had been closed before, opened, along with the mouth.</p>
 <p>It was like a sound came out, a strange sound that entered the ears of the people in the area. Each person heard exactly the same thing as Meng Hao pointed down toward the ground. The air there began to ripple. The face of the Scorpion Branch mid Nascent Soul stage Supreme Priest filled with disbelief.</p>
 <p>He suddenly began to tremble, as if he were being injured by some invisible force. He immediately began to back up, but before he could get farther than a few paces, blood sprayed from his mouth. Panting, his eyes filled with fear, and he hoarsely said, “Joss Flame! He can actually wield the power of Joss Flame! Only totem neo-demons can do that!!”</p>
 <p>The Supreme Priest wasn’t the only one to cough up blood. The faces of the other nine Nascent Soul Elders from the Scorpion Branch filled with shock and terror as they coughed up three successive mouthfuls.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao floated there, his hair whipping about, his clothes flapping. A strange glow shone in his eyes. With every breath he took, he could sense the power from the zealous Crow Scout Tribe members pouring into him.</p>
 <p>“Joss Flame, huh….” murmured Meng Hao. He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them. They were filled with a fierce glow.</p>
 <p>“Flames of war unify….”</p>
 <p>Without a face, a single word, flames of war unify! These were three Blood Immortal divine ability forms. Thanks to the power of the Joss Flame, Meng Hao… was now able to truly unleash the third form. Flames of war unify!</p>
