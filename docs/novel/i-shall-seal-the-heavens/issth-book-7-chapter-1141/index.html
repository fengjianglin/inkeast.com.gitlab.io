 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>Shocking azure light rose up into the sky!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao's body rapidly reverted from a height of 300 meters to only 150 meters. However, his cultivation base was rising dramatically.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, he then dropped from 150 meters tall to the size of an ordinary person. And yet, his energy seemed to stain the entire sky azure.</p>
 <p>“Azure Sky....” Meng Hao murmured. His mind trembled as a new enlightenment suddenly filled his mind. This was a sign that would definitely occur when an Allheaven Immortal appeared.</p>
 <p>At the same time, it was an innate divine ability of an Allheaven Immortal!</p>
 <p>Azure Sky!</p>
 <p>The Azure Sky subdues all willpower!</p>
 <p>Even the distant Mountain and Sea Realm was shaken. After all, despite the fact that the Windswept Realm was now high up in the darkness of the void, it was still... in the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>Since Meng Hao was now an Allheaven Immortal, it affected... the entire Realm.</p>
 <p>In the Mountain and Sea Realm, the Nine Seas were roiling and roaring. Countless sea beasts were filled with excitement, with the exception of the sea beasts in the Ninth Sea. Only the Ninth Sea... was trembling in fear, and that trembling was not limited to just the sea beasts in it!</p>
 <p>The entire Ninth Sea was suddenly struck with uncontrollable terror.</p>
 <p>Gradually, the Ninth Sea began to change color, turning azure. Any sea beast who had shown animosity to Meng Hao in the past suddenly found that they had azure sealing marks shining on their foreheads. The marks flickered several times before vanishing. However, the intense fear of extermination still floated in their minds.</p>
 <p>That was because of the oath that Meng Hao had made. His voice when he uttered that oath seemed to echo eternally within the Ninth Sea. [1. The oath made by Meng Hao regarding the Ninth Sea was in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-7-chapter-1068/" target="_blank">chapter 1068</a>]</p>
 <p>Similarly trembling were all the members of the Demonic Cultivator Horde in the Nine Seas God World. To them, it felt as if a horrific catastrophe was on the way, a massive calamity.</p>
 <p>The mountain peaks were also shaking. The Nine Mountains trembled, and all the cultivators in the Mountain and Sea Realm could sense something, although it was hard for them to put their fingers on exactly what. They just had the feeling that somewhere out there, an awe-inspiring figure had just appeared.</p>
 <p>The Mountains and Seas were shaken, and rumbling could be heard everywhere. The azure light was especially intense on Planet South Heaven, especially from all of the places there that Meng Hao had visited in the past.</p>
 <p>It was the same on Planet East Victory, as well as with Patriarch Reliance, who was now floating around somewhere in the Eighth Mountain and Sea. He trembled as azure light shone up from the State of Zhao on his back.</p>
 <p>Even more shocking was the Fourth Mountain, where Xu Qing sat cross legged in meditation. Suddenly, she was surrounded by shocking azure light. The old women standing guard over her were astonished, and even Ksitigarbha, the Lord of the Fourth Mountain and Sea, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Allheaven Immortal....” he murmured.</p>
 <p>As the Mountains and Seas rumbled, the sun and the moon suddenly stopped moving, and apparently broke free from their places in the Nine Mountains and Seas, and began to fly in the direction of the Allheaven Immortal aura.</p>
 <p>That scene caused widespread shock throughout the Mountain and Sea Realm. Back in the temple of the Windswept Realm, Meng Hao stood amidst the majestic azure light, and took a deep breath.</p>
 <p>“The first two Nirvana Fruits that I absorbed weren’t mine, but rather, the first generation Patriarch’s,” he murmured, eyes glittering brightly. “The next one I absorb will be... my very own Nirvana Fruit!”</p>
 <p>He took a step forward, and thunder crashed. Rumbling echoed out in all directions as that single step took him all the way to the temple, where he waved his right hand toward the temple itself and made a snatching motion.</p>
 <p>What he wanted was... the supreme Dao which existed in the temple itself.</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the temple. Meng Hao’s hand was filled with Allheaven Immortal power, and yet, it couldn't shake the temple. All it did was cause fissures to spread out, accompanied by cracking sounds.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao frowned in displeasure. In contrast, the emperor’s face fell. He couldn’t see anything in the world except for Meng Hao, surrounded by azure light, and that most holy central temple.</p>
 <p>“He... actually caused cracks to appear on the surface of the temple. A cultivation base like that... such battle prowess... he’s basically equivalent to the peak of the Ancient Realm! He’s just half a step away from Quasi-Dao!”</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, Dao-Heaven roared anxiously, calling upon even more qi flow to rapidly increase the speed of his enlightenment!</p>
 <p>2,900 Essences!</p>
 <p>3,000!</p>
 <p>After reaching 3,000 Essences, he threw his head back and let loose a long cry. A strange light appeared in his eyes; he had never before been so clear about his future path. His energy continued to rise, and cracking sounds emanated out from his body. His cultivation base suddenly experienced explosive growth, rising higher and higher. In the blink of an eye, it was far beyond its previous level.</p>
 <p>By means of divine will, he had found his own path, which would change how he practiced cultivation. From here on out, he would travel the correct path, and would experience incredible cultivation base growth.</p>
 <p>His energy soared as he transformed into a beam of light that shot toward the temple.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao, that supreme great Dao belongs to me, Dao-Heaven!”</p>
 <p>He closed in on Meng Hao with incredible speed, waving his right hand to cause a huge handprint to appear. That handprint seemed large enough to support the Heavens, and it immediately began to slap down toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Screw off!” Meng Hao said coolly. As the hand closed in, azure light burst out. Suddenly, all of the light in the entire world turned azure.</p>
 <p>There was a flash, and Dao-Heaven’s eyes went wide with disbelief. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he was flung backward like a kite with its string cut.</p>
 <p>“Y-you....” he stammered, astonished. He suddenly realized that Meng Hao was vastly more powerful than he had been before. Even though he himself was also stronger, he simply couldn't measure up to Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>In almost the same moment that Dao-Heaven fell back, Lin Cong threw his head back and roared. A massive tempest sprung up around him as he gained enlightenment of 3,000 great Daos. His eyes shone with a bizarre light, and his energy soared along with his cultivation base. At the same time, he shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao!” he roared. He waved his right hand, causing numerous screaming ghosts to fly out, covering the sky and emanating an aura of death. They transformed into a gray mist that in turn became a long spear which stabbed toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>However, in the moment that the long gray spear bore down on him, Meng Hao waved his finger. Thunderous booms rang out, and blinding azure light flashed. The gray spear collapsed into countless fragments, and Lin Cong fell back, blood spraying out of his mouth, his face a mass of astonishment and disbelief.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao didn't even look at Dao-Heaven or Lin Cong. Instead, he lifted his left hand and once again slapped out toward the temple. A huge boom echoed out, and the temple trembled. Cracks appeared everywhere, and it appeared to be just on the verge of collapsing.</p>
 <p>He wanted to destroy the temple completely and forcibly take that supreme Dao out!</p>
 <p>Dao-Heaven’s eyes flickered coldly. “We can't let him get it!” he cried. “We should all have a chance to have it. Lin Cong, let’s attack him together!”</p>
 <p>As far as he was concerned, now that Meng Hao had the Echelon Heart, if he also got that supreme World Essence Dao, then he would definitely be the most powerful member of the Echelon!</p>
 <p>In fact, it could potentially even make him the most powerful Immortal Realm cultivator in all the successive generations of the Echelon!</p>
 <p>Dao-Heaven roared, charging forward and waving his hand to summon his Paragon magic. The scroll painting unfurled, and the figure within looked up.</p>
 <p>Lin Cong’s eyes flickered with killing intent. He had long since come to view the enmity between himself and Meng Hao as irreconcilable. Meng Hao had fractured his Dao heart, and had left behind a seemingly unconquerable shadowy version of himself. If he hadn’t been able to acquire enlightenment of 3,000 great Daos… he likely wouldn’t even have had the courage to make a move. Gritting his teeth, he roared and unleashed his own Paragon magic.</p>
 <p>As the two of them attacked, Han Qinglei threw his head back and let loose a long cry. He was the fourth Echelon cultivator to achieve enlightenment of 3,000 Essences. Energy soaring, cultivation base rising explosively, he looked viciously at Meng Hao and flickered as he charged toward him in attack. As he flew through the air, he waved his hand, causing innumerable bones to appear around him, as well as green lightning.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao, it’s time for us to fight again!”</p>
 <p>Three Echelon cultivators were all joining forces to attack Meng Hao at the same time.</p>
 <p>Any of these three Echelon cultivators could be considered blazing suns. When they appeared on the scene, all cultivators would tremble at their strength. They had long since surpassed their own Realm. Ancient Realm cultivators, even late Ancient Realm experts, would quiver in fear upon facing them.</p>
 <p>However, considering that Meng Hao’s current cultivation base was equivalent to the peak Ancient realm, just half a step from Quasi-Dao, that meant that all he had to do was absorb another Nirvana Fruit, and he would be able to tackle almighty Quasi-Dao experts.</p>
 <p>In fact, if he absorbed a fourth Nirvana Fruit, and his cultivation base broke through from the Immortal Realm to the Ancient Realm, then despite being in the Ancient Realm, he would still be able to hold his own against the Dao Realm.</p>
 <p>In the Mountain and Sea Realm, the Dao Realm experts were all people on the same level as the Patriarchs of the most powerful sects and clans.</p>
 <p>You could say that Meng Hao had already reached a level in which he could cause just about everyone to tremble. He was a terrifying figure that nobody could afford to underestimate.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao radiated azure light as he calmly faced the three incoming Echelon cultivators. He seemed threatening without being angry, a true Immortal of Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>“Before,” he said coolly. “I became a mountain obstructing the paths of the Chosen of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Today... I will become a towering peak that stands in the way of all of this generation of Echelon cultivators in the Mountain and Sea Realm!” He shot out in a flash to meet Dao-Heaven and the others. As the four of them closed in on each other, Meng Hao waved his finger toward Han Qinglei.</p>
 <p>Han Qinglei screamed, and his Paragon magic collapsed. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he tumbled away.</p>
 <p>Then Meng Hao struck out toward Lin Cong with his palm. That palm strike caused Heaven and Earth to fade, and became Lin Cong’s entire world. His Paragon magic shattered, and he was utterly incapable of defending himself. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he screamed as he spun backward, out of control.</p>
 <p>All of these things occurred in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint! Then Meng Hao turned to look at Dao-Heaven, and struck out with his fist.</p>
 <p>That fist caused everything to shatter. The statue in Dao-Heaven’s painting emanated a murderous aura, but before it could be completely unfurled, Meng Hao’s eyes flickered, and he looked at Dao-Heaven and softly said, “Withdraw!”</p>
 <p>The one to withdraw was not the painting, it was Dao-Heaven!</p>
