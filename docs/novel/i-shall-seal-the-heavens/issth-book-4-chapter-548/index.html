 <p><strong>Chapter 548: Return to the Black Lands</strong></p>
 <p>Naturally, the Li Clan Patriarch was the first to receive the honor of becoming one of Meng Hao’s Souls of Lightning. He had long since enjoyed quite a bit of freedom, and was quite comfortable in the Blood Immortal mask. As long as he wasn’t being struck by lightning, or tormented by the meat jelly, he was actually quite happy.</p>
 <p>He had long since abandoned any expectations of Li Clan members coming to rescue him. He felt numb toward any such hopes. Recently, his greatest enjoyment came from tormenting Ji Nineteen.</p>
 <p>Being able to take the pain he had suffered and inflict it exponentially on someone else made the Li Clan Patriarch more happy than he had ever been.</p>
 <p>Of course, Ji Nineteen was fated to become Meng Hao’s second Soul of Lightning, although not voluntarily. In fact, it had taken quite a bit of pleading on the part of the Li Clan Patriarch to convince Meng Hao to bestow such an honor upon Ji Nineteen….</p>
 <p>The third Soul of Lightning was of course Patriarch Huyan, who had just been pulled into the blood-colored mask, completely out of sorts and on the verge of dissipating completely.</p>
 <p>As soon as he saw Patriarch Huyan, the Li Clan Patriarch grew extremely excited, and his body started to crackle with lightning.… Once the torment began, it naturally couldn’t be minimized in any way.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao retracted his Divine Sense from his dantian region, having finished his observations of his seven Nascent Souls refining the glowing Wheel of time. He floated there in mid air, the Blood Mastiff next to him, licking its wounds. A brutal expression filled its eyes. It could sense that Meng Hao’s killing intent had not faded, but instead, had grown more powerful as they carried out their slaughter.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s gaze swept across the Violet Sea. Patriarch Huyan’s clone had not possessed a bag of holding. At first, Meng Hao did not understand why that was. However, after borrowing the power of Spirit Severing, he suddenly understood.</p>
 <p>Some Spirit Severing experts might use bags of holding, but most of them opened up a space in their Nascent Divinity. This was another difference between the mortal and the Immortal.</p>
 <p>However, Meng Hao had destroyed ten outposts, and killed many Cultivators. Within the bags of holding he had collected were a host of items, which helped make up for everything he had wasted to acquire his seventh Nascent Soul.</p>
 <p>Voices could be heard as the members of the Golden Crow Tribe approached. They looked at Meng Hao with excited expressions. They had stayed off in the distance for the course of the battle, and hadn’t been able to see what was happening. However, they could sense the shocking nature of the magical battle.</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure what percentage of true Cultivation base was possessed by Patriarch Huyan’s clone….” Meng Hao mused to himself. “However, this clone was clearly different from the average clone.” He smiled. It didn’t really matter what percent power the clone had, or how much Patriarch Huyan’s true self possessed. Meng Hao would not shrink back from a fight just because his opponent was powerful.</p>
 <p>“Those other three Spirit Severing experts sure were interesting. Patriarch Huyan seemed to have some ulterior motive in asking them to attack. It seems all Spirit Severing experts are filled with schemes and foresights. I definitely cannot look down on them.” After a moment’s thought, he looked down toward the Golden Crow Clan members down below, and his eyes glittered brightly.</p>
 <p>“Let us return… to the Black Lands!” he said. He waved his right hand, causing the entire Violet Sea to fill with a rumbling sound. An enormous Violet Sea Giant suddenly rose up. Water poured off of its surface, crashing down onto the surface of the sea below. Next, a second, then a third Violet Sea Giant appeared.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, there were seven. Seven towering Violet Sea Giants, each one three thousand meters tall. Although their facial features were somewhat indistinct, it was obvious that they resembled Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao sat cross-legged on the mastiff as it flew through the air. The Violet Sea Giants began to run, kicking up huge waves, which swept the members of the Golden Crow Tribe along with them as they headed toward the Black Lands.</p>
 <p>From a distance, it was also possible to observe the Violet Sea seethe as Meng Hao sent his will expanding out.</p>
 <p>A wave sped out across the Violet Sea, causing countless specters appear on the surface of the waters. By the time the wave reached Blackgate Fort, their numbers had grown into the hundreds of thousands.</p>
 <p>Some of the specters began to congregate around the seven Violet Sea Giants as they all charged toward the Black Lands.</p>
 <p>They proceeded forward with the power to crush anything. Nothing could possibly obstruct their path. Roaring echoed out constantly, to the point that the Black Lands were now on high alert. All the powers therein were sent into a commotion.</p>
 <p>When the seven Violet Sea Giants appeared off in the distance, the tens of thousands of Cultivators gathered atop Blackgate Fort could only watch out as if they were facing an incredible foe. Down below, massive waves surged across the surface of the sea.</p>
 <p>It was in this moment that one particular enormous, furious wave smashed into Blackgate Fort. The resulting boom rose up to the sky, and Blackgate Fort itself shook. The surrounding mountains trembled, and massive rockslides occurred. The people gathered atop Blackgate Fort were astonished.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Blood Mastiff screamed through the air, Meng Hao seated cross-legged atop it. A few dozen Cultivators flew out to block the way.</p>
 <p>However, in the instant that they appeared, the Blood Mastiff let out a huge roar. A Spirit Severing aura appeared, along with an Area. Booms could be heard as the dozens of Nascent Soul Cultivators were sent tumbling back, blood spraying from their mouths, their faces filled with astonishment. Their disbelief and terror couldn’t be greater.</p>
 <p>“A Spirit Severing neo-demon!!”</p>
 <p>“That’s… a Spirit Severing Beast!!”</p>
 <p>Even at the same time that the Nascent Soul Cultivators were retreating, the mastiff roared again and shot through the great gate of Blackgate Fort and into the Black Lands. Simultaneously, seven Violet Sea Giants leaped out from within the waves, also passing through the gate into the Black Lands.</p>
 <p>“What… what are those? They’re giants made from the Violet Sea?!?!”</p>
 <p>“He… he can actually control the Violet Sea!!”</p>
 <p>“That’s impossible! How could someone control the Violet Sea! Hey, I recognize him! That’s the totemic Sacred Ancient of the Golden Crow Tribe….”</p>
 <p>When the seven Violet Sea Giants stepped foot onto the Black Lands, everything quaked. Even as the Black Lands Cultivators atop Blackgate Fort were sent into an astonished commotion, Meng Hao’s voice could be heard echoing out.</p>
 <p>“I am the totemic Sacred Ancient of the Golden Crow Tribe. The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe wants to eradicate my Golden Crow Tribe. That is the only reason I have come to the Black Lands this day. I will wipe out the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe!</p>
 <p>“I’ve already exterminated Patriarch Huyan’s clone. If any Tribes here stand in my way, I will see to it that the ruthless Violet Sea spreads throughout all the Black Lands!” In response to his words, enormous waves rose up on the Violet Sea outside Blackgate Fort. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of specters whistled through the air to enter the Black Lands.</p>
 <p>Even as Meng Hao’s words rang out, the seven Violet Sea Giants took booming strides forward. Hundreds of thousands of specters screamed through the air, obscuring the sky above. All of this caused the tens of thousands of Cultivators to gasp. Not a single one of them made any move to stop Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>They were simply... incapable of doing so. Whether it was in terms of the seven Violet Sea Giants, the hundreds of thousands of specters, the Spirit Severing Beast or the roaring Violet Sea outside of Blackgate Fort, all of it… was far beyond anything that they could do anything to resist.</p>
 <p>That was especially true considering what Meng Hao had just said. The fact that he had slaughtered Patriarch Huyan’s clone transformed into a roaring that filled their minds and hearts. In fact, many of them… simply couldn’t believe it.</p>
 <p>Regardless, none of them could block Meng Hao’s way. It was without hesitation that tens of thousands of Cultivators immediately began to send news of what was happening back to their respective organizations. As to how each individual Tribe would respond, that would be up to the leadership of the Tribe.</p>
 <p>What happened next astonished everyone. Without exception, all of the Tribes immediately responded to the messages with strict orders not to participate in any way in the conflict between the Golden Crow Tribe and the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe.</p>
 <p>As he moved on, Meng Hao did not meet any interference. All the Black Lands Tribes made way for him. Booming echoed out as the seven Violet Sea Giants stomped through the land.</p>
 <p>Hundreds of thousands of specters obfuscated the sky as they flew along. As for Meng Hao’s Blood Mastiff, wherever it passed, a matchless aura would spread about. On this day… Meng Hao’s name thoroughly shook the entirety of the Black Lands.</p>
 <p>With Wu Ling providing directions, Meng Hao headed directly toward the area of the Golden Crow Tribe, where the war was still underway.</p>
 <p>The Black Dragon Tribe had left, reducing by thirty percent the force that had once been the Golden Crow Black Dragon Clan. The Golden Crow Tribe’s battle power had been significantly reduced. Furthermore, they had already been fighting for more than half a month.</p>
 <p>It left the Golden Crow Tribe with roughly 50,000 members, almost all of whom had been mobilized. Vast amounts of neo-demons fought viciously. Big Hairy and the other totemic Sacred Ancients fought like mad, seemingly unaware of their own exhaustion.</p>
 <p>As for the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, they had mobilized nearly all of their forces. There were more than 100,000 Cultivators, along with massive hordes of neo-demons, along with totemic Sacred Ancients. As the two sides battled back and forth over the days, heavy casualties had been inflicted on both sides.</p>
 <p>Originally, the Golden Crow Tribe would not have been a match. However, the Thorn Rampart vine had continued to follow the mission it had been entrusted with by Meng Hao all those years ago. It surrounded the Golden Crow Tribe, causing thorns to spread out. Over and over again it had blocked the deadly attacks of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe.</p>
 <p>Blood soaked the ground as the war between the two parties slowly raged into a fever pitch. Booming echoed about as people died left and right.</p>
 <p>The spell formation of the Church of the Golden Light was another reason that the Golden Crow Tribe had been able to hold their ground for so long. The attacks of the parrot, meat jelly and Outlander Beast also turned the battlefield with the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe into a sea of blood.</p>
 <p>Both sides fought with bloodshot eyes. Neo-demons flew about in mid-air massacring each other.</p>
 <p>However, as time had passed, the situation for the Golden Crow Tribe continued to grow more critical.</p>
 <p>Currently, more than a hundred Nascent Soul Cultivators of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe flew about in mid-air, emitting truly crushing pressure. There were also more than twenty totemic Sacred Ancients, who, although were not of the Spirit Severing stage, only the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, were still astonishingly powerful.</p>
 <p>When you added in the ordinary Cultivators and the roaring neo-demons, it caused the sky to dim.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe was a great Tribe after all, with deep, powerful resources. Considering that the entire Tribe had been mobilized, the Golden Crow Tribe fundamentally weren’t a match for them. They had no choice but to slowly fall back into the perimeter of the Thorn Rampart. All the neo-demons and Cultivators were deeply exhausted, but not in despair.</p>
 <p>Within the confines of the Tribe, the Tribe members gathered around Meng Hao’s statue and called out the name of their Sacred Ancient. It was at this point that they began to feel their blood burn with righteousness. They felt just the way they imagined the old-timers, who were now the leadership of the Tribe, must have felt during the days of the migration.</p>
 <p>However, the situation continued to decline. The protective Thorn Rampart began to show signs of collapse, although… it continued to hold on.</p>
 <p>Big Hairy and the Wild Giant continued to fight on, absolutely no fear of death within their hearts. They fought with madness, with determination, also incapable of forgetting the mission Meng Hao had entrusted them with. Even if they died, they would continue to protect the Golden Crow Tribe.</p>
 <p>Big Hairy, covered in blood, howled as he fought. The Wild Giant lost an eye, but was still as fierce as ever.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, within the forces of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, Zhang Wenzu looked coldly out across the battlefield. [1. Zhang Wenzu was present on the day Meng Hao led the Tribe to Blackgate Fort. He was introduced in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-4-chapter-510/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 510</a>, where he had some interaction with Duo Lan of the Demon Butterfly Tribe. He had some minor reactions to the battle in subsequent chapters, and then made a comment in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-4-chapter-515/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 515</a> about wanting to fight Meng Hao]. He then waved his right hand, snatching up a member of the Golden Crow Tribe by the neck. He squeezed down violently. Cracking sounds could be heard as the neck was crushed.</p>
 <p>He suddenly cried out: “Tower Toppling Tribe, Cloud Mountain Tribe, Nine Crystals Tribe. The three of you, attack the right flank!</p>
 <p>“Flying Cloud Tribe, Vast Mountain Tribe, Peng Lai Tribe, attack the left flank!</p>
 <p>“This battle is about to end! Members of the main Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, attack the center…. Crush the Golden Crow Tribe. Men, women, elderly, children… don’t leave a single one alive!” Killing intent flickered in Zhang Wenzu’s eyes. He, of course, was the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe Chosen who was taking the lead in the battle.</p>
