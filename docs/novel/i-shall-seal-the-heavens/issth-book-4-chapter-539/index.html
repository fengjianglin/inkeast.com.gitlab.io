 <p><strong>Chapter 539: Slaughtering the Outposts!</strong></p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s voice was like a cold wind that blasted out in all directions. He pointed with the index finger of his right hand, causing a massive collection of Violet Qi to amass up ahead and form into the shape of a blade. It shot forward directly toward the peak late Nascent Soul Cultivator who had just spoken.</p>
 <p>The Cultivator’s face fell as he heard Meng Hao’s cold, echoing words. His scalp went numb and he shot backward in astonishment, both hands performing an incantation gesture. Vast quantities of magical items appeared as he attempted to fight back.</p>
 <p>When all of his defenses met Meng Hao’s Violet Qi Guillotine, it was clear that they were so weak they couldn’t stand up to a single attack. One after another, they shattered into pieces. Booms could be heard as the Violet Qi Guillotine sliced through the body of the Cultivator.</p>
 <p>Blood exploded out into the air. The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe Cultivator trembled and looked down to see that his body had been completely cut in two. Even his Nascent Soul was destroyed.</p>
 <p>The corpse splashed down into the Violet Sea and the mastiff let out another astonishing roar. The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe city guards in the outpost began to bleed from their eyes, ear, nose and mouth. One by one, regardless of the level of their Cultivation base, they dropped dead.</p>
 <p>Regarding the other Cultivators in the city, Meng Hao didn’t kill them.</p>
 <p>He strode down from off of the mastiff until he stood in front of the fifty Golden Crow Tribe members strung up within the outpost.</p>
 <p>More than twenty of them were already dead. The rest slowly opened their listless, sallow eyes. When they saw Meng Hao in front of them, they gaped.</p>
 <p>Among the group were two old ones whose bodies began to tremble. Their eyes filled with unprecedented emotion.</p>
 <p>“Exalted… exalted Sacred Ancient!!”</p>
 <p>“Senior, it’s you….”</p>
 <p>These two old ones had accompanied Meng Hao during the long migration and campaign of war of the Crow Divinity Tribe. They almost didn’t dare to believe what they were seeing. They had never imagined that it might be possible see their Sacred Ancient once again during their lives.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked back at them, and his expression softened. “It’s me. I’ve… returned.”</p>
 <p>He waved his right hand, sweeping up all the Golden Crow Tribe members into a wind that gently placed them onto the ground. The wind carried life force which nourished them. Wu Ling and the others who were being carried along by the wave instantly rushed over.</p>
 <p>Excited shouts instantly could be heard from the members of the Golden Crow Tribe. Many of these people had never seen Meng Hao before, only his statue. However, as soon as they heard his words, indescribable emotions filled the hearts of everyone present. “Exalted Sacred Ancient… we offer our sincerest greetings!”</p>
 <p>As for the old people, it suddenly caused them to recall all the struggles of the past years.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked at them with similar thoughts. However, when he saw the corpses of the Tribe Members who had not survived, his heart filled with stabs of pain. His rage toward the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe grew only more intense.</p>
 <p>“I’ve returned to take you with me… to collect a blood debt!” He turned and flew back up into the air. The Violet Sea roared as it swept up the Tribe members. Together, they moved onward.</p>
 <p>Shortly thereafter….</p>
 <p>The Blood Mastiff roared toward the first outpost. Massive paws rose up to attack the spell formation. A boom could be heard as it shattered into pieces. The Heavenly Court Alliance Cultivators who were maintaining it instantly exploded, destroyed in body and spirit.</p>
 <p>As soon as Meng Hao arrived, the slaughter began. It didn’t matter the Cultivation base involved. Core Formation. Nascent Soul. Any member of the Heavenly Court Alliance in the ten outposts who had dared to string up the Golden Crow Tribe members… were swept over by Meng Hao and exterminated.</p>
 <p>The Tribe in control of the first outpost was the Wild Flame Tribe of the Heavenly Court Alliance. They watched the slaughter in shock. Two middle-aged men with the highest Cultivation bases recognized who Meng Hao was, and knew of his hatred and desire for revenge against the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. It was without hesitation that they instantly turned and fled.</p>
 <p>However, before they could get very far, two enormous arms suddenly stretched up from within the Violet Sea. The men were grabbed and then violently crushed. Bloodcurdling screams rang out, but were quickly cut off.</p>
 <p>The wooden planks of the outpost ran with blood, which then flowed down into the Violet Sea.</p>
 <p>After rescuing the Golden Crow Tribe members, Meng Hao led them all to the third outpost. Then the fourth, and the fifth….</p>
 <p>Everywhere he went, the slaughter rose up to the sky. However… no amount of killing appeared capable of lessening Meng Hao’s fury. Instead, he began to grow even more berserk.</p>
 <p>The reason was because each outpost he went to, he found more and more corpses of the Golden Crow Tribe, and fewer survivors. In fact, at the eighth outpost, of the group of fifty, all had passed away. The corpses had even begun to rot.</p>
 <p>The sight of it caused Meng Hao’s body to tremble. He felt as if his entire person were on fire. Among the dead Tribe members were five whose faces he recognized. They had died with their eyes open, and within those eyes could be seen an enmity and desire for revenge that could not be wiped away even by death.</p>
 <p>They would not close their eyes, nor would Meng Hao force them to. He would allow these dead Golden Crow Tribe members to watch with their own eyes as the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe was eradicated.</p>
 <p>Only then… could they close their eyes in death and be content.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao flicked his sleeve and then headed toward the ninth outpost.</p>
 <p>By now, several days had passed. Meng Hao was sure that his appearance had been noticed by certain parties. If his suppositions were correct, Patriarch Huyan would be arriving soon.</p>
 <p>And that was exactly what Meng Hao was waiting for! Patriarch Huyan was of the Spirit Severing stage, but…. So what!?</p>
 <p>With the mastiff here, and Meng Hao being the master of the Violet Sea, he could battle with the Spirit Severing stage. Not fighting was something he couldn’t comprehend. Not fighting would leave his heart unsettled. Not fighting… was something he refused to do!</p>
 <p><em>You want to drag me into the matter? Well, since there is no way to avoid a fight, then all of my explanations are useless. Fine, then… let’s fight!</em></p>
 <p><em>Patriarch Huyan, I am in the Violet Sea, waiting for you!</em></p>
 <p>To Meng Hao, the Violet Sea was the most advantageous location to do battle. That was why he he had exterminated the members of the Heavenly Court Alliance in the outposts. He wanted the battle to be fought in the Violet Sea, not the Black Lands.</p>
 <p>“You’ve forced me to fight, Patriarch Huyan. Well then, I will force you to fight on my home ground!” Despite the fact that his fury boiled up into the Heavens, Meng Hao was as calm as ever. He knew that his current actions would quickly be relayed to Patriarch Huyan, who would personally come, and soon.</p>
 <p>The Devil Spear appeared in Meng Hao’s hand. He hurled it out, causing a towering mist to appear as it shot toward the ninth outpost. By this point, Meng Hao had possessed the Devil Spear for more than a hundred years. Despite the fact that he had been in secluded meditation most of that time, the spear had continued to fade away.</p>
 <p>Even still, after a hundred years had passed, it had not faded away completely.</p>
 <p>The power of the spear slammed into the spell formation, inside of which were the Heavenly Court Alliance Cultivators of the ninth outpost, all ready to do battle.</p>
 <p>It was impossible to tell exactly how the Heavenly Court Alliance had pulled it off, but there were even Cultivators inside who were not of the alliance, staring out at Meng Hao with intense killing intent. Within their eyes was also greed. There were seven hundred people in total, all of them brimming with the desire to slay Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Obviously, they had been promised of an enticing reward by the Heavenly Court Alliance if Meng Hao were to be killed.</p>
 <p>As the Devil Spear neared, an arrogant voice rang out from within the outpost.</p>
 <p>“Pour full power into the spell formation! Patriarch Huyan knows that this villain is here, and is on his way!!”</p>
 <p>BANG!!</p>
 <p>Even as the voice echoed out within the spell formation, the sound of an explosion rang out, interrupting the words. The spell formation shook violently; at the same time, vast quantities of black mist spread out, causing the spell formation to erode. Countless vicious faces could be seen consuming everything.</p>
 <p>In only the space of a few breaths, the spell formation grew incredibly weak because of the corrosion of the Devil Spear. The faces, filled with excitement and persistence, suddenly burst through and shot toward the seven hundred Cultivators. Miserable screams suddenly lifted up into the air.</p>
 <p>The area of the spell formation that the Devil Spear had struck corroded away until there was a huge hole. The black mist suddenly congealed together into the form of a face, exactly the same face that had belonged to the Devil Construct from years ago.</p>
 <p>The face, filled with a greedy thirst for blood, transformed into a devilish mist that spread out to cover the entire ninth outpost. The only safe place was the location where the Golden Crow Tribe members were.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao floated in mid-air. This was the first time he had completely wiped out the population of an entire outpost. In this case, these Cultivators had made their own choice to deliver themselves up to death.</p>
 <p>The black Devil Spear mist roiled and churned. Intense, bloodcurdling screams could be heard for a few moments. Suddenly, seven or eight figures shot out from inside. Even as they did, Meng Hao waved his hand, causing them to scream and then explode into pieces.</p>
 <p>The surrounding Violet Sea surged up with huge waves that submerged the outpost. The black mist shrank down to surround the Golden Crow Tribe members and bring them to Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>There were only eight Tribe members who were still alive. As Meng Hao treated their injuries, his killing intent grew even more intense.</p>
 <p>He turned, returning to stand on the mastiff’s head. A great wave rose up in the Violet Sea to take the Golden Crow Tribe members as they headed toward the last of the outposts.</p>
 <p>Almost in the same moment in which Meng Hao headed off, a black beam suddenly appeared near the Black Lands. It employed speed that far exceeded the Nascent Soul stage, even employed greater teleportation as it moved.</p>
 <p>Within the black beam was a man wearing a black robe. This was apparently nothing more that Patriarch Huyan’s clone!</p>
 <p>His face was grim, and he did not speak. His body flickered as he teleported, growing ever nearer to the tenth outpost.</p>
 <p>“Qing’er,” he murmured, “today, father will achieve only half of the vengeance you deserve. Soon, I will find the person who actually killed you, and that person will die the most cruel death imaginable.</p>
 <p>“Qing’er, no one in the world is qualified to kill you. Only me… Only I have that right.” His eyes were filled with kindness. For some reason, however, the kindness was bizarre. Anyone who saw it would feel cold, and their hair would stand on end in terror.</p>
