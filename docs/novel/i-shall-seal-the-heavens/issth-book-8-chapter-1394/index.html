 <p>“All of my plans were centered around the Fang Clan’s... Nirvanic Rebirth!” Even as the words left his mouth, Shui Dongliu suddenly looked up toward the apex of the starry sky, and a mad fire seemed to be burning in his eyes!</p>
 <p>It was in that exact same moment that the highest point of the starry sky suddenly distorted and twisted, and the starry sky even seemed to melt. Then, it spread apart to reveal... a portion of the Vast Expanse beyond.</p>
 <p>There was also an enormous land mass speeding forward, a continent!</p>
 <p>The land mass was gargantuan, and was filled with innumerable mountains and seas. Up in front were nine huge suns, dragging it along. Rumbling sounds echoed out in all directions as it approached the Mountain and Sea Realm at incredible speed!</p>
 <p>It was none other than... the Immortal God Continent!</p>
 <p>This was one of the two major powers which had destroyed the Paragon Immortal Realm, the Immortal God Realm!</p>
 <p>Each of those nine suns emanated the aura of a Paragon. Thunderous rumbling echoed out, the starry sky melted, and the Ninth Mountain shook. Even just the mere pressure which was weighing down was enough to threaten to destroy the Ninth Mountain.</p>
 <p>The Mountain and Sea cultivators’ minds were spinning as they stared in shock at what was happening. As for Meng Hao, he looked up and stared at the source of the chaos in the starry sky... the enormous, shocking land mass.</p>
 <p>An enormous statue was visible on that land mass, depicting a man with a calm expression and ordinary features. However, the pressure that radiated off of him was impossible to describe.</p>
 <p>Almost in the same instant that Meng Hao saw the statue, his eyes narrowed. This statue looked familiar to him. It looked... exactly like the statue of the black-robed Slaughter from Echelon cultivator Dao-Heaven’s Paragon magic! The only difference was that apparently, the two of them had different personalities!!</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the nine suns all appeared within the starry sky of the Mountain and Sea Realm. Behind them, innumerable cultivators could be seen on the land mass, patiently waiting in battle formation, apparently completely prepared to wage war.</p>
 <p>Scintillating energy filled the air, as though this land were the king of all Heaven and Earth, to whom myriad worlds would prostrate, with boundless Immortal qi and towering Godly power. It could shake the Vast Expanse, change time, and alter space. It could even look down upon the great Daos of Heaven and Earth. From the look of it, not even the Vast Expanse could cause this world to feel fear!</p>
 <p>It was as if it... were the pinnacle force in the starry sky.</p>
 <p>Compared to it, the 33 Heavens were like nothing!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an icy cold voice echoed out from the huge land mass, to fill the whole Mountain and Sea Realm. “Paragon Immortal Realm, hand over the precious treasure, destroy your Immortal meridians, and become a Lower Realm. You have no hope of winning this war!”</p>
 <p>A moment later, the voice of a woman could be heard, somewhat suspicious, but also, seemingly pleased! “Hmm, what is that aura…? Demon....”</p>
 <p>Chuckling and whimpering, Meng Hao swished his sleeve, and as he looked up at the boundless land mass up above, his eyes glowed with a more intense redness than before. He licked his lips, and an air of madness began to emanate out.</p>
 <p>“Are you people happy now too?” he murmured. “Are you at ease?”</p>
 <p>The descent of the huge land mass caused the Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators to awaken from their shock from what had just occurred with Meng Hao. The astonishing land mass caused them to feel pressure like Heavenly Might. Despair instantly rose up in the hearts and minds of the cultivators, and simultaneously, the army of Outsiders began to tremble, quickly edged backward, and then dropped to their knees to kowtow.</p>
 <p>The 8-Essences Paragon had a very serious look on his face, and inwardly, he was sighing with relief. He really had no desire to tangle further with Meng Hao in combat. Meng Hao was like a nightmare, and thus, he couldn't be happier to clasp hands and bow deeply to the incoming land mass.</p>
 <p>Only Dao Fang reacted differently. His eyes flickered with a strange light, and he didn't so much as bend his waist as he stood there. In fact, a slight glimmer of displeasure appeared in his eyes.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that Shui Dongliu began to laugh loudly, and his eyes glittered as he watched the Immortal God Continent descending, and more specifically, one corner of it that was already completely within the starry sky of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>Even as his laughter echoed out, he suddenly spoke.</p>
 <p>“You owe me! One attack! Sever the corner of that land mass!” Even as Shui Dongliu’s voice echoed about like thunder, a black-robed figure appeared at the apex of the starry sky, right near the corner of the land mass that was jutting into the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>He was blurry, making it impossible to see his face clearly. However, as soon as he appeared, an enormous murderous aura roiled out, shaking Heaven and Earth. Even the huge land mass began to vibrate.</p>
 <p>The black-robed man calmly lifted his hand into the air, then chopped it down toward the huge land mass.</p>
 <p>It was impossible to determine exactly the quantity or nature of the divine abilities and magical techniques he used, or if he had used any at all. In fact, it seemed like just a simple chopping motion, yet it caused the entire land mass to shake violently. Countless cultivators immediately began to cry out in alarm, and numerous shocking defensive mechanisms were unleashed, defenses that even a Paragon would be hard-pressed to obliterate. In fact, those defenses were what had made this land mass virtually invincible on its journeys through the Vast Expanse.</p>
 <p>But now, they seemed to do no good. They could do nothing to defend against this blow, and in fact, an enormous crevice opened up on the corner of the land mass that was inside the Mountain and Sea Realm’s starry sky.</p>
 <p>The crevice grew wider, turning into a vast gulch. Mountains toppled, seas were parted, and plains were shattered!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, that huge corner of the land mass, which was larger by far than any of the 33 Heavens, began to completely tear away from the land mass as a whole, as if it was being pried off!</p>
 <p>The land mass... was being split apart!</p>
 <p>The entire world was completely shaken!</p>
 <p>The Outsiders’ jaws dropped, and the 8-Essences Paragon stared, eyes wide with disbelief. Even Dao Fang was so shocked that his fur stood on end.</p>
 <p>Only Meng Hao reacted differently. The flames of madness in his eyes burned bright, and he began to cackle uproariously.</p>
 <p>That chopping motion severed an entire section of the huge land mass, which was something that caused the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm and the forces of the 33 Heavens to gasp in incredulity.</p>
 <p>The cultivators of the Immortal God Realm were dumbstruck, and the entire land mass was completely shaken. For something like this to happen went completely beyond the expectations of the cultivators there, and they didn't even have time to react to it.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as the severed corner of the land mass lost its ability to sustain flight, and began to fall down toward the Mountain and Sea Realm. The countless cultivators on that corner instantly flew out, and at the same time, the black-robed man turned to leave.</p>
 <p>The entire time, he hadn’t spoken a single word, neither had anyone seen his face. The Immortal God Continent had only just appeared, and was already severely damaged, leaving them in a complete rage.</p>
 <p>“Think you can just leave?!?!” someone roared as more than ten figures charged toward him. Shockingly, nine of those figures were the ones within the suns, and the entire group all erupted with Paragon power.</p>
 <p>As they closed in, the black-robed man frowned and stopped in place. Then he turned his head, allowing the Paragon level experts to see his face. It was none other than Slaughter.</p>
 <p>In that moment, the numerous Paragons felt their minds spinning, as though countless lightning bolts were striking them. They all lurched to a stop, gasping, expressions of complete disbelief covering their faces as they began to cry out.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch!!”</p>
 <p>“What... what..? The Patriarch!?!?”</p>
 <p>“It's the Patriarch!!!” Even as their shocked voices rang out over the Immortal God Continent, more figures emerged and sped toward the area. There were men and women, old-timers and youngsters, but all of them were extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>Slaughter didn't do anything more than look at them before striding off and vanishing.</p>
 <p>“Success or failure will be determined by this one opportunity!” Shui Dongliu said, swishing his sleeve and looking in the direction of the rest of the land masses belonging to the 33 Heavens. “Windswept! When do you plan to make your move if not now!?!?”</p>
 <p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the 8-Essences Paragon’s face flickered, as did those of the other Outsider experts in the army. They had been aware that Windswept could be a traitor, and had even prepared for such an outcome. However, Shui Dongliu’s words seemed to be filled with complete and utter confidence.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, that huge corner of the land mass, which was larger by far than any of the 33 Heavens, began to completely tear away from the land mass as a whole, as if it was being pried off!</p>
 <p>What mattered was that the 33rd Heaven, the 32nd Heaven, the 31st Heaven... in fact, all of the remaining Heavenly land masses, began to rumble and shoot toward... the severed corner of the enormous land mass which was falling down through the starry sky.</p>
 <p>This scene caused the Mountain and Sea cultivators’ hearts to tremble. A collective gasp could be heard from the Outsider army. The 8-Essences Paragon was enraged, and even the monkey Dao Fang was astonished.</p>
 <p>The experts from the Immortal God Continent had exactly the same reaction, and quickly tried to unleash their power to interfere. However, Slaughter’s strike had not just severed the corner, it had also contained some sort of sealing power which was just enough to temporarily prevent the experts from the Immortal God Continent from invading.</p>
 <p>It was in that exact same moment that the Heavenly land masses began to slam into the severed corner of the Immortal God Continent. Intense rumbling sounds echoed out that could shake Heaven and Earth as the severed portion of the land mass was crushed into rubble. Simultaneously, the Heavenly land masses were also destroyed, transforming into nothing more than ash.</p>
 <p>The collision caused all of the Immortal qi which had been part of that corner of the land mass to be released into the Mountain and Sea Realm, Immortal qi that was so powerful it was difficult to put into words.</p>
 <p>The land masses of the 33 Heavens which were destroyed also unleashed an aura which merged with that Immortal qi, filling the starry sky of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>As soon as those auras merged, a huge blast resulted, which ripped open part of the starry sky, and beyond it, the Vast Expanse.</p>
 <p>This was what really mattered!</p>
 <p>What really mattered... was this unprecedented blow struck by the land masses!</p>
 <p>Amidst rumbling sounds, an enormous hole was opened up. Instantly, the starry sky trembled, and the Outsiders were thrown into shock. The 8-Essences Paragon was astonished, and the experts on the Immortal God Continent let out incredulous shouts.</p>
 <p>“They’re opening the seal! They’re going to make a run for it!”</p>
 <p>From the look of it, that hole opened up into a tunnel!</p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 1394: Slaughter Slashes the Immortal Gods!</strong></p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p><strong>Note from Deathblade:</strong> Although it's been touched on in the story already, I feel it's necessary to point out that Slaughter, despite being a clone of Wang Lin, is NOT Wang Lin. The details of Slaughter's story, and why he is so different from Wang Lin, will be revealed as the translation of Renegade Immortal continues to unfold. As far as ISSTH is concerned, it's enough to know that he looks like Wang Ling but is definitely not him in personality, thinking, or anything like that.</p>
