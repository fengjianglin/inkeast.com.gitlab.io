 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as the sound echoed out, all of the Dao Realm experts in the Ninth Mountain and Sea were shaken. At the same time, a shocking image appeared in their minds.</p>
 <p>It was an image of the general location Meng Hao currently occupied in the Ruins of Immortality!</p>
 <p>Obviously, the image was a form of guidance, telling the Dao Realm experts that the Outsiders... were in the Ruins of Immortality!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, roughly half of the Dao Realm experts suddenly stepped out into the starry sky and began to speed in that direction. Fang Shoudao was one of them. He and the experts from the Three Great Daoist Societies were among the first to head toward the Ruins of Immortality.</p>
 <p>On Planet North Reed, the Patriarch and others from the Li Clan also headed in the direction of the location of the image they had seen.</p>
 <p>This sudden turn of events shocked them all to the core, and was clearly not a plot by the Ji Clan. This matter... was momentous. Not even the Ji Clan would have the gall to scheme in this way.</p>
 <p>At the same moment in which the Dao Realm experts employed their top speed to head toward the Ruins of Immortality, the old man who was facing off with Patriarch Reliance felt his scalp go numb, and his face go pale. He was well aware of the danger they were now in because of Yi Fazi revealing his true form.</p>
 <p>“Moron! Imbecile!” the old man raged inwardly. “Accursed, Heaven-damned Zheng Clan! You were all like this back then, and now this kid is the same! Fool! Moron!!” At the same time, he was extremely apprehensive and nervous. He knew all too well what would happen after Yi Fazi revealed his true form. He also knew that even though only nine mountains remained of the Immortal World, and that it was no longer the grand entity which ruled over 3,000 Lower Realms… even still, the Paragon Immortal Realm still held powerful entities that caused his scalp to go numb.</p>
 <p>The old man was also well aware of the deep-seated and complex hatred that the people from the Paragon Immortal Realm harbored against the other two major forces from that ancient war. However, even more importantly, he knew that what the Paragon Immortal Realm hated more than anything else was not those two other powers, but rather... all of the Lower Realms which rebelled against the Immortal World in the war!</p>
 <p>The Spiritstar Realm was one of those Lower Realms!</p>
 <p>The old man gnashed his teeth and completely ignored Yi Fazi. He backed up rapidly, waving his hand to cause the ship to appear. As soon as he set foot inside, he turned the ship around and began to flee.</p>
 <p>He intended to employ the fastest speed possible to escape from this world before any of the other cultivators from the Ninth Mountain and Sea could react to his presence. Based on the level of his cultivation base, he could already sense the auras of numerous powerful experts flying in his direction.</p>
 <p>Those people, he could afford to ignore. However, he could also sense that somewhere out there, there was an even more fearsome existence that permeated the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p>
 <p>“The Lord of the Ninth Mountain and Sea... Ji Tian! That moron Yi Fazi really screwed things up this time!” The old man’s face was grim, and he gritted his teeth as he sent the ship flying forward. Then he bit the tip of his tongue, then spit out some blood, even burning some of his longevity to achieve a temporary burst of speed. He ripped through the starry sky at incredible speed, piercing out into the void. In a flash, he was on the verge of merging into the void itself.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that, deep within the Ruins of Immortality, in what seemed to be an ordinary Immortal’s cave, a white-robed woman sat cross-legged in meditation. She slowly opened her eyes, and they glinted with icy cold light.</p>
 <p>It was a coldness that encompassed hatred, rage, and the desire to kill. She slowly lifted her right hand and waved her finger toward the void.</p>
 <p>That finger caused an illusory thread to snake out into the distance. In the blink of an eye, it pierced through the entire Ruins of Immortality, slashing through the void toward the old man and his ship.</p>
 <p>The old man hadn’t noticed anything strange happening, and was just on the verge of disappearing, when all of a sudden, his face fell. He was about to turn to look behind him when... his head flew off of his shoulders and blood sprayed up like a geyser.</p>
 <p>The thread, like a long strand of hair, flashed past and then disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>The old man’s eyes went wide and his head tumbled through the void, causing his view of the world around him to spin about. He was baffled about what had happened until the moment he died, when he suddenly realized the truth.</p>
 <p>“Para... gon....” The old man’s head transformed into ash along with his body.</p>
 <p>The ship was now no longer capable of merging into the void, and gradually became visible again. Patriarch Reliance glanced at it and then gobbled it up. After he swallowed it, a tremor ran through him. He looked at the vanishing strand of hair, then peered deep into the Ruins of Immortality, his expression somewhat blank.</p>
 <p>He suddenly seemed to have recalled something important from the distant past, but no matter how much he tried to think about it, everything was vague and blurry.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao also saw the old man die, and his heart trembled. Then he looked into the depths of the Ruins of Immortality, and recalled that woman in the white robes.</p>
 <p>When Yi Fazi saw his Dao Protector die, his scalp went numb, his mind filled with roaring, and his expression was one of fear. He had never had any sense of awe regarding the Nine Mountains and Seas, but now... he was absolutely terrified.</p>
 <p>“W-what... what power was that? It actually killed my Dao Protector in one blow!!” Yi Fazi was panting, and his eyes were wide as his heart pounded loudly.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, numerous legends regarding this place began to rise up in his mind. He began to shiver, and slowly backed up. The only thing on his mind now was to flee. All of his surging power and momentum from before now collapsed and faded away.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered. For the moment, he didn't even think about Li Ling’er. Considering Yi Fazi’s true form, as well as the words which had just been spoken, along with the intense killing intent from the Demon Sealing Jade, there was no way Meng Hao was going to allow him to get away. There were too many things he wanted to know, answers... that Yi Fazi could provide!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao didn't even pay attention to the opportunity Patriarch Reliance now had to escape. He instantly flashed through the air in pursuit of Yi Fazi.</p>
 <p>Now that Yi Fazi had changed form, he had experienced an increase in both cultivation base and speed. In a short moment, he was quite a distance away. Rumbling filled the air as he also sped away at top speed.</p>
 <p>He was scared, and the main thing he was concerned about was escaping Meng Hao. Then he would find a secluded place where he could figure out a way to return home. At the moment, he had no idea how he would do that. However, his Dao Protector was dead, and he had no desire to end up the same. Trembling, he screamed inwardly.</p>
 <p>“Dad will definitely sense that my Dao Protector is dead! He’ll come save me! All I have to do is find a place to hide, and Dad will eventually find me!</p>
 <p>“Damned Immortal World. Screw this place! Why couldn’t it have been completely destroyed all those years ago!?!?</p>
 <p>“And then there’s that damned Meng Hao. I’m not such a bad guy, why does he have to push things so far!?” Cursing inwardly, Yi Fazi increased his speed. Meng Hao chased him, and the two of them proceeded deeper into the Ruins of Immortality.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Reliance blinked a few times. Looking enraged, he made to follow Meng Hao, but actually flew slower and slower. At the same time, his voice grew louder and louder.</p>
 <p>“Stop running! The Patriarch is definitely going to catch you!</p>
 <p>“Still running!? You’re really pissing me off! I’m gonna chase you down with all my might!</p>
 <p>“I'm mad as hell now!” As he roared, Patriarch Reliance’s beady eyes darted back and forth. Eventually, Meng Hao disappeared off into the distance, whereupon Patriarch Reliance did an about-face, employing his top speed to flee in a different direction.</p>
 <p>The parrot and meat jelly were still on top of him, as was Li Ling’er. They watched in shock as Patriarch Reliance took to flight.</p>
 <p>After a few breaths of time, Patriarch Reliance used some unknown method to appear in another area of the Ruins of Immortality. Then, he shook the continent on his back, causing the parrot and meat jelly, as well as Li Ling’er, to be flung off of him.</p>
 <p>“SCREW OFF!!!” he roared. “From here on out, the Patriarch is footloose and fancy free! Hahaha! Yet again, the Patriarch is the smartest of all. He knows how to take advantage of all opportunities!</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao you little bastard, you just wait! Our business isn't finished!!</p>
 <p>“I hereby swear that this time, you’ll NEVER find me, you son of a biscuit!!” Patriarch Reliance was virtually dancing about. He threw his head back and roared. Having tossed Li Ling’er, the parrot, and the meat jelly aside, he then sped off into the distance.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, in another location in the Ruins of Immortality, Meng Hao’s killing intent raged into the Heavens. His cultivation base exploded with power, and the 33 Heavens surrounded him. However, Yi Fazi was moving with incredible speed. Although they were able to fight back and forth a bit, Yi Fazi never slowed down. Nevertheless, under the relentless pursuit, his injuries began to accumulate.</p>
 <p>Even so, he used some unknown secret magic that eventually caused his speed to accelerate explosively. There were even many points where he was about to shake Meng Hao off his trail. However, each time Meng Hao was also able to use the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex to continuously break his momentum and allow him to make up for lost ground.</p>
 <p>Several days of chasing went by. Eventually, they reached an area where a gargantuan floating head rose up just ahead of them.</p>
 <p>The head had eyes that looked like black holes, as if someone had dug the eyeballs out in years past. Although it was a complete head, there was actually a huge fissure which split it from the crown of the head down.</p>
 <p>Also, a miserable and ancient will seeped out from inside of the head.</p>
 <p>As the head neared, an incredible pressure weighed down, forcing Yi Fazi to slow down. When that happened, his face fell.</p>
 <p>It was in that instant that Meng Hao closed in from behind. Lifting his hand, he unleashed the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex.</p>
 <p>As soon as he waved his finger, Yi Fazi’s body trembled.</p>
 <p>“Not good!” At the same time, killing intent erupted in Meng Hao’s eyes. He raised his right hand, causing the Star Plucking Magic to grab toward Yi Fazi.</p>
 <p>Yi Fazi threw his head back and howled. Innumerable beams of black light began to emanate off of him, transforming into countless black bats which then shot madly toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as Yi Fazi borrowed the force of the collision and once again shot forward. He was just on the verge of evading the Star Plucking Magic, when Meng Hao’s hand grabbed onto his wings. He wrenched viciously, and Yi Fazi let out a miserable shriek as the wings were ripped off of him. Blood sprayed out of the wounds, and Yi Fazi's face went ashen. He staggered backward, gritting his teeth and speeding away.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s killing intent hadn’t lessened in the least. The Demon Sealing Jade was vibrating more madly than ever as he put the severed wings into his bag of holding. Eyes shining as cold as knives, he once again gave chase.</p>
 <p>It was at this same time that the Dao Realm experts began to enter the Ruins of Immortality and search for the Outsiders. The shrill cry of the Xuanwu turtle continued to echo out.</p>
 <p>Until all the Outsiders were dead, it would never return to sleep.</p>
