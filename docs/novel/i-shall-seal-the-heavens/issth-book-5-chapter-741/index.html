 <p><strong></strong></p>
 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>The Blood Demon Grand Magic had six levels in total!</p>
 <p>The Qi and Blood stratum, the Spirit Meridians stratum, and the Blood Soul stratum!</p>
 <p>Three grand strata, designed to strengthen the fleshly body, the cultivation base, and the soul!</p>
 <p>The first stratum allowed the cultivator to temper the fleshly body to a virtually limitless level of power that could shake Heaven and Earth. The second stratum was even stronger; cultivation bases of others could be absorbed, providing a temporary increase in one’s cultivation base.</p>
 <p>Limits could be exceeded, and one could temporarily achieve a pinnacle of power!</p>
 <p>As far as the third stratum, the Blood Soul stratum, went, Meng Hao wasn’t too clear about the details. According to the description of the Blood Demon Grand Magic, the third stratum had something to do with the soul, and divine will.</p>
 <p>What he did know was that the 3rd stratum of the Blood Demon Grand Magic had its own unique name.</p>
 <p>It could form divine will into clones, and butcher Immortals with a single thought!</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled Meng Hao’s body. As he looked out over the chaos of the battlefield, his energy surged, and his eyes radiated an unprecedented glow that caused the Golden Frost Sect puppet’s heart to tremble. The Li Clan cultivator’s pupils constricted, and as for the Solitary Sword Sect’s early Dao Seeking expert stuck in the golden vortex, his mind reeled, and a sense of grave danger welled up from his heart.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao slowly raised his hand up and pointed at the man.</p>
 <p>“Die!” he said.</p>
 <p>In response, the vortex began to spin even faster, transforming into a cyclone that seemed to stretch from the land all the way up into the sky. Viewed from a distance, it was shocking to the extreme, and all the cultivators on the battlefield, both the Blood Demon Sect disciples and the forces from the four great powers, were astonished.</p>
 <p>The Solitary Sword Sect cultivator was no longer visible inside the tempest. Only a desolate shriek could be heard from within the raging winds. Vast quantities of qi and blood transformed into a bloody haze that flowed out from the tempest toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>By this point, Meng Hao’s entire fleshly body had already reached the Dao Seeking stage. At the same time, vast amounts of cultivation base power surged into him from the tempest, pushing his own cultivation base up into the third Severing!</p>
 <p>Inside the tempest, the Solitary Sword Sect cultivator was experiencing unbelievable pain. His fleshly body withered rapidly, and he was transformed into a living corpse in the blink of an eye!</p>
 <p>A tremor ran through Meng Hao, and a shocking aura suddenly rose up from his body that could be felt by everyone on the battlefield.</p>
 <p>The aura was not Spirit Severing, but… Dao Seeking!</p>
 <p>Finally, the golden vortex faded away, revealing the Solitary Sword Sect cultivator. He was nothing but skin and bones, and possessed not even a bit of cultivation base. His life force barely flickered; he had lost everything!</p>
 <p>He was incredibly weak, virtually a mortal, without even the strength to retrieve any magical items from his bag of holding. Even his Nascent Divinity was completely withered.</p>
 <p>Shock filled his eyes; everything had happened so quickly that he could scarcely believe it had actually occurred. As the vortex disappeared, Meng Hao sped forward to appear directly in front of the old man. Then he reached out and pushed down on top of the man’s head.</p>
 <p>Hundreds of thousands of cultivators all looked on, their faces awash with astonishment, shock, terror and disbelief.</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>The early Dao Seeking expert from the Solitary Sword Sect exploded, sending blood and gore showering out in all directions, which then… transformed into ash that dissipated in the wind.</p>
 <p>The entire battlefield went silent.</p>
 <p>Only a withered Nascent Divinity remained behind, looking confused and terrified. He tried to flee, but before he could put much distance between himself and Meng Hao, killing intent flickered in Meng Hao’s eyes. He raised his right hand, and the flag of three streamers appeared. It swept out, filling the area with rippling blackness that then wrapped around the withered Nascent Soul. Then it jerked him back toward Meng Hao, sealing him up inside the flag.</p>
 <p>Deathly silence reigned….</p>
 <p>The Golden Frost Sect puppet gasped and fell into retreat. The other Golden Frost Sect cultivators who comprised the other puppets had looks of astonishment and disbelief on their faces. A powerful expert of the early Dao Seeking stage had just been slaughtered in front of their eyes.</p>
 <p>The Li Clan cultivator stared with wide eyes.</p>
 <p>The deathly silence only lasted for a few moments, after which an explosion of reactions occurred.</p>
 <p>“Early Dao Seeking….”</p>
 <p>“Dead?!”</p>
 <p>“A mighty Patriarch of the Solitary Sword Sect just perished!!”</p>
 <p>None of them dared to believe what they had just witnessed.</p>
 <p>Even as they reeled in shock, they stared over at Meng Hao. The image of him standing there was something they would never be able to forget for the rest of their lives.</p>
 <p>The Blood Demon Sect disciples were quivering in excitement, and began to shout out to Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Blood Prince!”</p>
 <p>“Blood Prince!!”</p>
 <p>“BLOOD PRINCE!!!” The sound surged out over the battlefield, transforming into countless echoes which caused everything to shake.</p>
 <p>The slaying of the early Dao Seeking cultivator caused the Blood Demon Sect disciples to be more roused than ever. Meng Hao looked up. Now that he could wield the fourth level of the Blood Demon Grand Magic, he was completely confident that he could fight back against the hundreds of thousands of enemies.</p>
 <p>He strode forward and then transformed into a savage beam of light that shot toward the Li Clan cultivator.</p>
 <p>As rumbling filled the air, the Li Clan cultivator’s face fell. He immediately fell into retreat, not daring to get close to Meng Hao. He was completely terrified of the Blood Demon Grand Magic vortex.</p>
 <p>Despite his fleeing at top speed, he wasn’t faster than Meng Hao’s Blood Demon Grand Magic. Meng Hao waved his hand, and three golden vortexes appeared, which descended toward the hundreds of thousands of enemy cultivators.</p>
 <p>Immediately, miserable shrieks rang out as the three vortexes enveloped several hundred enemy cultivators. Immediately, their bodies withered up, and their cultivation bases vanished. Qi and blood and spirit meridians were extracted and shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>His fleshly body grew stronger!</p>
 <p>His cultivation base rose to shocking heights!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao advanced at top speed and then pointed out toward the fleeing Li Clan cultivator.</p>
 <p>Eighth Demon Sealing Hex!</p>
 <p>Demonic qi swept about, silk-like, entangling the Li Clan cultivator in the blink of an eye. His body stopped in mid-air. He struggled, and seemed just on the verge of breaking free, but the price he paid for that brief pause….</p>
 <p>Was that Meng Hao had time to unleash the Blood Demon Grand Magic vortex!</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>As soon as the vortex appeared, the Li Clan cultivator screamed. He threw out numerous magical items, and fully employed all the power of his cultivation base, but if the early Dao Seeking expert from the Solitary Sword Sect couldn’t avoid perishing, how could he, with his slightly lower cultivation base?</p>
 <p>As the shrieks rang out, the Golden Frost Sect puppet looked on, eyes wide. The Li Clan cultivator withered up, and his cultivation base was dissolved. The cultivators in the puppet felt their scalps go numb, and they retreated at top speed.</p>
 <p>Within the space of a few breaths, the Li Clan cultivator’s entire cultivation base, and all of his qi and blood, were absorbed by Meng Hao. Then Meng Hao waved his hand, and what remained of the Li Clan cultivator exploded into bits.</p>
 <p>“Kill them!” roared Meng Hao, which further roused the spirits of the surrounding Blood Demon Sect disciples. There were tens of thousands of them, and they were facing hundreds of thousands of enemies.</p>
 <p>And yet… the death of the early Dao Seeking expert from the Solitary Sword Sect, the fall of the Li Clan Elder, the retreat of the Golden Frost Sect puppet, along with all of the shocked Spirit Severing cultivators attempting to escape, caused the forces of the four great powers to be profoundly shaken and, apparently, lose their will to fight.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Meng Hao’s Blood Clone was still pouncing from cultivator to cultivator, draining them dead. All of this sapped the energy of the hundreds of thousands of enemies. For the first time, the Blood Demon Sect… forced the enemy forces into retreat!</p>
 <p>If you likened the enemy forces to a fist, then Meng Hao had taken that fist… and pried it open!</p>
 <p>Seeing the sudden shift in events down below, the old black-robed Solitary Sword Sect cultivator up in mid-air let out a bellow of rage. “You’re courting death, kid!”</p>
 <p>The Li Clan Patriarch also roared in fury. They wanted to charge down to attack Meng Hao, but Patriarch Blood Demon’s clones clearly would not allow them to do any such thing. Echoing booms filled the air, and the air was distorted and warped.</p>
 <p>“Dammit!” cried the black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect. “Dawn Immortal, you promised to help!”</p>
 <p>As soon as his voice rang out, a faint sigh could be heard echoing down from up above. It swept across the lands, causing the minds of all the cultivators to reel, both the hundreds of thousands of enemies, and the Blood Demon Sect disciples. Their minds trembled, and then went completely blank.</p>
 <p>The Resurrection Lily suddenly appeared behind Meng Hao, looking incredibly vicious, with its tentacles whipping about madly. Meng Hao looked up into the sky, his eyes filled with grim killing intent.</p>
 <p>Up above, a woman could be seen. As she strode down from the sky, flowers blossomed beneath her feet, and a shocking energy swirled faintly around her.</p>
 <p>She was not beautiful, but had striking, unusual features which would cause anyone who looked at her to feel a breathtaking attraction to her.</p>
 <p>Her appearance instantly caused quite a stir on the battlefield. Patriarch Blood Demon’s clones looked up, and their eyes all came to focus on the woman.</p>
 <p>“Dawn Immortal,” he said.</p>
 <p>“Blood Demon!” she replied.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Blood Demon’s clones all merged together into a single clone. That single clone emitted a powerful aura, which transformed into an enormous, blood-colored face that hovered in mid-air.</p>
 <p>“A measly clone?” said Patriarch Blood Demon. He looked over at the Solitary Sword Sect expert and the others. “This is your trump card?” His gaze shifted back to the woman. “That leaf earlier was your handiwork, too, I presume.”</p>
 <p>“Under different circumstances,” she responded, “I would be incapable of dealing with you, Senior Blood Demon. But now you are bound by an aura of death. You are simply too weak, Senior. If I remember correctly, the Blood Demon Grand Magic can only be utilized by one person in any given age. You haven’t used it during the battle, only that child down there has…. Although, that doesn’t really matter. All I need to do is delay you for a bit.” She suddenly looked down toward the ground, and Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked back up at her, and his mind trembled when their eyes met. An incredible pressure suddenly weighed down on his mind, as if an entire mountain were crushing down onto him.</p>
 <p>Behind him, the Resurrection Lily was writhing about madly.</p>
 <p>“Dawn Immortal!!” he thought, staggering backward. Despite the fact that blood oozed from his mouth, he continued to stare at the woman up above. He would never forget the feeling of that gaze, the same gaze that had fallen upon him when he was in the Milky Way Sea!</p>
 <p>This woman was none other than the mysterious Dawn Immortal, although it was not her true self, but merely a clone!</p>
 <p>“The good part of me gave you her life force,” the woman said coolly. “My son is now your Spirit Severing Treasure…. You and I really are connected by destiny.”</p>
