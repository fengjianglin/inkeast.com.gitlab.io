 <p><strong>Chapter 1555: Summoning the Mountains and Seas!</strong></p>
 <p>The Mountain and Sea Realm with its Nine Mountains and Nine Seas was originally a precious treasure forged by Paragon Nine Seals when his world was being destroyed, for the purpose of fighting back against the two major powers and the rebel forces.</p>
 <p>It was as powerful as a cultivator half a step into Transcendence, which was how it came to be a safe haven for later generations, and even prevented the other major powers from entering.</p>
 <p>As time went on, the Mountain and Sea Realm continued to protect the cultivators who lived within it, until the great war occurred over two thousand years in the past. During that time, the Ninth Sea turned traitor, and numerous other events led to the Mountain and Sea Realm being destroyed.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, the destroyed remnants were scattered hither and thither.</p>
 <p>But now, Meng Hao had created a vortex that sent the entire starry sky rumbling, and caused all of the scattered remnants to turn into dazzling beams of light that converged together, causing the Mountain and Sea Realm to once again form in front of the eyes of all present.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Meng Hao wasn’t just putting the pieces back together, he was using the power of Transcendence, and his Demon Sealing Hexing magic, to completely remodel the entire realm.</p>
 <p>This really and truly was... using Hexing magic as the bones, and the Mountains and Seas as the flesh!</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the First Mountain and Sea appeared. Then, Meng Hao’s voice echoed out and shook the starry sky. Natural laws were altered, and magical laws were torn apart. The cultivators clustered around Meng Hao continued to kowtow excitedly.</p>
 <p>That was especially true of those who had fought in the Mountain and Sea War. The cultivators who originally came from the First Mountain and Sea were nearly hysterical, and couldn’t hold back from weeping. As the First Mountain and Sea and its planets were formed, they could finally see the home that they remembered from so long ago.</p>
 <p>It was a new Mountain and Sea Realm, and from now on, the First Mountain and Sea would embody Meng Hao’s First Hex, the Beginning-Ending Hex!</p>
 <p>Cultivators there would have innate superiority when it came to that Beginning-Ending Hex. As that superiority developed and expanded, one could easily imagine the final result!</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the newly remoulded First Mountain and Sea also came to be responsible for the seasonal transformations in the Mountain and Sea Realm. The way that spring, summer, fall, and winter occurred on the First Mountain and Sea would affect the entire Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>Furthermore, whoever became the Lord of the First Mountain and Sea would have ultimate control over all beginnings and endings!</p>
 <p>People only continued to be more and more shaken as more and more rubble gathered in the area. Rumbling sounds then echoed out as Meng Hao’s voice once again replaced the will of the starry sky, speaking out new natural laws for the Mountains and Seas!</p>
 <p>“Second Mountain and Sea! I call upon the power of my name to take the power of the Second Hex, the Real-Unreal Hex, and embody it in the Second Mountain and Sea. Henceforth... you are the Real-Unreal Mountain and Sea! You are responsible for all clarity in the Mountain and Sea Realm, ensuring that all Mountain and Sea cultivators can distinguish between what is real and what is unreal, can think clearly, and remove inner devils!</p>
 <p>“Cultivators in this Mountain and Sea may cultivate my Real-Unreal Hex and gain enlightenment of the Essences of reality and unreality. This hex will now be called the Second Hex of the Mountains and Seas!” Meng Hao’s words echoed like Heavenly thunder, and at the same time, countless complex ancient magical symbols appeared, which converged behind the First Mountain and Sea. Soon, the shape of the Second Sea and the Second Mountain took shape.</p>
 <p>At the same time, more and more of the fragments of the Mountains and Seas began to form around the magical symbols. Soon, the Second Sea and the Second Mountain fully formed!</p>
 <p>The Heavens shook and the starry sky trembled as the Second Mountain and Sea appeared!</p>
 <p>Planets also formed around the Second Mountain!</p>
 <p>The Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators were cheering in excitement at the shocking sight. As for the cultivators who had originally come from the Second Mountain and Sea, they were weeping with joy.</p>
 <p>In the future, those who practiced cultivation in the Second Mountain and Sea would have superior command of the Daos of reality and unreality. They would be able to dispel delusions with ease, and would exceed others in understanding of magical illusions.</p>
 <p>The Second Mountain and Sea was responsible for clarity, ensuring that the Mountain and Sea Realm remained free of inner devils. It would protect the cultivators of the realm, and ensure that their practice of cultivation went smoothly. The benefit to the Mountain and Sea Realm as a whole would be no less than that provided by the First Mountain and Sea.</p>
 <p>Whoever was Lord of the Second Mountain and Sea would have control over the inner devils of all cultivators in the Mountain and Sea Realm. Without the Second Mountain and Sea, it would be very difficult to dispel such inner devils!</p>
 <p>It was as if a new age were dawning. One could easily imagine how a Transcendence Treasure like this could be used, not necessarily just for fighting, but for causing its entire people to rise to new heights of glory.</p>
 <p>This was a Mountain and Sea Realm forged specifically for its people, forged to create a new world of cultivation!</p>
 <p>It was a level of grandeur that Paragon Nine Seals had only partly attained. Meng Hao was using the power of Transcendence to create a new Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>“Third Mountain and Sea!” he roared. Brilliant light shone off of him, making him look like a divine being. He waved his finger at the vortex, eyes shining with a strange light, making him look so glorious that even the stars would bow to him.</p>
 <p>“I call upon the power of my name to take the Third Hex, the Present-Ancient Hex, and embody it in the Third Mountain and Sea. Henceforth... you are the Present-Ancient Mountain and Sea, responsible for Time magic within the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>“Cultivators in this Mountain and Sea may cultivate my Present-Ancient Hex, and gain enlightenment of the Essences of present and ancient. This hex will now be called the Third Hex of the Mountains and Seas!”</p>
 <p>As Meng Hao’s words echoed out, rumbling filled the starry sky. Numerous magical symbols appeared, which formed together into the underlying structure of the Third Mountain and Sea. Then the surrounding rubble was sucked in, converging together until the Third Mountain and Sea was visible for all the cultivators to see.</p>
 <p>The Third Sea’s water churned, sending massive waves back and forth!</p>
 <p>The Third Mountain rose high into the starry sky, towering and extraordinary!</p>
 <p>The Third Hex was the Present-Ancient Hex. Before Meng Hao created the Ninth Hex, it had been considered the most domineering of the Hexes, having been created by the Third Generation Demon Sealer, the most powerful of the Demon Sealers. It could control the flow of time, and now it formed the bones of the newly remoulded Third Mountain and Sea. Simply put, in terms of battle prowess, this Mountain and Sea would be extraordinary compared to the others.</p>
 <p>The power of Time flowed about to and fro. Similar to the First and Second Mountains and Seas, the cultivators of the Third Mountain and Sea would have special advantages in their practice of cultivation. They would have incredible, unheard-of control over the Essence of time.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the nature of time in the entire Mountain and Sea Realm would be under the control of the Third Mountain and Sea.</p>
 <p>The Mountain and Sea cultivators were prostrating in worship, and even the army of cultivators from the Vast Expanse School were shaking. The Sect Leader and the others, even the old lizard and the other eccentric beings, were all mentally shaken. Although they knew that Transcendent cultivators were all-powerful, to see the evidence in front of their own eyes was mind-blowing.</p>
 <p>The deep envy they felt after seeing the First through Third Mountains and Seas helped them to understand the significance of a precious treasure being designed uniquely for its own people. By this point, even they wanted to live in the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>“If you lived there, it would be much easier to reach the Dao Realm, and maybe even the peak of 9-Essences. In fact... it might even be possible to Transcend!”</p>
 <p>“It’s a Transcendence Treasure. Anyone who Transcends will build... a Transcendence Treasure suitable for their people!”</p>
 <p>The cultivators from the Vast Expanse School felt their minds spinning. As for Meng Hao, he looked at the three sets of Mountains and Seas that he had just formed, then took a deep breath and performed an incantation gesture with his right hand. He waved his finger, and the power of Transcendence erupted out, causing all the Heavens to shake.</p>
 <p>“Fourth Mountain and Sea!</p>
 <p>“I call upon the power of my name to take the Fourth Hex, the Self Hex, and embody it in the Fourth Mountain and Sea. Henceforth... you are the Self Mountain and Sea, responsible for the underworld and reincarnation within the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>“Cultivators in this Mountain and Sea may cultivate my Self Hex, and gain enlightenment of the Essence of self. This hex will now be called the Fourth Hex of the Mountains and Seas!”</p>
 <p>The starry sky shook under the terrifying might of Meng Hao’s Fourth Hex, the Self Hex. The Self Hex could spawn millions upon millions of the self, making it the perfect complement to reincarnation. When you added in the fact that the Fourth Mountain and Sea had always been the underworld of the Mountain and Sea Realm, where reincarnation resided, it ensured that this version of the underworld was even more shocking than before. It was truly the final destination for all cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>Whoever was the Lord of the Fourth Mountain and Sea would control all the dead spirits in the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>Each and every one of these four Mountains and Seas were crucial. It was at this point that Meng Hao, without the slightest hesitation, spoke out once more.</p>
 <p>“Fifth Mountain and Sea!” he said, his voice echoing like thunder. He waved his sleeve, and the outline of the Fifth Mountain and Sea instantly took shape, causing rumbling sounds to echo out in all directions.</p>
 <p>“I call upon the power of my name to take the Fifth Hex, the Inside-Outside Hex, and embody it in the Fifth Mountain and Sea. Henceforth... you are the Inside-Outside Mountain and Sea, responsible for the five elements within the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>“Cultivators in this Mountain and Sea may cultivate my Inside-Outside Hex, and gain enlightenment of the Essences of inside and outside. This hex will now be called the Fifth Hex of the Mountains and Seas!”</p>
 <p>Instantly, the Hexing magic formed the bones, represented by the countless magical symbols which were converging together. As the outline took shape, the rubble from the destroyed Mountains and Seas converged, and the Fifth Mountain and Sea took shape in front of everyone to hover there in the starry sky.</p>
 <p>The Fifth Mountain and Sea relied on the five elements as the foundation of its magic. The five elements were crucial aspects to the practice of cultivation, and from this moment on, all cultivators from the Fifth Mountain and Sea would have extraordinary command of the Dao of the five elements. Whoever was the Lord of the Fifth Mountain and Sea would control the fundamental aspects of the five elements throughout the entire Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>“When the five elements appear, Heaven and Earth are opened!” Meng Hao’s eyes shone with bright light as he reached out and made some final adjustments to the Fifth Mountain and Sea.</p>
 <p>The Fifth Mountain and Sea was the axis of the Mountain and Sea Realm, and the five elements there were absolutely critical. No mistakes could be tolerated.</p>
 <p>In order to be the Lord of any of the Mountains and Seas, not only did one need the approval of the Mountain and Sea Realm itself, one also needed to gain complete enlightenment of the Demon Sealing Hexing magic left behind by Meng Hao!</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Hexing magic was hidden within the various Mountains and Seas, like their bones!</p>
 <p>Only by gaining enlightenment of that Demon Sealing Hexing magic could one eventually qualify to be a Mountain and Sea Lord. Only by that method could one become a successor of the Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>It was now possible to say that the Mountain and Sea Realm had Hexing magic as its bones, the Mountains and Seas as its flesh, and... the League of Demon Sealers as its soul!</p>
