 <p></p>
 <p>Within the Qi vortex, Meng Hao’s body radiated Blood-Violet light. The light spread out of the vortex and then began to congeal together. Soon, a vague outline became visible.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The shape of the outline swirled continuously. The Violet Sea surged around Meng Hao, also turning into a vortex, which grew larger and larger until the entire Western Desert Violet Sea was affected! Roaring filled the air!</p>
 <p>All of the Cultivators who happened to be on the Violet Sea, regardless of where they were, were instantly filled with astonishment. In their shock, they had no way to even guess what was causing this phenomenon.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes were closed at the moment. The Blood-Violet light continued to radiate out intensely. The interlocking beams of light that were forming the outline, began to grow more and more clear. Soon it was obvious that the outline….</p>
 <p>Astonishingly, it was congealing into the shape of a small person.</p>
 <p>This person looked exactly like Meng Hao, only much, much smaller. It was about seven inches tall, its body completely transparent and emanating a Blood-Violet glow! An incredible aura was also detectable!</p>
 <p>The intensity of this aura far exceeded that possessed by virtually any other Nascent Soul Cultivator. It was even comparable to the Flawless Nascent Souls of Cultivators from great Sects!</p>
 <p>Upon its appearance, the Nascent Soul’s expression was one of confusion. However, it quickly came to its senses and stretched out its arms and legs. Meng Hao’s heart began to pound as the power of an early Nascent Soul Cultivation base suddenly exploded out within him!!</p>
 <p>Back at Blackgate Fort, he had temporarily possessed a similar, but unstable, Cultivation base. This time, it was permanent, and completely of his own!</p>
 <p>Furthermore, although this was still the early Nascent Soul stage, in terms of aura, the power was even more intense!</p>
 <p>This was a Blood-Violet Nascent Soul!!</p>
 <p>As soon as the Nascent Soul appeared, it flew out from Meng Hao’s body to float in the air in front of him. Its eyes glittered as it sat cross-legged in mid-air, its body radiating Blood-Violet light up into the sky.</p>
 <p>When looking at the Cultivation world of South Heaven as a whole, all Nascent Soul Cultivators generally cultivated a single Nascent Soul. That single Nascent Soul would become the focus of their path of cultivation.</p>
 <p>Only a few almighty practitioners possessed special techniques or incredible Cultivation bases that made a single Nascent Soul insufficient, and would therefore refine a second Nascent Soul.</p>
 <p>People like that were the strongest among the strong. Each and every one of them were people who left indelible marks on the pages of history.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, Meng Hao was taking his first steps down just such a path!</p>
 <p>The appearance of his Blood-Violet Nascent Soul caused a red glow to suddenly appear in Meng Hao’s eyes. He took a deep breath, then closed his eyes. By now, his Perfect Gold Core was completely shattered and had turned into a vortex that spun constantly and emanated a primordial aura.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Meng Hao’s Metal-type totem tattoo began to flicker and then slowly fade away. It sunk down into his body, transforming into a golden light which then fused into the primordial vortex.</p>
 <p>“Metal-type power from the spirit of the Golden Crow, an unbreakable metal,” murmured Meng Hao, “Using my pill concocting methods, I will use this to concoct Meng Hao’s… second Nascent Soul!” Using his body as the pill furnace and his heart as the pill formula, he once again began to concoct a Nascent Soul.</p>
 <p>Moments later, a rumbling sound emanated out from his body. Thankfully, Meng Hao was at the bottom of a sea. Were he not, the sound would have echoed out far into the distance. Despite being on the seafloor, it still caused huge waves to suddenly explode out in all directions.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the primordial vortex within Meng Hao emanated an intense golden light, which radiated out through his skin, making him look like a statue of gold.</p>
 <p>Next, an outline became visible within that golden light. It grew clearer and clearer as it transformed into a small person that looked exactly like the Blood-Violet Nascent Soul!</p>
 <p>It was seven inches tall, completely transparent, and had a blank expression on its face. It looked exactly like the Blood-Violet Nascent Soul, except that this second Nascent Soul emanated a golden glow!</p>
 <p>Its bearing was one of righteousness and utter holiness. After the space of a few breaths, the tiny golden figure’s eyes suddenly flashed with clearness. It stretched its body, causing golden light to explode out along with incredible power. Meng Hao’s Cultivation base suddenly exploded with power.</p>
 <p>It shot upward, climbing up to the peak of the early Nascent Soul stage, just a tiny step away from the mid Nascent Soul stage!</p>
 <p>The tiny golden figure was the second of Meng Hao’s Nascent Souls, a five elements Metal Nascent Soul!</p>
 <p>The Nascent Soul flickered as it shot out from within Meng Hao. It flew out just like the Blood-Violet Nascent Soul, except in a different direction, where it then stopped and then faced the first Nascent Soul.</p>
 <p>An incredible aura rippled out in all directions. Meng Hao’s Cultivation base undulated with incredible intensity. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath as the Wood-type totem tattoo on his forehead began to fade away.</p>
 <p>“Metal and Water have been concocted into Nascent Souls,” he murmured to himself. “Now it’s time for Wood…. The Greenwood Tree from the Ninth Sea will become my third Nascent Soul…. Wood Nascent Soul! With this Nascent Soul, my progress down the path of the Five-Colored Nascent Soul will be almost complete!” Meng Hao focused all of his mind and heart on the Qi vortex inside of him. Using his Spiritual Sense like his own hands, he again began to concoct a Nascent Soul.</p>
 <p>It only took moments before the primordial Qi vortex within him to begin to shine with a green light!</p>
 <p>It seemed as if lightning were dancing about within it. Incredible roaring sounds emanated out that seemed to contain life itself within them. It became life force, an overwhelming life force that seemed to stem from the beginning of all creation. At the same time… a beam of green light shot out from within the primordial vortex.</p>
 <p>The beam of light swirled around to form an outline of four limbs and a head. Facial features emerged. The eyes suddenly snapped open and began to shine with a blinding green light!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s Wood Nascent Soul suddenly appeared!</p>
 <p>The moment that the Wood Nascent Soul appeared, Meng Hao’s Cultivation base shot up, breaking out from the early Nascent Soul Stage and entering fully into the mid Nascent Soul stage!</p>
 <p>Three Nascent Souls. If any outsider could look upon this scene, that person would definitely be flabbergasted, filled with incredible disbelief. From ancient times until now, Cultivators who possessed three Nascent Souls were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. Perhaps only ten people had ever done so, and that was ten thousand years in the past.</p>
 <p>Right now, Meng Hao had successfully concocted a third Nascent Soul. However… in terms of the path of concocting a Five-Colored Nascent Soul, the first step wasn’t even fully complete! From this, it could be seen that Meng Hao’s Nascent Soul concocting method was truly something completely new!</p>
 <p>All of this, with the exception of Meng Hao’s acquisition of the various five elements totem tattoos, was almost completely because of his position as a Grandmaster of the Dao of Alchemy. Only with such an identity could he be qualified to use pill concocting techniques to concoct a Nascent Soul!</p>
 <p>Most importantly… was Meng Hao’s overall base. He had reached the great circle of Qi Condensation. He had ten Perfect Dao Pillars. He had completed the great circle of the Perfect Gold Core. With a base like that, he was completely unique in all the lands of South Heaven.</p>
 <p>Such a base was the reason that a primordial vortex spun about inside of him. It sustained him as he concocted one Nascent soul after another. Were anyone else in this situation, without such a foundation, they would be completely incapable of doing this.</p>
 <p>He was now about to enter a place that throughout the history of the great lands of South Heaven, only a few Nascent Soul experts had ever entered. Throughout countless years and among endless Chosen and heroes, this was the most Nascent Souls anyone had ever possessed. Four Nascent Souls.</p>
 <p>Throughout innumerable years, only three people had ever possessed four Nascent Souls!</p>
 <p>As of now, that number would be increased to four!</p>
 <p>“East Pill Everburning Flame,” murmured Meng Hao, “which is just like the eternity of my Dao of alchemy and my everburning heart. I will congeal the fire of the five elements of Heaven and Earth. This fire represents my Dao of alchemy, and the determination with which I practice cultivation!</p>
 <p>“This fire will be used to concoct my fourth Nascent Soul. Fire Nascent Soul!” His voice was soft, but filled with unhesitating decisiveness that could chop nails and sever iron. At the same time as he had spoken, the Wood Nascent Soul flew out to sit cross-legged in the air with the Water and Metal Nascent Souls. Three Nascent Souls circled through the air around Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a yellow light began to shine out from Meng Hao’s Fire-type totem tattoo as it slowly vanished. It also merged into the primordial vortex.</p>
 <p>A sea of fire appeared within Meng Hao, completely enveloping the primordial vortex. It spread out from within him to fill the entire area.</p>
 <p>He was completely surrounded by a sea of fire. Within the flames, the Qi vortex spun as a band of fire shot out. It quickly transformed into a small person, seven inches tall. This was Meng Hao’s five elements Fire Nascent Soul.</p>
 <p>As soon as it appeared, the flames in the area fell in on themselves, rippling back into Meng Hao and congealing onto the body of the Fire Nascent Soul. It was at this point that the Nascent Soul’s eyes opened.</p>
 <p>When that happened, Meng Hao’s Cultivation base exploded upward, climbing all the way to the peak of the mid Nascent Soul stage.</p>
 <p>Back at Blackgate Fort, when he first combined the five elements, his Cultivation base had climbed up to the peak of the mid Nascent Soul stage. Now, with only four Nascent Souls, he had already reached the same level he had before when combining the five elements.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao took a deep breath. His eyes glittered as the Fire Nascent Soul flew out to join the other three Nascent Souls that floated around his head. They were now formed into a four-sided spell formation.</p>
 <p>The exact center of that spell formation was none other than Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“The essence of the power of the Frost Soil Demon Emperor was the Frost soil, which existed even before primordial times, at the beginning of everything. That essence… will form my fifth Nascent Soul. Earth Nascent Soul!” He took a deep breath. Filled with unprecedented confidence, he closed his eyes once more. His final totem tattoo vanished and then merged into the Qi vortex within him.</p>
 <p>Time passed. Moments later, an intensely cold aura began to emanate out from Meng Hao to fill the area. Cracking sounds could be heard as the Violet Sea around him was frozen!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s Cultivation base exploded up again. Now, he was no longer at the peak of the mid Nascent Soul stage, but rather, had broken through into… the late Nascent Soul stage.</p>
 <p>His hair whipped about and his clothing rippled. At the same time, a intense howling sound could be heard coming from within him. A seven-inch-tall person floated up out of the top of his head. Its expression was one of solemnity, and it radiated a frigid aura, just like that of Frost soil.</p>
 <p>This was… Meng Hao’s five elements Earth Nascent Soul!!</p>
 <p>The five elements Earth Nascent Soul floated out. As of now, Meng Hao was surrounded by five Nascent Souls. Metal. Wood. Water. Fire. Earth. His five elements Nascent Souls were finally complete!</p>
 <p>The first step of the Five-Colored Nascent Soul was now finished.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, Meng Hao had reached an unprecedented point along the path of the Nascent Soul stage in the lands of South Heaven.</p>
 <p>There was no one more powerful than him!</p>
