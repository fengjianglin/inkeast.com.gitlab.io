 <p><strong>Chapter 1330: Dao Lord Fleshly Body!</strong></p>
 <p>“I can still get stronger!” Meng Hao suppressed the energy of qi and blood building up inside of him, not permitting it to fuse with his fleshly body. Instead, he looked off into the distance, his eyes gleaming with a bright light.</p>
 <p>As he shook his body out to limber it up, cracking sounds echoed out. A terrifying fleshly body power emanated out from him, and Meng Hao could sense that he was already several times stronger than before.</p>
 <p>Ignoring the surviving Outsiders in the area, he once again leapt up into the air. The ground beneath him shattered, swallowing up the Outsiders like a giant mouth. Miserable screams echoed out, but then vanished almost immediately. In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao sped through the air toward the location of the third star.</p>
 <p>This place was a tall mountain, and as soon as Meng Hao landed there, it shattered and collapsed. A huge crater opened up below, and a drop of golden blood flew up. Meng Hao grabbed it and, without pausing for a moment, absorbed it and then shot toward the fourth star!</p>
 <p>He appeared a moment later in the fourth area, where a swamp stretched out in all directions. As soon as he appeared, he slapped his hand down toward the swamp.</p>
 <p>The swamp was instantly destroyed, and the God blood concealed deep down below was extracted, shooting into Meng Hao’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao threw his head back and roared, and rumbling sounds could be heard as he grew even taller, instantly reaching 600 meters. His fleshly body now radiated incredible power; he could tell that he was now at the level of a Dao Lord!</p>
 <p>“Dao Lord fleshly body!” Meng Hao licked his lips. The good fortune he was acquiring here was incredible; it was power that could rend the Heavens and crush the Earth! It was as if he were being completely reborn! To him, the Vale of the Godgrave was a place to completely reach a higher level!</p>
 <p>He took a deep breath, which caused wind and thunder to scream, and everything to darken. With that, he stamped his foot down, and as the land was destroyed, he suddenly appeared at the location of the fifth star.</p>
 <p>There were also Outsiders here, and they seemed prepared to face a powerful enemy. Their cultivation bases exploded with power, sending the entire area into chaos, exerting incredible pressure with a wide array of magical techniques and divine abilities. Numerous shocking shields surrounded a wizened 5-Essences Outsider, who was sitting there cross-legged, absorbing vast quantities of qi and blood. As he did so, his gaunt frame radiated an increasingly terrifying power.</p>
 <p>Even as Meng Hao closed in, rumbling sounds could be heard as the Outsider’s fleshly body suddenly broke through to the Dao Realm!!</p>
 <p>Only the best of the best among the Outsiders had been sent into this place to acquire the good fortune of God blood, to increase their fleshly bodies to incredible levels.</p>
 <p>The Outsider experienced the fleshly body breakthrough at almost the same moment that Meng Hao arrived. When Meng Hao landed, the ground shattered, blasting away in layers as a boundlessly domineering air spread out. All of the Outsiders’ divine abilities and magical techniques were shattered as a massive windstorm kicked up. Miserable screams rang out as the vast majority of the Outsiders, unable to stand up to the power, were killed.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao turned and reached a claw-like hand out toward the wizened Outsider. However, in that same moment, the Outsider opened his eyes, which shone with brilliant light. He shot backwards, simultaneously unleashing a fist strike to meet Meng Hao’s palm.</p>
 <p>A boom rang out. Meng Hao’s expression was the same as ever, but the Outsider coughed up a mouthful of blood, and a shocked expression appeared on his face. He immediately began to retreat at top speed.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered coldly as he looked at the fleeing Outsider. Having sensed the level of his opponent's fleshly body, he chuckled coldly, then unleashed his own fist strike!</p>
 <p>The Life-Extermination Fist!</p>
 <p>This version of the Life-Extermination Fist was completely different than the one he had been able to unleash before. Instantly, all of the life force in the surrounding 30,000-meter area was sucked away.</p>
 <p>A 30,000-meter area became a field of death!</p>
 <p>The Outsider let out a wretched shriek, and attempted to fight back. However, his life force was inexorably sucked away. Soon, the entire area had absolutely no life force in it, almost as if the natural laws in the area had been changed, as if... life was incompatible with this area!</p>
 <p>All of the pressure of this field of death weighed down onto the Outsider; rumbling sounds could be heard as he let out a bloodcurdling scream, and then exploded!</p>
 <p>As he exploded, his qi and blood dissipated. However, the bits of God blood within him shot toward Meng Hao, boring into him as if he were the lodestone of all God blood.</p>
 <p>Rumbling echoed out from inside of him as he grew even taller, and the power of his fleshly body increased until it was very close to the 4-Essences level. Then he flickered, shooting like lightning toward the location of the sixth star.</p>
 <p>As Meng Hao sped along, this part of the Vale of the Godgrave began to collapse, as if he were taking away whatever power it was that supported the head, as if the existence of this part of the dimension was now completely meaningless.</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as the collapse spread. By that time, Meng Hao was at the location of the sixth star.</p>
 <p>Here could be seen another huge lake, except that instead of water, it was filled with lightning!</p>
 <p>As Meng Hao neared, the power of that lightning exploded out, converging together and surging toward him as if to overwhelm him.</p>
 <p>“Eee…?” Meng Hao said. Eyes flashing, he looked at the lake of lighting, and did nothing to avoid it. Instead, he plunged into the middle of it all. Rumbling could be heard as the lightning slammed into him. He shook his arms and legs, and the lightning collapsed.</p>
 <p>However, it seemed endless, slamming into him relentlessly, over and over again. Meng Hao snorted coldly, then clenched his right hand into a fist and unleashed a fist strike onto the ground directly beneath the lake of lightning.</p>
 <p>It was not the Life-Extermination fist, it was the Bedevilment Fist!</p>
 <p>The Bedevilment Fist had been unleashed onto the land!</p>
 <p>The ground trembled, and crevices spread out. Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with a red glow, and his cultivation base rotated madly. Combined with the power of his fleshly body, it put his energy... at something past what Lord White had been. In fact, it was no weaker than Ksitigarbha. This was the power of... a 6-Essences Dao Sovereign!</p>
 <p>Rumbling rose up, and the ground collapsed. A gigantic crater appeared that was far larger than any of the previous craters, and the lake of lighting was completely swallowed up!</p>
 <p>Since the troublesome lake of lightning was attempting to block his progress just like the land was, Meng Hao decided to wipe them both away simultaneously!</p>
 <p>The lake of lightning faded away, and Meng Hao lifted his right hand, causing a golden drop of blood to rise up from the lands below, which he grabbed.</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as he touched the golden blood, a roar of rage suddenly seemed to echo out from down below.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered. Even as the roar echoed out, he pushed the golden blood into his forehead. A tremor ran through him, and the signs of an imminent breakthrough once again erupted out.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as Meng Hao grew to a size of, not 600 meters, but 1,200 meters. He threw his head back and roared, causing all light to dim. Ignoring the roar of rage directed against him, he shot toward the area with the seventh star.</p>
 <p>That location was covered by a dense forest, much of which had already been felled by the more than 10,000 Outsiders in the area. Moments ago, all of them had been in the midst of kowtowing in the direction of a huge crater, in the middle of which was an aged Outsider with dull scales. He sat there cross-legged, constantly absorbing the blood-colored qi from the ground.</p>
 <p>As of this point, his relentless absorption seemed to have drained the area of at least ninety percent of the qi there.</p>
 <p>In the same moment that Meng Hao destroyed the lake of lightning, this Outsider Patriarch’s eyes snapped open, and they radiated with ancient and boundless cruelty. Suddenly, he said, “Sacrifice!”</p>
 <p>As the words left his mouth, the surrounding Outsiders unhesitatingly... unleashed their cultivation bases in order to self-detonate!</p>
 <p>The self-detonation of over 10,000 Outsiders created a towering force, which then transformed into a blinding light that obliterated everything in a 5,000 meter radius. At the same time, much of that power was absorbed by the Outsider Patriarch by means of some unknown technique.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao arrived in almost the exact moment that all the Outsiders self-detonated. The blast itself would have seriously injured him were it not for the fact that his fleshly body had just experienced a breakthrough into the 5-Essences level.</p>
 <p>Even as Meng Hao closed in, a figure shot up from within the blast of the self-detonations, slamming a fist into Meng Hao’s chest.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao lurched to a stop, a strange glow in his eyes. However, he didn't retreat, but instead advanced, slamming forward in an attack. A muffled grunt rang out from the mouth of the shadowy figure who had just attacked him, and Meng Hao laughed coldly as he went in for another attack.</p>
 <p>Massive crashing booms rang out as the two of them exchanged hundreds of blows. Soon, the shadows which cloaked the figure began to slip away, revealing the Outsider Patriarch.</p>
 <p>By this point, however, he didn't seem as old as he had before. He had more life force, and his fleshly body power, which was at the Dao Lord level, when combined with this 5-Essences cultivation base, made him similar to a Dao Sovereign!</p>
 <p>“No wonder you chose the Seventh Mountain and Sea.... Lord White turned traitor, plus you planned to use this place... to produce three experts on the level of a Dao Sovereign.” Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with the realization that, if he hadn’t come here for the same purpose as these Outsiders, and arrived just in the nick of time, then they would have succeeded in their efforts, which would have been a catastrophe for the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>The Outsider Patriarch’s eyes flickered with killing intent, and yet inwardly, he was afraid, and backed up. He knew that he was not a match for Meng Hao, and therefore, since he couldn’t get any more God blood from this area, he decided that he might as well just leave.</p>
 <p>Even as he began to back away, killing intent flared within Meng Hao’s eyes, and he flickered into motion towards the old Outsider.</p>
 <p>The Outsider Patriarch laughed derisively as he raised his right hand up into the air and made a ripping motion, causing a huge rift to be torn open in the sky. “If I feel like leaving, nobody but a Paragon can stop me!”</p>
 <p>Instantly, he shot toward that exit rift at top speed.</p>
 <p>At the exact same time, a power of emptiness suddenly erupted out from him. It was none other than Essence power!</p>
 <p>“Essence of emptiness!” the old Outsider said slowly. “Heaven and Earth are not real. Nothing under a Paragon can stop my teleportation magic.” With that, he began to fade away into the rift.</p>
 <p>A moment later, Meng Hao’s attack reached him, and it passed directly through him.</p>
 <p>“Well, isn’t this interesting,” Meng Hao said, eyes flickering. He attacked again, but this time he performed an incantation gesture and then pointed up toward the Heavens.</p>
 <p>“Demon Sealing Hexing magic, hex this dimension! Eighth Hex!</p>
 <p>“Seventh Hex!</p>
 <p>“Sixth Hex!</p>
 <p>“Fifth Hex!</p>
 <p>“Third Hex!</p>
 <p>“Second Hex!</p>
 <p>“Let’s see how you get away now!” The entire dimension was shaking in response to the wave of Meng Hao’s finger. It was at this point that the Outsider Patriarch’s face completely fell.</p>
