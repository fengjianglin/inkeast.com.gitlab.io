 <p><strong>Chapter 1296: THAT Spear!</strong></p>
 <p>“Is that the Mountain and Sea Lord, Heavengod?”</p>
 <p>“That’s definitely him. Only Heavengod would have the energy to sweep across the Eighth Mountain and Sea like that!” All of the cultivators from the Eighth Mountain and Sea were getting very excited.</p>
 <p>Moments before, the feeling of being suppressed by the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea had overwhelmed them, but now that feeling was gone. However, despite all of the excitement, the Chief Dharma Protector of the Heavengod Society, as well as the other Dao Lords in the Eighth Mountain and Sea, were all completely shaken. Looks of bewilderment could be seen on their faces as they looked out into the starry sky at the source of the ripples that everyone else assumed to be coming from their Mountain and Sea Lord.</p>
 <p>“That’s not... the exalted Heavengod....” thought the Chief Dharma Protector, his heart trembling. He could sense that Heavengod was currently on the Eighth Mountain, and was still slumbering. In fact, all of the other Dao Lords of the Eighth Mountain and Sea all had similar sensations.</p>
 <p>“If he’s not the exalted Heavengod, then... who is he...?” That was the question running through the minds of the Chief Dharma Protector and the other Dao Lords. Then they all began to tremble as they... a certain person popped into their heads.</p>
 <p>It was someone who had unleashed a shocking Daoist magic in battle recently, clearing the entire battlefield....</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao!” said the Chief Dharma Protector, gasping. As soon as the name left his mouth, his heart filled with mixed emotions. As of this moment, he was certain that the person emanating an energy similar to that of a Mountain and Sea Lord was none other than Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The cultivators of the Eighth Mountain and Sea were filled with excitement, but those from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were completely shocked. The huge disparity in their energy from moments ago was now gone, and very quickly the fighting resumed.</p>
 <p>However, the fighting that did go on was not very intense; no one seemed to be very interested in fighting at the moment, and the fact that the battlefield had calmed down gave everyone a chance to focus their attention on that location off in the distance... where a fight was about to begin that would determine the fate of two of the great Mountains and Seas!</p>
 <p>It was... a battle of Mountain and Sea Lords!</p>
 <p>If Lord White was defeated, then the tide of battle would completely turn in favor of the Eighth Mountain and Sea. If the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea was actually killed, then the cultivators from that Mountain and Sea would be decimated, and the Seventh Mountain and Sea would suffer an unrecoverable loss.</p>
 <p>However, if Lord White won, then the Eighth Mountain and Sea... would no longer exist.</p>
 <p>Everyone was waiting... to see how this battle would play out!</p>
 <p>RUMBLE!</p>
 <p>Outside of the rift, Meng Hao’s energy skyrocketed. The Paragon Bridge inside of him surged madly, and his cultivation base surged into rotation. His Soul Lamps flew out, his aura radiated out, and the power of his divine sense caused the starry sky to shake.</p>
 <p>And then, he took a step forward.</p>
 <p>That step was like the eruption of a volcano. Meng Hao’s energy solidified around him, forming something like an impregnable wall which then crushed out toward Lord White.</p>
 <p>Lord White stared at Meng Hao with a strange light gleaming in his eyes. His expression was not the least bit contemptuous, and in fact, he felt the situation to be a grave one. He could tell that Meng Hao was an incredible threat to him.</p>
 <p>Seeing that manifestation of Meng Hao’s energy speeding toward him, Lord White waved his hand, causing blinding white light to spill out, subsequently transforming into 1,000,000 sword projections, which proceeded to pierce out in all directions. Massive rumbling sounds echoed out as Meng Hao’s converged energy was stabbed through countless times, and then collapsed.</p>
 <p>In the middle of that collapse, Lord White strode forward, waving his finger toward Meng Hao, sending the 1,000,000 sword lights flowing toward him like a rumbling river.</p>
 <p>From a distance, it looked like a river of stars sweeping along with the power to destroy entire worlds!</p>
 <p>Shockingly, each beam of sword light contained terrifyingly destructive Dao Realm power that, when combined together, caused wild colors to flash in the starry sky.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao's pupils constricted, and yet, he didn’t back up. Instead, he took another step forward, clenching his hand into a fist and unleashing a punch.</p>
 <p>It was none other than the Life-Extermination Fist!</p>
 <p>The starlight shattered, and the sword beams distorted. Meng Hao’s punch created an enormous vortex which rumbled as it spun, destroying the sword lights. From a distance, it seemed that the flow of that starry river had suddenly been obstructed.</p>
 <p>However, things weren’t over yet. Meng Hao took a third step, unleashing the Bedevilment Fist.</p>
 <p>It was as if one willingly underwent bedevilment, a complete and eternal descent into madness. The Bedevilment Fist was backed by Meng Hao’s energy and determination, smashing into the remaining sword lights, causing intense rumbling to rise up as more than half of them were completely shattered.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes gleamed as he took a fourth step, and... the God-Slaying Fist made its appearance!</p>
 <p>The will of the God-Slaying Fist could merge with Heaven and Earth and fuse into the starry sky, converging the power of one’s fleshly body. A cultivators with an indestructible Allheaven cultivation base could thus destroy the Heavens, extinguish the Earth, as a God of Slaying!</p>
 <p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!</p>
 <p>The starry sky shuddered and began to be torn apart layer by layer. The remaining sword lights shuddered, and then were shoved backward toward Lord White as if by some mad wind.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with killing intent; without a moment’s hesitation, he took a fifth step, performing an incantation gesture with his right hand that caused the Blood Demon to appear and lunge toward Lord White with gaping maw.</p>
 <p>Lord White’s pupils constricted. Snorting coldly, he said, “Interesting. You deserve for me to take you a bit seriously.”</p>
 <p>Next, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, then pushed down onto his chest. In conjunction with the pressing down, icy coldness appeared all around him, along with an aura of Essence.</p>
 <p>However, this was not the Essence of ice, it was something else... something that could influence the power of Essence belonging to others. It was... emotionless extermination!</p>
 <p>The key to being emotionless was to extinguish the seven emotions and six pleasures, to make oneself as cold as ice, and transform that into a will of extermination. As the finger waved through the air, Meng Hao shuddered as all of his blood suddenly iced up. Lord White's finger seemed to press down onto Meng Hao’s soul, to wipe away all of his emotions!</p>
 <p>Family love, friendship, romantic love....</p>
 <p>In an instant, they seemed to be peeled away, separated from him, as if they were about to vanish. Meng Hao threw his head back and roared, causing a boundless light to shine off of him. The Paragon Bridge suddenly exploded out into the open, becoming a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering bridge that emanated an intense, archaic air.</p>
 <p>As soon as the bridge appeared, everything began to shake, and Lord White’s Essence of emotionless extermination suddenly grew still.</p>
 <p>In that brief moment, Meng Hao’s eyes glittered with coldness, and he shuddered. His starstone melted, and he transformed into a meteor, the manifestation of none other than the One Thought Stellar Transformation. Instantly, he swept out toward Lord White with incredible speed.</p>
 <p>He was... trying to clinch the victory right now!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, he was closing with an explosive power that caused Lord White’s brow to furrow. Then, Lord White extended his right hand and pushed out into the air.</p>
 <p>The power of his peak 5-Essences cultivation base converged into a huge palm that rumbled through the air toward the meteor and then grabbed down onto it!</p>
 <p>The clenching hand seemed like it could even crush a planet within its grasp, and cracking sounds could be heard as fissures spread out across the meteor’s surface. However, before it could get any closer to Lord White, when it was still over a hundred meters away, it suddenly exploded.</p>
 <p>In its place appeared an azure streak of light, moving with indescribable speed out from the rubble of the meteor. As it pierced through the enormous hand, it became clear that it was a huge azure roc!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao was almost directly in front of Lord White, baring claws that were sharp enough to slice metal and shatter rock. Even as he slashed out with his claws, the Mountain Consuming Incantation summoned numerous huge mountains which crushed down from above.</p>
 <p>That still wasn't enough, though. Shockingly, a long spear suddenly appeared next to Meng Hao in azure roc-form. That spear was the same spear that Greed had unsealed, with the World Tree haft and the dragon tip.</p>
 <p>That spear rumbled through the air directly toward Lord White’s forehead.</p>
 <p>All of this takes quite some time to describe, but actually took place in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. Normally speaking, considering the level of the cultivation bases involved, a fight between Meng Hao and Lord White could last for months or even years.</p>
 <p>After all, this level of fighting was rarely seen in the Mountain and Sea Realm, and there was even the likelihood that the entire Eighth Mountain could be destroyed in the process.</p>
 <p>However... assuming one party was willing to go all out, then the length of the fight could be shortened drastically. Right now, the person going all out was Meng Hao. The situation was one in which Lord White assumed that he wouldn’t do such a thing, wouldn’t risk his life so blithely, yet that was exactly what he did.</p>
 <p>Not even Lord White could have guessed that this would happen. He frowned, and killing intent slowly filled his eyes. However, there was no time to ponder the matter. He immediately waved his right hand, causing his five fingernails to shatter and form into five crescent moons, which radiated a shocking curse power as they shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the starry sky as Meng Hao’s Mountain Consuming Incantation collapsed. The Paragon Bridge began to shake, and his azure roc-form’s claws collapsed. Even as blood and gore spattered about, Meng Hao appeared and grabbed onto the spear. Then, the speed of the spear increased dramatically, and the tip stabbed toward Lord White’s forehead, until it was only about seven inches away!</p>
 <p>Lord White's eyes widened as an intense sensation of deadly crisis rose up within him. He opened his mouth and roared, a shocking sound which instantly caused a huge illusory projection to appear behind him, which was also roaring at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The power was like a tempest, causing all light to dim!</p>
 <p>The dragon on Meng Hao’s long spear roared, but compared to the giant, it was weak. Lord White’s roar caused the spear to begin to shatter, and within moments... it was nothing more than ash!</p>
 <p>“Too weak,” Lord White said coolly, although inwardly his heart was pounding with anxiety.</p>
 <p>It was in that instant that the spear in Meng Hao’s hand trembled.</p>
 <p>“Demon Weapon, Lonelytomb!” Meng Hao said.</p>
 <p>RUMBLE!</p>
 <p>The collapse of the spear revealed that there was actually... another spear hidden inside of it!!</p>
 <p>That spear was pitch black, and seemed to be congealed from numerous souls. It was... Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, a precious treasure that was unique to... the Demon Sealers!</p>
 <p>As soon as the spear appeared, Meng Hao’s energy surged, and the spear shot onward toward Lord White’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Everything so far had been connected. First was his explosive opening attack, then his near death, the collapse of the meteor, the destruction of the mountains, the dispersal of the dragon spear. Apparently... all of that had been building up to... this spear attack!</p>
 <p>Lord White’s face completely fell!</p>
