 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, countless cultivators and other living entities on the land masses settled down cross-legged and combined their divine sense into a massive wave. That wave then surged out like a tempest to batter against the embodiment of the will of Allheaven, with his eight arms and four heads.</p>
 <p>You use the life force of the entire starry sky of the Vast Expanse? Well I’ll use magic to reach into the past and use the power of my people to fight back!</p>
 <p>This was a magical technique that would exceed the comprehension of most cultivators. However, considering the realm Patriarch Vast Expanse was in, time and space could be molded into divine abilities and great Daos.</p>
 <p>The four-headed, eight-armed embodiment of the will of Allheaven stared with bright red eyes. Then he waved his arms, unleashing waves of crackling lightning to fight the windstorm.</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the air, and at the same time, thumping sounds emanated out from Meng Hao as his energy erupted, the result of the process of combining his Hexing magic!</p>
 <p>“First Hex!” He waved his sleeve, and the Beginning-Ending Hex appeared. That was the beginning of the series of Hexing magics, and also the ending piece in the puzzle that Meng Hao had assembled. He didn’t create it himself, of course, but rather, obtained it by means of the legacy of Shui Dongliu, who himself was created by a fragment of the will of Paragon Nine Seals.</p>
 <p>After absorbing it, it became Meng Hao’s First Hex!</p>
 <p>His eyes glittered as the Hex appeared, and at the same time, a point of light began to shine on his forehead. As soon as it did, the redness in the eyes of Allheaven’s embodiment grew even more intense.</p>
 <p>Then, Meng Hao’s eyes flashed as he performed an incantation gesture. He was unleashing the...</p>
 <p>“Second Hex!</p>
 <p>Real-Unreal Hexing. Finding the real in the unreal, taking the unreal and making it real. A second point of light appeared on Meng Hao’s forehead. At first glance it seemed like an illusion, but closer examination revealed that it was corporeal. It even seemed capable of absorbing minds!</p>
 <p>That was the Second Hex!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao took a deep breath. Thanks to the magic of Patriarch Vast Expanse’s clone, Meng Hao was actually standing within an ancient era, although things didn’t look very much different than they had before. The sky was blue, and the ground was covered with green limestone. The air was thick with spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>From a distance, rainbows could be seen stretching across the sky. As for Patriarch Vast Expanse’s clone, he was converging the divine sense of all of the cultivators of his lands and slamming it against the embodiment of the will of Allheaven.</p>
 <p>“Third Hex!” Meng Hao’s hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture, and rumbling sounds filled Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>The Third Hex was Present-Ancient Hexing, and as soon is it appeared, it instantly harmonized with the current state of the world. A resonance formed, which made sense considering that Meng Hao was surrounded by ancient times, where he himself was from the present. Present and ancient existed simultaneously, causing the power of time to spread out along with the appearance of the Present-Ancient Hex. At the same time, a third point of light appeared on Meng Hao’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Three points of light glittered radiantly, and Meng Hao’s energy continued to rise. Without pausing for a moment, he waved both of his hands out in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Fourth Hex!”</p>
 <p>The Fourth Hex was among the most powerful of the first eight Hexes. It was called the Self Hex, and could create seemingly infinite clones, enough to fill an entire world. As soon as it appeared, Meng Hao was immediately surrounded by countless different versions of himself.</p>
 <p>One of those figures caused Meng Hao’s mind to reel the instant he caught sight of him. It was Little Treasure....</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, now was not the time to ponder the matter. Meng Hao immediately glanced away and prepared to perform an incantation gesture to unleash the Fifth Hex. However, it was in that very moment that a massive force surged against him. He shook visibly, and blood sprayed out of his mouth as he was shoved backward.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Patriarch Vast Expanse’s clone exploded. Just as he was about to reform, the four-headed, eight-armed embodiment of the will of Allheaven waved a sleeve, which instantly slowed down the process. The embodiment of Allheaven was riddled with so many wounds that he looked like a mass of flesh and blood, and yet he instantly charged toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as he moved, the divine sense of the countless living beings on the land mass forged a barrier, yet again making it impossible for the embodiment to reach Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Screw off!” he roared, waving his numerous arms, unleashing massive force against the barrier, which subsequently began to collapse, layer by layer.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes were crimson as he backed up, yet again performing an incantation gesture.</p>
 <p>“Fifth Hex!”</p>
 <p>The Fifth Hex was the Inside-Outside Hex. As soon as it appeared, a force of expulsion erupted out, creating a black hole in front of Meng Hao. That black hole spun rapidly, shrinking down until it became the fifth point light on Meng Hao’s forehead.</p>
 <p>By that point, the embodiment of Allheaven had almost completely broken through the barrier. The countless streams of divine sense were in the midst of collapse.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao continued to back up.</p>
 <p>“Sixth Hex!”</p>
 <p>Life-Death Hexing!</p>
 <p>“Seventh Hex!”</p>
 <p>Karmic Hexing!</p>
 <p>“Eighth Hex!”</p>
 <p>Body-Mind Hexing!</p>
 <p>When those three Hexing magics emerged from Meng Hao’s hands, brightly colored light flashed in Heaven and Earth, and massive winds screamed. Everything shook violently. It was also in that exact same moment that the embodiment of Allheaven blasted away all of the divine sense of the living beings in the world. Then, he shot forward to appear directly in front of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>As he reached his hand out to wipe Meng Hao out of existence, the pressure radiating off of him caused Meng Hao’s mind to reel. However, even as the pressure crushed down on him, Meng Hao’s eyes glittered brightly, and he unleashed his Ninth Hex!</p>
 <p>“Ninth Hex!”</p>
 <p>Seal the Heavens Hex!</p>
 <p>A mighty power descended, something boundlessly domineering. It was a power that said, If I want your eyes opened, they shall NOT be closed. If I want them closed, they had BETTER not be open!</p>
 <p>What I want, the Heavens shall NOT lack! What I don’t want, had BETTER not exist in the Heavens!</p>
 <p>“BEGONE!” Meng Hao roared. A power that did not come from the starry sky of Allheaven erupted from the Ninth Hex, something like a mad wind that blasted into the embodiment of the will of Allheaven.</p>
 <p>The world shook as that power became an attack force. Meng Hao was shoved backward, as was the embodiment of Allheaven, whose expression was that of terror. However, his eyes were also filled with intense killing intent. He forced himself to grind to a halt, holding nothing back as he fought against the power. His body trembled violently, and suddenly, two of his heads exploded, as well as several of his arms. And yet, he gritted his teeth and took a step forward.</p>
 <p>However, it was at this point that the clone of Patriarch Vast Expanse, whom Allheaven’s will had destroyed moments ago, formed back together. He instantly teleported directly in front of the embodiment of Allheaven, whereupon flames erupted from him, along with a terrifying aura.</p>
 <p>He waved his right hand, yet again blocking the path of the severely damaged embodiment.</p>
 <p>Allheaven’s embodiment roared, then transformed into countless motes of light. As they spread out, they flew up into the sky to transform into a gigantic finger!</p>
 <p>The boundless, majestic finger stretched down from the starry sky, rumbling down toward Meng Hao and the clone of Patriarch Vast Expanse.</p>
 <p>As it descended, countless black flowers appeared on its surface. As they bloomed, vicious creatures flew out, all of them with three heads and six arms. Their energy surged as they charged in attack.</p>
 <p>By this point, Meng Hao’s Ninth Hex was fully deployed. A ninth point of light appeared on his forehead, whereupon all of the other lights merged together with it to create something that looked like a sun.</p>
 <p>Nine Hexes, combined!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao threw his head back and roared. Rumbling sounds echoed out, along with the aura of Transcendence. The starry sky shook, and the universe trembled. After the nine Hexes combined, they all transformed into Essences, causing Meng Hao’s cultivation base to truly... reach the 9-Essences level!</p>
 <p>After that, his cultivation base power skyrocketed, growing intensely powerful, breaking through all barriers. Wind screamed around him as the finger formed from the will of Allheaven began to shake.</p>
 <p>But, things weren’t over yet. Meng Hao’s eyes were bright red as he looked up and roared, “Converge nine Essences, cultivation base breakthrough!!”</p>
 <p>BOOOOOOOOOMMM! His nine Essences converged together. Nine became one... and the door of Heaven and Earth opened; the limitations of the Vast Expanse were destroyed. A clap of thunder rang out, which could be heard by all lives and in all worlds throughout the starry sky of Allheaven.</p>
 <p>Within that thunderclap was Meng Hao’s voice, which echoed out through all of the Vast Expanse.</p>
 <p>“I am Meng Hao. Here I Transcend!”</p>
