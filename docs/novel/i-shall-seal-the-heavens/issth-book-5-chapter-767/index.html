 <p><strong>Chapter 767: The Northern Reaches Invades!</strong></p>
 <p>“Northern Reaches!” thought Meng Hao, his pupils constricting.</p>
 <p>Currently, the other peak Dao Seeking experts were unable to see what Meng Hao was seeing. Except for… Pill Demon. His eyes began to shine with golden light, and his face fell.</p>
 <p>The cheers were still echoing out through the air as all the cultivators down below awaited Pill Demon’s words of officiation, and the final moments of the wedding ceremony.</p>
 <p>However, Meng Hao and Pill Demon’s hearts froze up and, as of this moment, were sinking to the lowest depths!</p>
 <p>From the expression on Meng Hao’s face, Xu Qing could immediately sense that something was wrong. “What’s wrong…?” she asked, nervously gripping his hand.</p>
 <p>“The Northern Reaches… are invading us,” he said quietly, clasping her hand tightly.</p>
 <p>Although none of the cultivators below could hear what he said, the nearby peak Dao Seeking Patriarchs’ faces suddenly fell.</p>
 <p>“That’s….” Pill Demon’s eyes went wide as he looked at the enormous, shocking bridge that stretched out over the Milky Way Sea, as well as the enormous cauldron which drew nearer and nearer.</p>
 <p>Pill Demon’s face flickered. Worried that panic would ensue, he kept his voice low as he said, “Meng Hao, look closely. Do you see that stone cauldron with no decorations, filled with pitch-black soil? Is there… an incense stick… sticking out of the soil?!?!”</p>
 <p>Even as Pill Demon spoke, the cheering cultivators down below suddenly grew quiet. Expressions of confusion appeared on their faces, and soon, everyone began to realize that Pill Demon was looking at the Milky Way Sea.</p>
 <p>In response to Pill Demon’s question, Meng Hao blinked his eye nine more times. Instantly, his view of the Milky Way Sea zoomed in, and he confirmed that there was indeed an incense stick in the black soil that filled the enormous cauldron.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” he said, nodding his head.</p>
 <p>Pill Demon’s face went ashen, and his pupils constricted. He immediately flew up into the air, and called out in a loud voice: “Southern Domain cultivators, all of you must immediately unleash the power of your cultivation bases and interfere with the flow of spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth. Create a barrier immediately. HURRY!</p>
 <p>“Patriarch Song, apprentice alchemist and Meng Hao, come with me. Bring Patriarch Golden Frost and the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch!!</p>
 <p>“We must not under any circumstances… allow that stone cauldron to touch the lands of the Southern Domain!” roared Pill Demon as he shot toward the Milky Way Sea. “That is none other than Hellwither Nineruins Incense, refined from the flesh and blood of a true Immortal!! It is the most malicious of curses; if it even touches the land, the curse will spread out to all cultivators born in the Southern Domain! Their fleshly bodies will wither, and their cultivation bases will decline! There is no cure or antidote, and it is impossible to flee, not even by leaving the Southern Domain. Anyone born in the Southern Domain will be cursed!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Song’s face fell, and Sun Tao of the Violet Fate Sect had a similar reaction. Without hesitation, they followed along at top speed.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flashed with killing intent. Today was his grand wedding, the most important day in his life. Xu Qing had less than a hundred years of longevity, and all he wanted was to give her a magnificent wedding. Unfortunately, they had been interrupted halfway through.</p>
 <p>The arrival of the Northern Reaches cultivators was completely unforeseen. How could Meng Hao not be enraged?</p>
 <p>He looked at Xu Qing, and although her heart was filled with concern, the only thing that could be seen on her face was a gentle expression.</p>
 <p>“The wedding ceremony isn’t over yet,” she said softly. “I’ll be waiting here for you.”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao nodded, then flew up into the air. His second true self materialized next to him, and Patriarch Golden Frost and the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch emerged from within the Immortal’s palace. In the blink of an eye, they all transformed into beams of light that shot toward the Milky Way Sea.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Severing cultivators who had formed the dragon and phoenix immediately appeared. The power of their cultivation bases surged out, causing the air to distort. Down below, the hundreds of thousands of other cultivators, still reeling in shock because of the sudden developments, also unleashed the power of their cultivation bases. It only took a moment for the air to distort, and a violent windstorm to rise up.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Northern Reaches cultivators on the Resurrection Lily bridge over the Milky Way Sea realized that they had been discovered. With no further need to conceal their presence, rumbling filled the air, and the appearance of the Milky Way Sea instantly changed!</p>
 <p>It no longer looked sunny and calm. Instead, massive waves surged across its surface, as well as numerous corpses. Those corpses were none other than Milky Way Sea cultivators.</p>
 <p>Also fully visible was the ferocious-looking Resurrection Lily bridge, as well as the million Northern Reaches cultivators, stretching out in formation like a huge dragon.</p>
 <p>“Within a month, the Southern Domain will be destroyed!” a cold and ancient voice rang out. It was an old man within the Northern Reaches forces. He wore animal-hide clothing, and a necklace of bone teeth was strung around his neck. He flew up into the air, followed by three shocking figures.</p>
 <p>Of those three people, two were old men and one was a boy.</p>
 <p>The two old men looked exactly alike, except that one wore all black clothing and the other wore all white. Astonishingly, their cultivation bases were at the peak of Dao Seeking. As for the boy, he held a Cinnabar Fruit in his hand, which he would occasionally gnaw at. A red glow could be seen in his eyes, and he was surrounded by a thick, murderous air. He was also at the peak of Dao Seeking.</p>
 <p>These four people were the Patriarchs leading the first wave of the Northern Reaches army. A few days behind them was the second wave of hundreds of thousands of Northern Reaches cultivators.</p>
 <p>The first wave was so close that they could see the mountains of the Southern Domain, as well as the six bright beams of light that were shooting through the air.</p>
 <p>At the same time, they also noticed the shocking windstorm created by the cultivation bases of the hundreds of thousands of cultivators, which rose up into the sky, emitting shocking power.</p>
 <p>“These Southern Domain cultivators are clever. They actually sensed us ahead of time, and knew exactly when we would arrive.”</p>
 <p>“Not only did they know the time, they also knew the place, and are in combat readiness! They’ve even combined the cultivation bases of several hundred thousand cultivators into a windstorm! They hope to reduce the power of our sacred balm!”</p>
 <p>“From their reaction, it seems they actually know about our plan! Thankfully, we’re thoroughly prepared. It’s too bad the sacred balm is most effective when they are scattered!”</p>
 <p>“Of the six people approaching, four are at the peak of Dao Seeking. One is early Dao Seeking, and the third, the red-robed youth... it seems he’s only a Second Severing cultivator?”</p>
 <p>“Whatever, it doesn’t matter, we’ll stick to the plan and sacrifice our sacred balm!!”</p>
 <p>The four Northern Reaches Patriarchs exchanged glances, and then the old man with the bone-tooth necklace snorted coldly. He produced a red medicinal pill which was covered with bizarre magical symbols, which he immediately consumed. Then he stretched his hands out and lifted his head back to let out a wild roar.</p>
 <p>“Dragonfish Transformation!”</p>
 <p>At the same time, his body instantly began to expand and grow scales. In the blink of an eye, he was dozens of meters tall and bulging with muscles. Shockingly, the bone teeth around his neck shot out to swirl around him in a spherical spell formation!</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the air, along with a roar from within the spell formation. Suddenly, a huge black crocodile emerged, three hundred meters long!</p>
 <p>The crocodile slapped its tail down, causing ripples to spread out. Immediately, the 10,000 cultivators bearing the huge stone cauldron flew forward and landed on the crocodile’s back.</p>
 <p>The crocodile let out a roar, and its eyes began to glow red as it charged forward toward the Southern Domain.</p>
 <p>As for the several-meter-tall old man, his body emanated savage energy as he followed, acting as an escort to the crocodile.</p>
 <p>Behind him, the two old men, who looked identical except for the contrasting black and white clothing, both swished their sleeves. Shockingly, they began to emanate an incredible aura of death. Even more astonishing, two hopping vampires appeared behind them, also wearing contrasting black and white clothing! [1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi" target="_blank">Here is some info about "hopping vampires."</a> And <a href="http://oi64.tinypic.com/k3kpef.jpg" target="_blank">here is a picture</a>]</p>
 <p>The two hopping vampires had long teeth and vicious expressions. They wore hats, and moved in leaping motions along with the two old men as they escorted the stone cauldron.</p>
 <p>Last, was the young boy. As he advanced, a giant emerged from the forces atop the Resurrection Lily bridge. It wielded an enormous wolf-tooth club, and roared as it shot forward, kicking up a huge wind. The boy flew up to stand on its shoulder.</p>
 <p>He had eaten almost half of the Cinnabar Fruit, and held the other half in his hand, rubbing it occasionally.</p>
 <p>The crocodile in the lead position had bright red, glowing eyes. It roared as it advanced at top speed, transforming into what almost looked like a black lightning bolt. As it neared the Southern Domain, Pill Demon, Patriarch Song and the apprentice alchemist Sun Tao rushed to meet it.</p>
 <p>There was no talking. As soon as they met, the fighting began.</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>Sun Tao summoned a pill cauldron that emanated medicinal smoke. Within the smoke appeared countless warriors in golden armor that immediately blockaded the entire area.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Song gave a cold snort and performed an incantation gesture. Instantly, the spiritual energy in the area faded, and a copper coffin appeared, the precious treasure of the Song Clan.</p>
 <p>As for Pill Demon, he shot directly toward the stone cauldron.</p>
 <p>The crocodile roared, as did the several-meter-tall old man next to him. Suddenly, the old man flickered and appeared directly in front of the crocodile, then punched out.</p>
 <p>“Piss off!” he cried.</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>The fist strike was backed by the power of his fleshly body. It shattered the air as it screamed toward Sun Tao’s golden warriors. Immediately, the warriors began to wither and collapse into pieces.</p>
 <p>The old man was extraordinarily strong. Natural law swirled around him, making the entire area around him his own. He barreled forward, smashing through the barricade, followed by the crocodile.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the old men in the black and white clothes closed their eyes. Their bodies grew blurry, and astonishingly, they merged with the two hopping vampires behind them. The eyes of the hopping vampires suddenly began to glow with intelligence. As they leaped forward, their death aura rose up into the air, transforming into a vortex. Countless pale-white arms then stretched out from within the vortex. One of the hopping vampires shot toward Patriarch Song, the other headed to block Pill Demon.</p>
 <p>The last to make a move were the boy and the mountain-like giant. The giant brandished its wolf-tooth club, and the boy pointed out, causing Sun Tao’s face to fall. All of a sudden, a huge blister bulged out of the boy’s forehead. It was bright red, and looked exactly like a Cinnabar Fruit.</p>
 <p>A battle between peak Dao Seeking experts exploded out in the blink of an eye. Booms filled the air as Meng Hao approached, followed by his second true self and the left and right Dharma Protectors.</p>
 <p>“Hao’er,” said Pill Demon urgently. “Block that stone cauldron! Don’t let it touch the ground!”</p>
 <p>Having sized up the battle, Meng Hao’s eyes flashed, and he shot like lightning toward the crocodile.</p>
 <p>The several-meter-tall old man in front of the crocodile had a fleshly body that could crush enemies like dried weeds. When he saw Meng Hao approaching, he completely ignored Meng Hao and focused on the three peak Dao Seeking cultivators next to him.</p>
 <p>“SCREW OFFFFF!!” roared the old man, punching out into the air.</p>
