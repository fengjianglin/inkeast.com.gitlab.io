 <p><strong>Chapter 542: Clever Mastiff!</strong></p>
 <p>As he faced up against the pressure from the three hundred meter Area, Meng Hao focused all the power of his Sixth Anima Cultivation base into his hands. He lifted them up and then made a ripping motion.</p>
 <p>In response, the air in front of him distorted, and a snapping sound could be heard. It was as if some shapeless obstacle had suddenly been torn. Meng Hao’s body suddenly grew more relaxed, as if the invisible pressure had suddenly been removed.</p>
 <p>“Mastiff!” said Meng Hao, charging forward. The mastiff howled, causing its two hundred fifty meter Area to focus around Meng Hao, following him as he shot toward Patriarch Huyan.</p>
 <p>For the second time, Patriarch Huyan’s expression changed because of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>He gave a cold harrumph. As Meng Hao and the Mastiff neared, he lifted his right hand and flicked his sleeve out in front of him. No magical item appeared, nor any divine ability. The sleeve was flicked casually. However, for a Spirit Severing Patriarch, the simple flick of a sleeve would explode out with incredible power.</p>
 <p>The three hundred meter Area shrunk down to only one hundred fifty meters, causing its strength to double in intensity. The Area pushed down on everything with an incredible pressure that could suppress all divine abilities. Roaring filled the air as it slammed into Meng Hao and the mastiff and the one hundred fifty meter mark.</p>
 <p>Booming sounds rose up into the sky. Meng Hao’s right hand clenched into a fist and punched down. Roaring filled his body, as if this fist was capable of causing mountains to tremble. Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth, but his eyes glittered with a cold light. Thanks to this battle, he was now forming a much better understanding of Spirit Severing.</p>
 <p>The mastiff’s entire body trembled as it exploded with increased ferocity. The bloody light emanating from it pierced into the one hundred fifty meter Area. It also surrounded Meng Hao, forming a mighty power, allowing him to push forward with irresistible force.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao shot directly toward Patriarch Huyan. He stabbed clean through the one hundred fifty meter Area until he actually made contact with Patriarch Huyan!</p>
 <p>BAM!</p>
 <p>Blood flowed out from Patriarch Huyan’s mouth, and he was forced to retreat several paces. The bright glow in his eyes grew more intense. His one hundred fifty meter Area suddenly shrunk under the power of the attacks against it. It rebounded into a seventy-five meter Area before finally counterbalancing the attacks from Meng Hao and the mastiff.</p>
 <p>“This Immortal Beast is incredibly devious! It was actually concealing its true power!!” Patriarch Huyan’s eyes glittered with killing intent. His expression gradually became tranquil again. However, despite the calm look, he was shaken inwardly. To encounter a Nascent Soul Cultivator who could shake his Spirit Severing Area in such a way caused his desire to kill Meng Hao to grow even stronger. Before Meng Hao could back up, Patriarch Huyan advanced toward him along with his seventy-five meter Area.</p>
 <p>“After I kill you, I’ll skin this Immortal Beast and then debone it!” he said, his voice calm. Although his words contained no ripples of power, the killing intent they contained was incredibly obvious.</p>
 <p>The seventy-five meter Area was like a restricted zone; entering it would result in immediate injury. As it moved forward, the air vibrated. Seeing that it was about to reach Meng Hao, the mastiff howled, and its eyes filled with a fierce glow. It had grown up with Meng Hao, so in terms of conning people, you could say that it had inherited the ability from its master.</p>
 <p>Its own Area shrank and then shot forward. Its paws lifted into the air as it charged in a vicious attack.</p>
 <p>Its claws were incredibly sharp. They slashed through the air toward Patriarch Huyan’s advancing Area. Booms filled the air, and Patriarch Huyan’s entire body shook. He suddenly stopped moving. At the same time, the Blood Mastiff trembled and coughed up a mouthful of life Qi. Then, without even the slightest fear of death, it charged again.</p>
 <p>This time, it didn’t attack with its claws. It did not use its teeth either. Instead, it butted viciously with its head. This was Meng Hao’s mastiff, and even if it died, it would protect Meng Hao and kill his enemies!</p>
 <p>BANG!</p>
 <p>More blood oozed out of Patriarch Huyan’s mouth, and he was forced backward again. He looked at the fierce and increasingly vicious mastiff, and his killing intent soared to the Heavens. He now felt an unprecedented jealousy regarding Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Damnable Immortal Beast!! It… it was hiding even more power than it revealed before!! Immortal Beasts as treacherous as this are hard to come by!”</p>
 <p>Even as Patriarch Huyan defended himself yet again, Meng Hao’s cold voice suddenly rang out.</p>
 <p>“Seventh Anima!”</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s body grew rapidly once again. A violent, raging tempest sprang up around him. The sky dimmed and everything shook. His fleshly body grew even more powerful, to an astonishing degree. He now had far more power than thirty-two great circle Nascent Souls. Now he had… sixty-four!</p>
 <p>A Nascent Soul Cultivator like this was unparalleled in history. Most likely, there would never be someone similar in the future, either. Meng Hao’s hair whipped about. He was incredibly tall now, like an Immortal Demon. The strength of his fleshly body, his majestic battle prowess, and his incredible aura could shake the Heavens and Earth.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, he was the most powerful of Nascent Soul Cultivators, someone who could fight the Spirit Severing stage!</p>
 <p>He was now over half a meter taller than his original height. His shoulders were broad, his posture ramrod straight. He looked like a Devil Divinity, emanating an aura that would cause anyone to pant. His eyes were cold and sharp in such a way that made it seem as if everything in the area would surely freeze.</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” Patriarch Huyan’s face fell. As of this moment, Meng Hao was emanating an unprecedented pressure, something that Patriarch Huyan would only expect to see when facing up against someone of the same stage as himself!</p>
 <p>At the same moment in which Patriarch Huyan’s seventy-five meter Area neared Meng Hao, Meng Hao unhesitatingly shot forward. Relying only on the strength of his fleshly body, he charged directly into the seventy-five meter Area.</p>
 <p>BANG!</p>
 <p>Distorted ripples spread out through the seventy-five meter Area. It shrank down, turning into a thirty meter Area. Meng Hao, the spitting image of a Devil Divinity, immediately appeared thirty meters away from the shocked Patriarch Huyan. He clenched his fist and punched.</p>
 <p>This was not a divine ability, or a magical technique. There was no magical item involved. This was just the terrifying power of his fleshly body. The battle prowess of sixty-four great circle Nascent Souls, fused together. It formed… a shocking punch that had never before been seen in the Nascent Soul stage of the Cultivation world!</p>
 <p>BOOMMMMM!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s punch completely shattered the thirty meter Area, breaking it up into countless pieces that exploded out in all directions. A Spirit Severing Area, shattered!</p>
 <p>In the same moment, the mastiff howled and shot forward like lightning. Even as the Spirit Severing Area collapsed, it charged Patriarch Huyan, its sharp, awe-inspiring fangs savagely biting down.</p>
 <p>BAM!</p>
 <p>Patriarch Huyan waved both hands forward to block. His body shook violently, and he was sent tumbling backward, his face filling with an expression of utter disbelief and shock. He could never have possibly imagined that his Spirit Severing Area would be broken to pieces by a Nascent Soul Cultivator.</p>
 <p>Even as it was happening, he could scarcely believe it. As of now, his desire to kill Meng Hao had reached a pinnacle. In fact, deep in his heart, he had begun to regret provoking Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>A powerful expert like this, someone from the Nascent Soul stage who could battle against the Spirit Severing stage, was like a nightmare to any Cultivator. If he were not killed, it would likely result in the calamitous extermination of an entire Tribe.</p>
 <p>“You WILL die this day!” howled Patriarch Huyan. His eyes narrowed as he looked at Meng Hao, who was currently behind the mastiff. Meng Hao’s intrepid fleshly body caused Patriarch Huyan to pause momentarily as feelings of jealousy rose up within him. He suddenly performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing the image of an enormous wheel to suddenly appear in front of him.</p>
 <p>It was in this moment that Meng Hao shot forward through the air with another punch.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, he was closing in on Patriarch Huyan….</p>
 <p>“Wheel of Time, Universal Death! First Rotation, Time Destruction!” He performed a final incantation and then pushed his hand forward. The illusory image in front of him suddenly became clear. It was a black chariot wheel!</p>
 <p>It emanated the archaic feeling of time, and was branded with countless magical symbols. The magical symbols flickered with light as the wheel suddenly began to rotate.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s fist descended, and was just about the slam into the wheel, when suddenly an intense feeling filled his mind. The mastiff sensed it a bit faster; it suddenly grabbed him with his mouth and shot backward with him in retreat.</p>
 <p>At the same time, boundless Time power exploded out from the wheel. This type of power was different than than the type that Meng Hao wielded. This power was that of reversal. Meng Hao was astonished to see that even as he retreated, the Area which he had shattered was being restored. After having retreated more than sixty meters, Meng Hao’s Seventh Anima was beginning to dissolve.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Huyan smiled coldly, and his eyes shone with a cold disdain. He suddenly vanished, then shockingly reappeared right behind Meng Hao. He reached out and then gestured forward with his finger. The mastiff howled, and red light expanded as it shot forward to block the finger attack.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Huyan frowned and cursed inwardly as he forced the attack to complete. Booms could be heard as the red light shattered. Ignoring the incoming Blood Mastiff and its gaping mouth, Patriarch Huyan continued to stab his finger toward Meng Hao’s back.</p>
 <p>The finger attack landed, and a roaring could be heard. However, what it hit was layers of Eyeless Larva silk! The silk prevented ninety percent of the force of the blow from hitting Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The remaining ten percent slammed into Meng Hao, causing blood to spray from his mouth. As he tumbled forward, Patriarch Huyan was just about to pursue when the mastiff bit down. Patriarch Huyan trembled violently and blood sprayed from his mouth. He was forced to retreat backward several paces and abandon pursuit of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Tough little bastard!” said Patriarch Huyan through gritted teeth. He could only watch as Meng Hao sped away from him, while he was held up by the frenzied, crimson mastiff. Unable to pursue, he could only let out a cold harrumph. He knew that the power of Time was still going to envelop Meng Hao, and that there was nothing he could to do escape it.</p>
 <p>“Since that’s the case,” said Patriarch Huyan, performing an incantation gesture, “I’ll just slaughter this little animal of yours!” Booming filled the air and the mastiff howled as its Area was shattered. However, the red glow coming off of its body suddenly transformed into countless red spikes that shot toward Patriarch Huyan. The battle between the two instantly exploded out. At the same time, Patriarch Huyan’s eyes flickered as he continuously sought an opportunity to kill Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>All of these things happened in the time it takes a spark to fly up off of a piece of flint. The blood that had sprayed from Meng Hao’s mouth as he was sent tumbling suddenly seemed as if it was about to return into his mouth.</p>
