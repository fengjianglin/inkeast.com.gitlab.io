 <p>Meng Hao looked at the multiple versions of Lord White, his eyes flickering with scintillating light.</p>
 <p>“Can’t be killed and won’t die. Is that because of your life force?” Meng Hao suddenly waved his hand, summoning the copper mirror once again. This time, however, he didn't form it into the Battle Weapon, but instead reached his left hand deep into the mirror itself!</p>
 <p>The copper mirror was like a black hole that completely swallowed up his hand. At the same time, the mirror trembled, as if some enormous power was stirring within. Roars and howls echoed out, the mere sound of which caused the faces of the numerous versions of Lord White to flicker. Furthermore, the area which had previously been cut off from the Mountain and Sea Realm by Lord White was now showing signs of collapsing.</p>
 <p>“Demon Weapon Lonelytomb...” Meng Hao said softly, eyes shining, “the time has finally come for you to truly appear in the world!” Based on the level of his current cultivation base, he was able to sense that... he could at long last completely and fully pull out the fragment of the mirror he had acquired in the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect, as well as that which was inside of it, Demon Weapon Lonelytomb! [1. It was around <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-4-chapter-619/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 619</a> that he acquired that mirror fragment in the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect]</p>
 <p>Furthermore, this was not the incomplete Demon Weapon which he had pulled out in the last fight with Lord White. This was... the complete, authentic Demon Weapon Lonelytomb!</p>
 <p>The world inside the copper mirror was something no one on the outside could see. Deep within the mirror was an ancient battlefield, filled with so many broken corpses that they were heaped together like mountains. In the middle of all of that was a seething black mist, inside of which was a long black spear that radiated brutal madness.</p>
 <p>It also pulsed with an intense murderous aura, which caused rumbling sounds to echo out. It was as if the number of souls killed by this spear throughout the years literally couldn't be counted....</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, an enormous hand reached down out of the Heavens of that world, which was none other than Meng Hao’s hand. It pierced through the black mist and wrapped around the Demon Weapon Lonelytomb.</p>
 <p>An intense drone of excitement exploded out of the spear, as if it could sense the fluctuations of the League of Demon Sealers. It had been waiting for far more than 10,000 years... for a cultivator from the League to come release it into the world once more!</p>
 <p>The hand wrapped around Demon Weapon Lonelytomb and then pulled it up into the Heavens….</p>
 <p>Out in the Eighth Mountain and Sea, Meng Hao’s hand slowly emerged from the copper mirror, which was trembling and emanating dazzling light that spread out in all directions.</p>
 <p>There was also a vast quantity of black mist which roiled out, filling the entire area with a towering murderous aura, as if countless discarnate souls were screaming and wailing in anguish.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as Meng Hao’s hand emerged, clutched within which was a long black spear. At long last, Demon Weapon Lonelytomb... had returned to the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>It was nine meters long, completely pitch black, and surrounded by swirling black mist and the images of countless vengeful spirits. The murderous aura it emanated contained shocking pressure that made everything rumble. It was as if all the life in the starry sky was being sliced to pieces to be consumed by the newly-arrived Demon Weapon Lonelytomb!</p>
 <p>Even more shocking was that after consuming that life force, the Demon Weapon’s murderous aura grew even stronger. It needed more, it thirsted for more, causing Heaven and Earth to shake violently.</p>
 <p>The dozens of versions of Lord White began to struggle violently, expressions flickering with astonishment and shock.</p>
 <p>“An undying, unkillable life force...?” Meng Hao said, lips twisting into a cold smile. He took a step forward, and Demon Weapon Lonelytomb transformed into a black bolt of lightning that shot out.</p>
 <p>It was only a spear, but when it stabbed into the forehead of one of the Lord Whites, it pierced directly through him, withering his body. In the blink of an eye, he shattered into pieces, his life force completely and utterly consumed by Demon Weapon Lonelytomb.</p>
 <p>The Demon Weapon, which had previously been pitch black, all of a sudden had a blood-colored glint to it that even bordered on violet!</p>
 <p>In the same moment, the rest of the versions of Lord White finally managed to shake off the Hexing magic, and began to scatter, fleeing in all directions.</p>
 <p>“You can’t escape,” Meng Hao said coolly. He didn’t pursue them, though. Instead, the bloody glow surrounding the Demon Weapon transformed into a beam of blood-colored light, which sped out into the starry sky. The starry sky trembled as the barrier erected by Lord White shattered. Instantly, the power of the Mountains and Seas could sense the presence of an Outsider, and as a result, the entire Mountain and Sea Realm began to shake violently.</p>
 <p>Atop the Nine Mountains, the Xuanwu turtles in the nine celestial ponds threw their heads back and roared. The Mountains and Seas shook, and all of the Mountain and Sea Lords could suddenly sense the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>“Outsiders must be executed!!” These words rumbled out into the minds of all of the Mountain and Sea Lords. On the Ninth Mountain, Ji Tian’s eyes shone with a strange glow as he looked in the direction of the Eighth Mountain and Sea.</p>
 <p>On the Eighth Mountain, Meng Hao’s grandfather, the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea, was shaking violently. His hands were quivering, and a shocking aura was erupting up within him as his eyes slowly opened!</p>
 <p>In the Sixth Mountain and Sea, countless cultivators were massed together into a huge army that was marching forward into a rift that connected to the Fifth Mountain and Sea. It was not just in the Eighth Mountain and Sea that a Mountain and Sea War was being fought, nor was the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea the only traitor!</p>
 <p>There was another traitor... the Lord of the Sixth Mountain and Sea!</p>
 <p>War had broken out in the Fifth Mountain and Sea, and the two Lords of those respective Mountains and Seas were both bursting with power. Although they had not yet begun to fight, they were now facing off.</p>
 <p>It was in that moment that they heard the voice of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>The entire Mountain and Sea Realm was shaking, and countless faces flickered with shock. An astonishing power was building up, converging on Meng Hao’s location in the Eighth Mountain and Sea, and then crushing down onto the fleeing Lord White.</p>
 <p>That was Meng Hao’s entire goal. He wanted to sever the power that Lord White was able to wield because of his status as the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea, that allowed him to block the will of the Mountains and Seas. Once his Outsider aura spread out and was detected, killing him would be a very simple task.</p>
 <p>In fact, Meng Hao didn’t even need to attack at this point. The power of the Mountain and Sea Realm would kill Lord White for him!</p>
 <p>Amidst rumbling sounds, Lord White let out a miserable scream as the will of the Mountains and Seas descended. However, even as he was about to be shredded out of existence, the starry sky shook as a massive pressure descended from the 33 Heavens up above.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a huge golden net appeared, which covered the entire Mountain and Sea Realm. Beyond that net could be seen numerous land masses stacked up like a pagoda. Clearly visible on the first land mass, the one nearest to the Mountain and Sea Realm, were mountains and rivers, as well as a group of cultivators with stern, arrogant expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>This was the 1st Heaven of the 33 Heavens. Similar scenes could be seen playing out on the 2nd Heaven, the 3rd Heaven, and all of the other various land masses that were stacked higher up. Furthermore, it appeared as if the cultivators there had just begun to gather, and that it would most likely take many years for them to finish massing their forces together.</p>
 <p>After all, each and every one of those Heavens was comparable in size to the Mountain and Sea Realm itself!</p>
 <p>Beyond that huge golden net, was a figure clad in golden battle armor, floating above the 1st Heaven, staring down at the Mountain and Sea Realm. Suddenly, he cried out in a furious voice. “Mountain and Sea Realm, if you dare to kill someone from our 1st Heaven, then the war will begin early!”</p>
 <p>That figure looked like a cultivator, except that his body was covering in scales, and a long tail stretched out behind him. Two vicious horns sprouted from his head, and his eyes were icy cold.</p>
 <p>“Allow him to return, and I’ll pretend none of this ever happened. The Mountain and Sea Realm will then have years to prepare. The war between us is coming, and it will end with the eradication of either the Mountains and Seas or our 33 Heaven!</p>
 <p>“Do you want that war to start now, or years from now? All rests on a single sentence from you, the Mountain and Sea Realm!”</p>
 <p>Massive rumbling accompanied the voice, which pierced into the Mountain and Sea Realm and exploded out in the Eighth Mountain and Sea. However, the echoing voice could also be heard by all cultivators in the entire Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>In fact, any cultivator in the Mountain and Sea Realm who looked up would be able to see the huge net spreading out up above, and the 33 land masses beyond it!!</p>
 <p>The entire Realm was completely stunned!</p>
 <p>Although rumors about the 33 Heavens had long since begun to spread, and many people knew about them, as of this moment, everyone was astonished to be able to hear the words spoken by the golden-armored Outsider from the 1st Heaven.</p>
 <p>It was brazen intimidation!</p>
 <p>He was openly threatening the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm; if it dared to slaughter Lord White, then the result would be the premature outbreak of a war of eradication!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was shaking, and brilliant light flickered within his eyes. He had never imagined that killing Lord White would provoke such a reaction from the 33 Heavens, to the extent that they were willing to wage war ahead of schedule!!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm froze, and ceased in its attempt to kill Lord White. At the same time, the remaining versions of Lord White all merged back together into his original form. His face was pale, and he was trembling, but the fact that he had just escaped with his life caused his eyes to shine with incredible joy, even elation!</p>
 <p>The will of the Mountain and Sea Realm was silent. The Xuanwu turtles on the Nine Mountains grew quiet. None of the Mountain and Sea Lords spoke. All cultivators, regardless of whether they were fighting on the battlefield or were in a location of peace and quiet, were completely shaken, and stared up in confusion at the starry sky above.</p>
 <p>None of them were ready for such a war, and in fact, most of them hadn’t even been aware that a war was coming.</p>
 <p>And yet... the 33 Heavens, despite not being fully prepared, had already begun to gather forces. If they still needed years to prepare, then so did the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was also silent. This was a decision that had to do with the survival of the Mountain and Sea Realm itself. His first inclination was to let Lord White go, and avoid an early outbreak of war.</p>
 <p>After all, he hadn’t made adequate preparations to fight against the 33 Heavens right at this moment.</p>
 <p>A cold snort rang out from the 33 Heavens, and a huge black hand pierced down through the golden net. It descended to the Eighth Mountain and Sea, grabbed Lord White and then slowly pulled him up.</p>
 <p>The decision had been made. The Mountain and Sea Realm didn’t dare to attack, didn’t dare to start the war early. That was a war which would decide the fate of all lives in the Realm, and no one was confident enough to start it yet.</p>
 <p>However... that was when something completely unexpected happened!!</p>
