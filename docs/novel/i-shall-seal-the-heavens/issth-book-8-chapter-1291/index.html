 <p>It was almost as if Meng Hao didn’t even notice those incoming cultivators. He proceeded along as before, but then casually waved his hand. Instantly, the dozen or so cultivators began to tremble. Their faces went slack, then they toppled over and became a part of the surrounding ruins.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao didn’t kill them, but rather dispersed their consciousness, putting them into a state of sleep from which they would awaken in a few months.</p>
 <p>As he traveled through the Heavengod Alliance, he noticed many places where planets had once existed which were now nothing more than rubble. Everything was in ruins, and corpses could be seen everywhere, cultivators from both the Eighth and the Seventh Mountain and Sea.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s face was very grim as he went along, getting deeper and deeper into the territory of the Heavengod Alliance. Up ahead, he could sense Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering ripples, and could even hear the sounds of screaming mixed in, along with massive explosions.</p>
 <p>That was clearly... where the front lines of the battle were.</p>
 <p>His divine sense expanded out, spreading out through virtually the entire Heavengod Alliance. In that whole area, there were only two people he cared about. One was the Noble Ran, and the other... was on the Eighth Mountain.</p>
 <p>In fact, those two people were the entire reason why he had come here to begin with.</p>
 <p>With his divine sense, Meng Hao could see that half of the former Heavengod Alliance’s territory was now in complete ruin, and was controlled by the Seventh Mountain and Sea. By now, their cultivators numbered in the millions, and had been divided into four main armies which stabbed into the Heavengod Alliance from four different directions.</p>
 <p>The cultivators of the Heavengod Alliance were also split into four main armies to defend against the various offenses. However, it was obvious that they were being forced inexorably back, and would eventually be defeated. There was little hope of achieving victory.</p>
 <p>Not too far away from Meng Hao, in the starry sky of the Heavengod Alliance, in the most bloody and bitter of the four battlefields, a shattered planet was transforming into a black hole, and had begun swallowing up many of the surrounding cultivators.</p>
 <p>A grand battle was being fought here, with more than 700,000 cultivators on each side. It was a spectacular, sprawling fight, and at any particular moment the shrill cries of the dying could be heard.</p>
 <p>Explosions echoed out constantly, and the glow of magical techniques rose up high into the starry sky. Terrifying ripples spread out chaotically, and the entire scene was one of disorder.</p>
 <p>Higher up was where the Dao Realm experts were fighting. Meng Hao could see the Chief Dharma Protector of the Heavengod Society, as well as... the boy Xiao Yihan. The two of them were locked in a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering battle.</p>
 <p>Clearly, the Chief Dharma Protector was no match for Xiao Yihan. However, he wore a green suit of armor that boosted his power to the point where he could at least hold his own.</p>
 <p>There were more than a few Dao Realm experts in the battle, and wherever they fought, massive booms and explosions echoed out.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao caught sight of the first Patriarch of the Righteous Noble Sect, who was in a very sorry state and seemed to be on his last legs. Meng Hao continued to scan the battlefield until he finally found the Noble Ran.</p>
 <p>Shockingly, he was up against two Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, who were attacking him in unison. It was a breathtaking battle, and unfortunately, he was weakening by the moment. His body a mass of wounds and injuries, and his face was completely ashen. He looked like an oil lamp running low on fuel, sputtering on the verge of being extinguished.</p>
 <p>As soon as Meng Hao caught sight of him, his eyes flickered coldly, and he took a step in that direction.</p>
 <p>On the battlefield itself, the Noble Ran was laughing bitterly. Booms rang out, and blood spurted from his wounds as he was forced back relentlessly. His injuries were many and serious; in the past months, he had been in so many fights he had lost count.</p>
 <p>Despite fighting so bitterly, the mad advance of the Seventh Mountain and Sea was unstoppable. The Righteous Noble Sect... was no more. Vast numbers of disciples had been killed, and the third Patriarch was dead. Only the Noble Ran and the first Patriarch remained.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps this battle... is where I will perish,” thought the Noble Ran as he performed an incantation gesture, once again fighting back against his two Dao Realm opponents. One of those opponents was a middle-aged man, the other was elderly. Their cultivation bases were at the same level as his, and they attacked with complete viciousness. They clearly wanted to kill the Noble Ran more than anything else, and in response to his move, they unleashed their Essence power, creating a huge mountain of ice, within which was sealed a black eyeball.</p>
 <p>As the mountain sped toward the Noble Ran, it melted, creating a powerful blast of freezing air. Cracking sounds could be heard as everything froze over and was covered by layer after layer of frost. Simultaneously, the black eyeball flew out, becoming a black beam of light that shot toward the Noble Ran.</p>
 <p>He laughed bitterly as the freezing ice spread out over his body, and the black beam of light closed in. Finally, he bit his tongue and spit out a glob of blood, which transformed into a blood mist that blocked the black light.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds could be heard, and a stubborn gleam appeared in the Noble Ran’s eyes. He took a deep breath and then said, “The Dao is in My Heart!”</p>
 <p>Instantly, the ice covering him cracked and then shattered away.</p>
 <p>The two Dao Realm experts he was facing began to laugh coldly.</p>
 <p>“That move again? Noble Ran, we’ve fought back and forth numerous times, and this isn’t the first time you've tried to use that Seal the Heavens Incantation, and it never works! Anybody can see that it's a completely worthless incantation!”</p>
 <p>“The Seal the Heavens Incantation is a complete joke. I've heard people say that you got it to work once, is that right? To tell you the truth, I really look forward to seeing that happen. I want to see this ‘Seal the Heavens Incantation’ that you supposedly used to block tens of thousands of opponents at the same time.” The two Dao Realm experts continued to laugh coldly. Instead of unleashing attacks, they merely hovered there, looking at the Noble Ran with cold cynicism.</p>
 <p>Their words stung, but the Noble Ran’s eyes gleamed with stubborness. He had succeeded, albeit only once. However, that one time in which he had succeeded had given his apprentice the chance to escape.</p>
 <p>That one success was something he would never forget.</p>
 <p><em>The Seal the Heavens Incantation is not worthless!!</em></p>
 <p>“The Will is in My Eyes!” roared the Noble Ran, then gritted his teeth as he assumed the proper pose, to further mockery from his opponents.</p>
 <p>“I Shall Possess the Mountains and Seas, Seal the Heavens Incantation!” The Noble Ran threw his head back and roared, splaying both arms out wide and then waving them out. However... absolutely no magical technique appeared.</p>
 <p>The Noble Ran’s eyes faded, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. He chuckled bitterly, and yet deep inside he still believed that the Seal the Heavens Incantation was not worthless.</p>
 <p>“How many times have you tried to use that magic? Every single time you prove that it's a completely worthless incantation!”</p>
 <p>“What a pity. We’ve still never even seen this so-called Seal the Heavens Incantation.” The two cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea shook their heads and then began to speed toward the Noble Ran, pulsing with killing intent.</p>
 <p>In his bitterness, the Noble Ran slowly began to speak, more to himself than to anyone else, “It's not a worthless incantation, it's the Seal the Heavens Incantation, which I created myself.... The Seal the Heavens Incantation!</p>
 <p>“I succeeded once before....” he murmured. He had paid an unimaginable price to create the Seal the Heavens Incantation, and the memories of what had occurred were something he didn’t like to recall. It was an incredible pain that he kept hidden away deep in his heart.</p>
 <p>RUMBLE!</p>
 <p>As the two Dao Realm experts closed in, they joined forces to unleash a powerful magical technique. The image of a huge black centipede appeared, a vicious creature which opened its mouth as if to consume the Noble Ran.</p>
 <p>“Take your worthless incantation with you into death!”</p>
 <p>However, it was at this point that an icy cold voice suddenly echoed out across the battlefield, exploding into the ears of the two Dao Realm cultivators.</p>
 <p>“You people want to see the Seal the Heavens Incantation? Well then, I’ll give you that chance right now.... The Dao is in My Heart!” As soon as the words “The Dao is in My Heart” echoed out, massive rumbling filled Heaven and Earth and everything shook. At the same time, a shocking aura spread out to fill the starry sky.</p>
 <p>The two Dao Realm experts’ faces fell. The voice from just now had pierced into their minds, causing them to tremble physically. They looked up into the starry sky and saw a figure approaching.</p>
 <p>That figure wore a long robe, and his descent caused the more than a million fiercely fighting cultivators on the battlefield to be filled with shock. As for his words, they echoed about like the crash of thunder.</p>
 <p>This new arrival was none other than Meng Hao!</p>
 <p>When the Noble Ran saw him, he began to tremble, and his eyes filled with happiness. He began to laugh, and the look in his eyes turned to that of excitement.</p>
 <p>“My little disciple, my little disciple....”</p>
 <p>“The Will is in My Eyes!” Meng Hao said, which was the second line of the incantation. His voice echoed out, booming like thunder, causing the two Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea to cough up blood. Looks of shock and disbelief flashed across their faces.</p>
 <p>They weren’t the only ones. The other Dao Realm experts in the area all looked over in astonishment. Of course, what was most shocking to them was not just the power of Meng Hao’s voice, but the fact that all of a sudden... an indescribable pressure had begun to weigh down on them.</p>
 <p>That boundless pressure felt like an enormous mountain crushing down onto their backs.</p>
 <p>It was... the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>The first Patriarch of the Righteous Noble Sect looked on in astonishment. The other Dao Realm experts on both sides of the battlefield felt their minds spinning. As for the Chief Dharma Protector of the Heavengod Society, when he recognized Meng Hao, he immediately gasped.</p>
 <p>However, the one who was most shocked wasn’t him, it was... the boy Xiao Yihan. He looked at Meng Hao with wide eyes for a moment before turning around and fleeing.</p>
 <p>That was the reaction of the Dao Realm experts. As for all of the other million or more cultivators on the battlefield, the power of the Mountains and Seas caused them to tremble, and their minds to reel. Instantly, all of the fighting completely stopped. All because of a single person!</p>
 <p>“I Shall Possess the Mountains and Seas....” Meng Hao said, the third line of the incantation. The entire starry sky was filled with booming sounds like those of war drums, sounds that caused everyone present to be completely shaken. Their minds buzzed as the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm seemed to become even stronger than before.</p>
 <p>It was as if massive power had built up and was now being released, creating a pressure that overwhelmed the minds of everyone present. It was a pressure that didn’t just affect their cultivation bases; it actually caused everyone to stop breathing.</p>
 <p>Only the Noble Ran was smiling. As for the two Dao Realm opponents he had been fighting, their faces were ashen, and their minds spun out of control.</p>
 <p>The entire world, the entire starry sky, seemed to converge upon Meng Hao. They watched as Meng Hao... spoke the third line, stretched his hands out wide, then waved them toward the starry sky, simultaneously speaking the final words of the incantation.</p>
 <p>“Seal... the Heavens... Incantation!”</p>
