 <p>When the Milky Way Sea merged with the Violet Sea, its color changed; it was now indigo-blue!</p>
 <p>The water on the surface churned, and the foamy waves suddenly looked like hair floating up from within the sea.</p>
 <p>The enormous Resurrection Lily bridge that connected the Southern Domain and the Northern Reaches suddenly began to tremble. Then the tentacles retracted from both the shores of the Southern Domain and the Northern Reaches!</p>
 <p>They pulled back to the surface of the Milky Way Sea to form… a shocking Resurrection Lily!</p>
 <p>A seven-colored Resurrection Lily!</p>
 <p>The Resurrection Lily was blooming, and its colors were fading along with the Milky Way Sea’s change in color. It now bore the semblance of an indigo-blue lotus.</p>
 <p>Boundless spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth surged toward the Blue Lotus that had once been a Resurrection Lily, as if the process of transformation desperately needed the entire planet’s energy.</p>
 <p>Colors flashed in the sky, and the winds screamed. The Ji Clan immediately noticed these phenomena, and the clan members’ minds were shaken.</p>
 <p>In the lands of the Southern Domain, the ordinary cultivators didn’t notice anything more than a slight reduction in the spiritual energy around them. However, the Dao Seeking experts up in midair could detect the astonishing changes that were occurring in the direction of the Milky Way Sea.</p>
 <p>The number one most powerful expert of the Northern Reaches, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, couldn’t help but look shocked. The other peak Dao Seeking experts of the Northern Reaches were also astonished. Now that the Resurrection Lily bridge had disappeared, they had no escape route back to the Northern Reaches!</p>
 <p>“Dammit!” Their faces fell.</p>
 <p>As for Pill Demon and Patriarch Song, their eyes flickered with killing intent. They weren’t sure what the Resurrection Lily was planning to do. Right now, the most important task at hand was slaughtering the Northern Reaches cultivators!</p>
 <p>Even if the sky were falling, they would still fight as desperately as before.</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the air, and fierce fighting raged. The three parties of the Northern Reaches, the Southern Domain and the Western Desert all fought bitterly. The Dao Seeking experts up in midair were the same. With the addition of the forces from the Western Desert, the battle was now much more even.</p>
 <p>It was now a fair fight!</p>
 <p>However, the battle was being fought in the Southern Domain, the home of the Southern Domain cultivators. If the fighting kept going on much longer, the Northern Reaches cultivators would surely be beaten!</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the Southern Domain and the Western Desert would have to pay a grievous price to win this war. However, it had to be won, no matter the cost. Anything was better than the foundation of their cultivation being destroyed.</p>
 <p>“Kill them!”</p>
 <p>The ground trembled and blood flowed everywhere. The sky was rent, and wild winds whipped across the land. The entire rotation of South Heaven was influenced.</p>
 <p>In fact, there were even some areas of the Southern Domain which quaked so badly that the land collapsed, allowing the Milky Way Sea to rush in.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Imperial Bloodline Clan’s ancestral statuary floated in midair, emanating an ancient aura. Inside the cage, Meng Hao was now facing the most critical danger he had ever faced in his life.</p>
 <p>The cage’s world was shrinking. As of this moment, he could see that the entire world was barely 30,000 meters wide!</p>
 <p>An intense pressure bore down on him, sealing him completely.</p>
 <p>Blood oozed out of his mouth. He performed incantation gestures to summon divine abilities. The Blood Demon Grand Magic raged as he attempted to break through the seal. However, nothing worked. No amount of power did anything to affect the area around him.</p>
 <p>He could only watch, wide-eyed, as the 30,000-meter world became 25,000 meters, and then continued to shrink.</p>
 <p>“Dammit!” he said, his eyes bloodshot. He flew up into the air, focusing all the power of his cultivation base to transform into a shooting star that sped up into the sky in the hopes of making a hole and breaking out.</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s body shook violently and he coughed up a huge mouthful of blood. He slammed back into the ground, having done absolutely nothing to weaken the power of the seal.</p>
 <p>The area was continuing to shrink. Now there were only 20,000 meters left!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s head suddenly jerked up. His hair was in disarray, and his body was filled with rumbling. He took all of the qi and blood power that he had absorbed earlier and focused it in his right hand, creating… the most powerful punch he had ever unleashed.</p>
 <p>At the same time, his cultivation base exploded with incredible ripples, as he focused all of the cultivation base power he had absorbed into his right hand. By now, his right hand was glowing with a blinding, dazzling light.</p>
 <p>“Souls!” Meng Hao roared, and vast quantities of struggling souls screamed out. Hundreds of thousands of them seemed to blot out the sky. Then Meng Hao’s hand became a black hole that began to suck in the souls.</p>
 <p>By now, his fist contained a terrifying destructive power, a power that was the absolute peak of what he could summon. He flew up and then struck out at the sealing barrier which surrounded him.</p>
 <p>A massive boom raged out which caused the entire world to shake. Time ground to a halt, and a gigantic vortex ripped open that seemed capable of sucking the whole world into it.</p>
 <p>Heaven and Earth distorted, and cracking sounds could be heard. The seal seemed to be on the verge of falling apart, until… the stone monkey in the middle of the world suddenly opened its eyes. A bizarre light shone out, which then surrounded the entire world.</p>
 <p>Everything seemed to be freezing over!</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>The vortex collapsed, and the distortion disappeared. Everything returned to normal. The previous 20,000 meter distance was now 10,000!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao coughed up some blood and backed up. The world was shrinking too much, and the pressure weighing down on him had doubled. He coughed up more blood.</p>
 <p>An archaic voice echoed out from the stone statue.</p>
 <p>“The world of Immortals is the source of all chaos. Immortals are the source of all slaughter. The Immortal Realm must be sealed! Immortals must be suppressed!”</p>
 <p>The pressure grew more intense, and Meng Hao could hear cracking sounds inside of him, as if his bones were being broken.</p>
 <p>Anyone else in this situation would already have been crushed out of existence; it was only because of his incredibly powerful fleshly body that he could hold out.</p>
 <p>“What the hell are you talking about?!” he said. The words spoken by the stone monkey didn’t make any sense to him. However, his eyes were completely shot with blood, and the killing intent he felt in his heart continued to grow stronger. Being stuck in this sealing cage was causing him to feel completely helpless.</p>
 <p>“I was a bit too weak just now,” he thought. “This stone monkey’s gaze negates anything I do! I don’t have the power to break open the cage, but… I can borrow some power!” His eyes suddenly filled with a gleam of determination. He took a deep breath, and no longer made any attempts to violently break out. Instead, he sank back down to the ground and sat down cross-legged, a profound look in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I’ve already reached an understanding regarding the path of my Third Severing…. I’ve only been hesitant about the correctness of the path. But now… I might as well just go ahead with it!</p>
 <p>“I’ll borrow the power of the blade of the Third Severing, the Dao Severing blade, to break open this cage!” His eyes gleamed with decisiveness.</p>
 <p>“My First Severing cut away the Resurrection Lily, and carved out freedom. That was my direction!</p>
 <p>“My Second Severing cut away the past, and carved out my Dao Fruit!</p>
 <p>“My Third Severing… will cut away the Devil in my heart! I will carve away my desire to become Devilish. That is Devil Severing!</p>
 <p>“I must… Sever the Devil and Seek the Dao!” When he looked up, an intense glow could be seen in his eyes. He took a deep breath and began to rotate his cultivation base. He used all of the power of his cultivation base to stimulate the blade of the Third Severing!</p>
 <p>In Spirit Severing, there were three blades. As long as one was confident of the Dao, and one’s spirit was ready, the blades could link with Heaven and Earth to cause a Dao blade to descend!</p>
 <p>If the Severing was correct, then the cultivation base would experience a breakthrough. If the Severing was incorrect, the body would perish and the Dao would dissipate!</p>
 <p>Spirit Severing cultivators who were not 100% confident would not easily perform a Severing. What they feared most was realizing at the last minute that they had Severed incorrectly. Their fate would then be death.</p>
 <p>The First Severing was difficult, and the Second was incredibly dangerous. As for the Third Severing… that was the most critical of junctures!</p>
 <p>If the Severing was correct, then the cultivator would step into Dao Seeking. If it was incorrect, the cultivator would die. If the Severing was somewhere in between, neither correct nor incorrect, the result was an existence of being crippled. No further advancements would be possible, and they would forever remain in the Third Severing stage until their longevity ran out and they returned to the dust.</p>
 <p>As for what was correct and what was incorrect, the answer could only be found in the heart of the cultivator!</p>
 <p>If the heart was correct, everything was correct. If the heart was incorrect, so everything else would be!</p>
 <p>It had been a profound mystery since ancient times, and even in modern days, no one completely understood the matter.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s cultivation suddenly surged out. It was irrelevant that he was in a cage, or that he was sealed. The Dao was amorphous, and although places existed in Heaven and Earth where there was no Dao, clearly… this cage was not one of those places!</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as Meng Hao’s cultivation base exploded out to call his blade of the Third Severing, lightning and thunder crashed in the world outside. Rumbling filled the air, and the sky split. A vortex appeared, and the power of a great Dao suddenly emerged.</p>
 <p>This great Dao power descended from the starry sky, nearing the lands of South Heaven, and the battlefield on the Southern Domain!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, virtually all of the cultivators down below could sense the power of the great Dao. One by one, looks of shock appeared on their faces.</p>
 <p>“That’s… a great Dao of Spirit Severing!”</p>
 <p>“Who’s calling to a Dao of Spirit Severing!?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me someone is about to break through to Spirit Severing right in the middle of the battlefield!?”</p>
 <p>Despite the fact that battle was raging, the appearance of the power of a great Dao made it impossible for people to remain calm. From the expressions on the faces of the peak Dao Seeking experts of the three territories, it was clear that they were thoroughly astonished.</p>
 <p>Their gazes swept about, but none of them could see anyone who seemed to be attaining Spirit Severing enlightenment.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that suddenly, the rumbling great Dao power intensified by tenfold. The vortex up above seemed to be completely obscured. It was as if nothing were left in the world except for the great Dao.</p>
 <p>Even the cultivators who were locked in vicious combat suddenly found that it was extremely difficult to utilize any magical techniques or divine abilities. It was as if they were being assimilated by the great Dao.</p>
 <p>It was the same with the peak Dao Seeking experts up in midair. People began to gasp, and expressions of shock could be seen everywhere.</p>
 <p>“That’s not a blade of First Severing, that’s a Third Severing blade!”</p>
 <p>“That can’t be right! There’s never been a Third Severing blade with such astonishing power before!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me that….”</p>
 <p>Rumbling echoed out as the power of the great Dao grew more intense. The entire sky of the lands of South Heaven was shaking and blurred. And yet, the power of the great Dao grew even stronger. Even the Resurrection Lily in the Milky Way Sea was astonished.</p>
 <p>The power of this great Dao was shocking the entire world. It was like a wall that prevented anyone on the battlefield from attacking. Their expressions were that of shock as they realized that the Imperial Bloodline Clan’s ancestral statuary cage was now emanating intense light.</p>
 <p>After looking closely, it was possible to see that the source of that light was none other than Meng Hao, who was still in the cage!</p>
 <p>The bright light appeared to be some sort of resonance!</p>
 <p>A Great Dao Resonance!</p>
