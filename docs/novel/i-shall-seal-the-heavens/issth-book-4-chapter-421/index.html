 <p><strong>Chapter 421: THAT Fishing Line!</strong></p>
 <p>Mo Fang’s body exploded into pieces. However, his flesh and blood did not disappear, but rather congealed together. In the blink of an eye, it formed eight Flood Dragon heads. Another moment later, a three hundred meter long, eight-headed Flood Dragon was there in front of Mo Zi.</p>
 <p>Mo Zi’s eyes were bright red as he lifted his head back and howled. The Flood Dragon in front of him let out a roar as it sped toward the incoming Flying Rain-Dragon.</p>
 <p>“Kill them!” cried Mo Zi frenziedly.</p>
 <p>The eight-headed Flood Dragon was much different than an ordinary Flood Dragon and was just barely able to stand up to the pressure exerted by the Flying Rain-Dragon. It charged forward with a howl, then slammed into the Flying Rain-Dragon.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s expression was the same as ever as he watched on coldly. The surrounding Dragoneers observed the scene with shock. Outside of the golden shield, the members of the five great Tribes were panting. All of them were paying close attention to this battle of dragons!</p>
 <p>A boom rose up into the sky, along with a miserable shriek. Three out of eight of the Flood Dragon’s heads transformed into clouds of blood and gore as the Flying Rain-Dragon swallowed them up. The remaining five heads let out frantic cries and tried to bite the Flying Rain-Dragon. The Flying Rain-Dragon lifted its head up to the sky and roared. It sounded as if its dignity had been encroached upon! Its body began to grow larger until it was several hundred meters larger. Then it slammed once again into the Flood Dragon.</p>
 <p>Everything shook as a massive explosion rippled out. The rest of the Flood Dragon’s five heads let out shrieks, and its entire body trembled. Looks of terror appeared on its faces, and it was just beginning to retreat when a huge boom could be heard. The entire Flood Dragon began to explode into blood and flesh. In response, the Flying Rain-Dragon sucked all of it in and swallowed it in one huge gulp.</p>
 <p>Mo Zi was scared out of his mind. His brain spun as he backed up.</p>
 <p>“I forfeit!!” he cried, completely overcome by his terror. It was at this moment of crisis that a golden light swirled out toward him from the golden shield, preparing to pull him out of the platform.</p>
 <p>The Flying Rain-Dragon roared again. Suddenly flames appeared, as if its body were about to burn up. The flames rose up into the sky as the Flying Rain-Dragon shot toward Mo Zi. The instant Mo Zi was about to be pulled out from within the golden shield, the Flying Rain-Dragon slammed into the golden light, blocking it.</p>
 <p>“When Meng Hao wants to kill someone, nobody can interfere!” said Meng Hao coolly. He slowly lifted his right finger. Immediately the image of a Greenwood Tree became visible on his forehead. Wood-type power emanated out, following the direction of Meng Hao’s finger to shoot toward the golden shield.</p>
 <p>Because the golden shield was made up of Wood- and Metal-type energy, the power of the Greenwood Tree caused it to begin to ripple and distort. The Flying Rain-Dragon stretched its head out. Just when Mo Zi was heaving a sigh of relief as he thought he was about to escape, everything went black.</p>
 <p>That was because the Flying Rain-Dragon’s mouth had latched onto him.</p>
 <p>A miserable shriek could be heard from Mo Zi, which was cut off by crunching sounds. The top half of Mo Zi’s body was swallowed down by the Flying Rain-Dragon.</p>
 <p>This was what it meant to break the fangs!</p>
 <p>The Flying Rain-Dragon slowly dissipated. The shocking scene immediately caused a huge commotion among the members of the five Crow Divinity Tribes outside of the golden shield.</p>
 <p>“He’s… he’s a Grand Dragoneer!!”</p>
 <p>“That dragon…. What kind of dragon is it? I’ve never seen a neo-demon like that before!!”</p>
 <p>“Even the ancestral shield was powerless. Mo Zi obviously forfeited, but still got killed!”</p>
 <p>Slowly, the eyes of all the Tribe members came to rest on Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The Greatfather of the Crow Scout Tribe stared in shock, panting. The Sky Priest quickly looked over at the Greatfather, who looked back. Both of them could see the astonishment in each other’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Both were thinking exactly the same thing: “Grand Dragoneer! He must have been injured in the past, and that’s why his neo-demon could only appear in illusory form. He’s currently incapable of summoning its true form!”</p>
 <p>They weren’t the only ones thinking along these lines. Apparently the Greatfathers and Priests from the other Tribes were all coming to the same conclusion.</p>
 <p>The Grand Elder of the Crow Scout Tribe took a deep breath as he looked at Meng Hao. No longer were his eyes filled with hostility and contempt. Instead, he now looked at Meng Hao as if he were looking at someone of similar status to himself.</p>
 <p>Wu Ling was panting, her face flushed with excitement and hands clenched into fists. She was once again reminded that Grandmaster Meng was the most powerful person she could rely on in her attempts to raise herself and Wu Chen to prominence within the Tribe.</p>
 <p>As for Wu Chen, his eyes were filled with zeal. In his eyes, Meng Hao wielded the might of the Heavens; there was no one whom he had esteemed more in his entire life.</p>
 <p>As for the man-form Outlander Beast, he stood there with wide eyes, muttering to himself.</p>
 <p>Everyone else had similar reactions. This was not to mention all of the people inside of the golden shield. Gu La took a deep breath, and his eyes filled with pain. At long last, he had resigned himself to his fate. A figure as powerful as Meng Hao was not someone who he could afford to provoke. There was really no other option than to just accept his lot. At the same time, he was actually somewhat happy.</p>
 <p>“The Young Master has grown even stronger. It seems following him won’t be such a bad choice.” His eyes turned to the side thoughtfully as he considered how to perform some meritorious deed that would propel him up from being little more than Meng Hao’s zookeeper.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment, when everyone was still in the throes of shock, that the old woman, the white-haired old man, and the Dragoneer dressed like a fisherman all made a move at the same time. Their neo-demons roared as they shot toward Meng Hao, who was now without his illusory Flying Rain-Dragon.</p>
 <p>Looks of greed could be seen in their eyes. As Dragoneers, they were able to read between the eyes; they knew that something was wrong with Meng Hao’s illusory dragon neo-demon. It couldn’t exist for very long before disappearing. If they could kill Meng Hao, then they would be able to seize the rest of his neo-demons.</p>
 <p>“He’s an injured Grand Dragoneer! He wields the might of a Grand Dragoneer, however… he is not like the true legendary Grand Dragoneers who are impossible to kill!”</p>
 <p>“To run into an injured Grand Dragoneer like this is actually good fortune for me!”</p>
 <p>The three people who attacked did so in unison, clearly having reached a common understanding. As for Gu La, he had only been a part of the five Crow Divinity Tribes for a short time. The other Dragoneer vassals were not very familiar with him, and therefore, did not include him in their decision.</p>
 <p>As they attacked, Meng Hao turned, cold, killing intent radiating from his eyes. He waved his right hand, causing the Eyeless Larva totem tattoo to spring into action. Strands of silk flew out to surround him.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao didn’t move at all as the attacking neo-demons from the other three Dragoneers screamed toward him.</p>
 <p>“Shameless!!” shouted Wu Ling furiously, her expression one of anxiety. The others from the Crow Scout Tribe looked completely indignant. The Greatfather and the Sky Priest, even the Grand Elder, all flew up in the air to go rescue Meng Hao. Unfortunately, they were immediately obstructed by the Greatfathers and Priests from the other Tribes.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, up on the platform, Gu La watched as all of this was happening. His face flickered, and without hesitation, he sent his neo-demon horde whistling through the air toward the other three Dragoneers.</p>
 <p>At this critical juncture, a massive roaring sound ripped out through the air from the direction of Meng Hao. The source of this sound was none other than the strands of silk from the Eyeless Larva, which spun rapidly through the air. Suddenly, they shot outward in all directions, slashing through the incoming neo-demons and turning them into a cloud of blood.</p>
 <p>Moments later, Meng Hao strolled out from within the sea of blood. Silk continued to spin around him as he looked coldly at the three who had just attacked him. As for them, their faces flickered and they began to step backward.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that the old woman’s eyes flickered with anger. Suddenly, the giant Cyclops Ape which she had held in reserve charged in attack toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Wild Giant?” said Meng Hao, his voice indifferent. Immediately, the Wild Giant roared and dashed forward. It directly picked up the giant Cyclops Ape and then viciously bit into the creature, sending blood spraying everywhere. As the Cyclops Ape screamed, the old woman’s face twisted. She was about to try to retreat when a white flash of light appeared. Suddenly, Big Hairy was standing behind her, his eyes cold and grim. Without hesitation, he savagely bit down onto the woman’s neck.</p>
 <p>She wanted to struggle, but then the Black Bat appeared. Its fangs sank into her, and she let out a bloodcurdling scream as her life force was sucked away. In the blink of an eye, she was turned into a withered corpse.</p>
 <p>Even as this was happening, the transcendent, white-haired old man atop the white crane shot toward the golden shield in an obvious attempt to flee the platform. As soon as he appeared outside, he looked back at Meng Hao, his face pale. He then let out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>Back atop the platform, Meng Hao ignored the man and began to walk toward the old fisherman. However, at the same time, he said, “Parrot?”</p>
 <p>Immediately, the large man who was standing among the Crow Scout Tribe members outside the shield let out a roar and charged toward the old man who had just emerged from the shield. The man’s cry of alarm turned into a miserable shriek as he was torn to pieces. As for the white crane, its cries were even more bloodcurdling.</p>
 <p>Back on the platform, the other weaker Dragoneers were all fleeing. The only ones who remained were Meng Hao, Gu La and the old fisherman.</p>
 <p>The old fisherman’s face was ashen and filled with astonishment as Meng Hao strode toward him. It was as if Meng Hao’s feet were trampling upon his heart and mind. He felt an increasingly intense pressure, and was well aware that he could not flee in this situation. He also knew that even if Meng Hao was an injured Grand Dragoneer, he still was not someone who could be provoked.</p>
 <p>However, the fisherman also knew that this was a critical life-or-death moment. The fight to survive lit his eyes. He waved his right hand, causing his enormous earthworm to let out a vicious shriek. At the same time, the countless earthworms within the magical silt suddenly flew up and attached themselves onto the giant earthworm. Now they were tentacles, making the giant earthworm look even more ferocious.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the old fisherman spit up a mouthful of blood and then began to perform an incantation with both hands.</p>
 <p>“Occult Karma Magic!” he cried. Immediately, the enormous earthworm lowered its head, opened its mouth and did something that came as a complete shock to all the onlookers…. It swallowed the old fisherman whole. After that, the top of the earthworm’s head began to bulge, and suddenly the face of the old fisherman appeared there.</p>
 <p>“I can’t hope to fight back against a Grand Dragoneer,” he cried. “But this Occult Karma Magic that I acquired years ago allows me to merge my body with a neo-demon and become a new life form! Even if you are a Grand Dragoneer, you can’t fight me now!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s expression flickered, and he immediately retreated, an expression of unprecedented seriousness filling his face. His Cultivation base was now in full rotation, and his eyes shone with a bright gleam. What he was looking at was, not the old man, but something else in up in the air!</p>
 <p>What had caught his attention was actually… the Occult Karma Magic!</p>
 <p>Within this Occult Magic, Meng Hao could sense the aura of the Ji Clan!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a gigantic vortex appeared up in the sky, within which a silver string appeared that looked very much like a fishing line. It shot down toward the old man who had merged with the earthworm. [1. This will surely cause some readers to recall a scene from <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-3-chapter-307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 307</a>]</p>
 <p>Instantly, everything went silent. Meng Hao noticed with astonishment that everything, including the Greatfathers, were all completely motionless. It was as if everything in the entire world had been frozen in place!!</p>
 <p>It was like everyone in the world had become fishes on the chopping block, just waiting for that fishing line to hook them and take them away.</p>
 <p>Apparently, he was the only person in the world capable of seeing this silver thread.</p>
