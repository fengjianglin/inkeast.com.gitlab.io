 <p><strong>Chapter 670: Crisis Approaches</strong></p>
 <p>Right in the middle of Seahold, Meng Hao unleashed his aura, causing the seven old men to scatter backward, blood spraying from their mouths. In that same moment, a jagged black cloud filled with crackling lightning flew through the air in the Fourth Ring, right outside of the Flying Immortal Sect.</p>
 <p>Then, the cloud dissipated to reveal an old man wearing a long black robe. His features were ancient, and the feeling of time seemed to circulate around him. He hovered in mid-air, looking down at the surface of the sea with an abstruse light glimmering in his eyes.</p>
 <p>If Meng Hao were here, he would recognize him immediately. This old man… was none other than the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch!</p>
 <p>“No more delays,” he said coolly. “This time… I’ll definitely wrest away his Dao foundation. If this clone gets defeated, then I’ll simply lock down on the location and come here with my true self via greater teleportation. Even if the Immortality Bestowal Dais does notice, I will achieve my aim!” A sharp gleam appeared in his eyes, which contained both determination and a desire to slaughter.</p>
 <p>“There are no traces of him whatsoever in the Fourth Ring. Before coming here, none of my auguries could produce any clue to his position. However, I was able to determine that he is still in the Milky Way Sea!</p>
 <p>“If he’s neither in the Fourth Ring, nor the Outer Sea, then that means he must be… in the Third Ring!</p>
 <p>“The Third Ring… is a forbidden zone for Dao Seeking….” He frowned, then suddenly flew directly down toward the Flying Immortal Sect.</p>
 <p>He remained inside for only the amount of time it takes an incense stick to burn. After he flew out, the entire Flying Immortal Sect suddenly burst into activity. Saint Flying Immortal had issued orders. More than half of the Flying Immortal Sect disciples flew toward the Flying Immortal Sect Sea City in the Third Ring.</p>
 <p>Tens of thousands of disciples soared through the air, each one of them clutching a jade slip that contained an image of Meng Hao, along with a bit of the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch’s Divine Sense.</p>
 <p>Even as the Flying Immortal Sect disciples entered the Flying Immortal Sect Sea City, checks were made of the Third Ring entrance records. However, no traces were found of Meng Hao. After that, the Flying Immortal Sect unleashed all the power it could muster, along with all of its ships, to begin to travel through the Stormwind Divide. They were on their way to the Third Ring to accomplish their task.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch was paying a visit to the Sea Divinity Sect. Although it was impossible to determine what exactly he promised them, when he left, Saint Sea Divinity issued orders that caused tens of thousands of Sea Divinity Sect disciples to spring into action. They transformed into countless sword auras that shot toward the Sea Divinity Sect Sea City, jade slips in hand. After a thorough check was made of the records of entry into the Third Ring, the tens of thousands of disciples began the process of entering the Third Ring, exactly as the Flying Immortal Sect disciples had.</p>
 <p>Even Saint Flying Immortal and Saint Sea Divinity, two Spirit Severing experts, joined the forces who left the Sect and entered the Stormwind Divide.</p>
 <p>Two of the three great Sects were driven into action by the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. However, because Saint Sun Soul of the Sun Soul Society was stationed in the three Sects’ Seahold in the Third Ring, it was impossible for an agreement to be reached. Therefore, although the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch was able to check their records, no forces were mobilized.</p>
 <p>After thinking about the matter for a moment, a gleam of insight appeared in the eyes of the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. “This kid is extremely cunning. However, the more I think about it, the fact that there are no records makes it even more likely that he’s in the Third Ring!”</p>
 <p>He left the Sun Soul Society’s headquarters and then entered the Stormwind Divide.</p>
 <p>“I’ve already flung out an inescapable dragnet into the Third Ring. I can’t believe that Meng Hao… will disappear under the noses of tens of thousands of disciples from two Sects!</p>
 <p>“Saint Flying Immortal and Saint Sea Divinity have already promised to go to the Third Ring. Their Cultivation bases are ordinary, but with their Sect’s legacy treasures in hand, they are forces not to be trifled with.</p>
 <p>“Nobody understands the Third Ring better than them. Meng Hao, if you can escape them, then I’ll admit your superiority.</p>
 <p>“It won’t just be them looking for you either. I’m confident that I can win over the Sun Soul Society. Then, a hundred thousand disciples from three different Sects will be looking for a single you…. And as if that weren’t enough, I’ve also posted a handsome bounty. When the time comes, all the Cultivators in the Third Ring will be my eyes and ears!</p>
 <p>If only one person tracks you down, then I will know!” The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch strode through the Stormwind Divide. Everywhere he went, the black mists spread away from him, opening a path. It was as if nothing dared to stand in his way.</p>
 <p>“This time, I must succeed. Too much time has passed, and the Ji Clan is growing suspicious….” The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch’s face was grim. How could he ever have suspected that a trifling member of the junior generation would turn out to be so troublesome, and even defeat him twice in a row?</p>
 <p>It was in the same moment that the tens of thousands of Flying Immortal Sect and Sea Divinity Sect disciples flew into the Stormwind Divide that, back in the Third Ring, in the Sun Soul Society’s Demon heart exchange pavilion in the three Sects’ Seahold, Meng Hao made a grasping motion that caused all of the Demon hearts to fly into his bag of holding.</p>
 <p>The seven old men were as mute as cicadas in winter. Their faces were pale, and they didn’t dare to do anything to hinder Meng Hao. The pain that filled their hearts had long since seeped out to completely inundate them.</p>
 <p>Panting, and eyes burning with passion, Sun Yunliang suddenly spoke up. “Senior, if you wish to exchange those Demon hearts, please rest at ease, the Sect will definitely give you a satisfactory price!” He knew that if he personally could handle the exchange, it would count as an incredible meritorious service to the Sect.</p>
 <p>Such meritorious service might even prompt a personal reaction from Saint Sun Soul, and could potentially affect his Cultivation base. He might even have a chance to enter the Spirit Severing stage!</p>
 <p>Even if he couldn’t, he would definitely become famous within the Sect.</p>
 <p>“Can your Sun Soul Society alone handle this many Demon hearts?” asked Meng Hao, looking at him.</p>
 <p>Sun Yunliang gaped for a moment, then made some calculations. His face looked a bit unsightly as he realized that even employing all the resources of the Sun Soul Society, it still might be a difficult task to exchange Spirit Stones for so many Demon hearts.</p>
 <p>In his moment of hesitation, a bright beam of light flew urgently toward the pavilion. It was Saint Sun Soul’s apprentice, who, with a flash of minor teleportation, appeared on the second floor. As soon as he arrived, he saw the seven ashen-faced old men. Then his gaze fell upon Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>All it took was one glance for him to ascertain that this was definitely the member of the senior generation to whom his Master had referred.</p>
 <p>The reaction was a type of intuition on his part. After a sharp intake of breath, the middle-aged man instantly clasped hands and bowed.</p>
 <p>“I am Han Feng of the junior generation. Greetings, senior. I come on orders from my Master to invite you to have a chat with him.”</p>
 <p>As soon as the man arrived, Sun Yunliang’s face flickered and he clasped hands in greetings. When the seven old men saw him, looks of awe appeared on their faces, and they also bowed.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked at the middle-aged man, and his eyes narrowed slightly. Then he turned his head to look at the tower that rose up in the middle of Seahold.</p>
 <p>“Your Master is Saint Sun Soul?” he asked coolly.</p>
 <p>“My Master is indeed Saint Sun Soul,” replied the man, his tone respectful.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked back at Sun Yunliang. “I’ll be with Saint Sun Soul,” he said. “You get the Spirit Stone situation sorted out and then come looking for me. How many Demon Hearts I give you will depend on how many Spirit Stones you can afford offer.” Saint Sun Soul’s apprentice gaped in response to Meng Hao’s words, and Wei Li stood there nervously.</p>
 <p>Sun Yunliang immediately sent a message. He didn’t provide specific details; he just related the information about how many Demon hearts Meng Hao had. The apprentice’s eyes went wide, and he gasped.</p>
 <p>Now he understood why his Master had sent him here.</p>
 <p>“How could he possibly have so many Demon hearts?” he thought. It was with even more reverence that he escorted Meng Hao as they flew off toward the tower.</p>
 <p>Wei Li was with them, and the closer they got to the tower, the more nervous she got. In the short period of time in which she had followed Meng Hao, she had seen more incredible things than she normally would have seen in her entire life.</p>
 <p>That was especially true of the scene that had just played out regarding the Demon hearts, which seemed as if it might cause her heart to stop beating entirely. She had known Meng Hao was rich, but could never have imagined… that he was THAT rich.</p>
 <p>Perhaps his wealth couldn’t compare to that of an entire country, but it was no exaggeration that it could rival a great Sect.</p>
 <p>Soon, the three of them reached the tower. Meng Hao turned to look back at Wei Li.</p>
 <p>The apprentice immediately clasped hands and bowed.</p>
 <p>“Senior, don’t worry. I, of the junior generation, will arrange accommodations for this Fellow Daoist.”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao nodded. Seeing that Wei Li did not object, he turned and flew directly toward the top level of the tower, vanishing in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>When he reappeared, he was inside the tower.</p>
 <p>Black-robed Saint Sun Soul sat cross-legged behind a wide table, his face expressionless. Next to him was the elegant and poised woman, his wife. She was sniffing a flagon of alcohol when Meng Hao appeared. She looked at him and smiled warmly.</p>
 <p>“You offered me some alcohol,” said Saint Sun Soul. “Now, I’d like to offer you some in return.” Even as he spoke, his wife brought the alcohol flagon over. She then produced two glasses, into which she distributed the alcohol. After that, she sat down next to Saint Sun Soul and looked over curiously at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao said nothing as he sat down directly across from Saint Sun Soul. He picked up the glass of alcohol, looked it over, then drank it in one mouthful.</p>
 <p>When the alcohol entered his mouth, it felt freezing cold, and made his entire body feel as if it were being frozen. It even seemed as if the alcohol were about to extinguish the flame of his life force.</p>
 <p>The coldness entered his Qi passageways and spread throughout his entire person. Even his Cultivation base was frozen in the blink of an eye. His Divine Sense slowed down, and he almost began to slip into slumber. It was even hard to think.</p>
 <p>He was so cold that frost appeared on his skin; it almost seemed like the alcohol in the cup could turn him into a statue of ice.</p>
 <p>This alcohol would most certainly kill any ordinary Spirit Severing Cultivator who drank it. However, Meng Hao’s fleshly body was far too powerful for that. Although his Cultivation base and Divine Sense had been frozen over, his fleshly body only vibrated slightly. In a short moment, thousands of these vibrations occurred. The frequency of the vibrations seemed to accord with some great Dao, and within the space of about ten breaths, white steam began to rise up from the top of his head. It filled the entire top level of the tower, and even caused the walls to make cracking sounds as they frosted over.</p>
 <p>A serious expression appeared in the eyes of the elegant woman, and although Saint Sun Soul’s face was expressionless, his eyes were cold as he stared at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Your alcohol isn’t very strong, at least, not as strong as mine.” Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding to produce, not another gourd bottle, but Han Shan’s bronze alcohol flagon. He also pulled out a glass which he then filled with alcohol and slid across to Saint Sun Soul.</p>
 <p>“Please, be my guest,” he said coolly.</p>
 <p>Saint Sun Soul’s face twitched as he looked down at the glass. He hesitated, which was something he rarely did.</p>
