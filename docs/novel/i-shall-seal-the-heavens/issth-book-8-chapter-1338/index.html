 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>The dot of light couldn’t illuminate every inch of the starry sky, and yet... as of this moment, it was visible to all cultivators from the First to the Seventh Mountains and Seas!</p>
 <p>In the Seventh Mountain and Sea, Planet Tiger Cage was in an uproar. It was the same in the First Mountain and Sea. There, Echelon cultivator Dao-Heaven stood in the midst of his army, looking up at the brilliant dot of light, and was completely shaken, as was everyone around him.</p>
 <p>From the First Mountain and Sea all the way to the Seventh, the cultivators were looking up at the brilliant dot of light as, all of a sudden, it erupted with even further brilliance!</p>
 <p>Massive rumbling sounds echoed out as the dot swelled in size by double!</p>
 <p>It was in that moment that the number of little suns surrounding Meng Hao increased from 4,000 to 8,000!!</p>
 <p>8,000 little suns, radiating intense light. Although that light couldn't match the light of a real sun, it was the most dazzling heavenly body visible!</p>
 <p>The cultivators were in an uproar, and the Outsiders were shaking inwardly as intense feelings of foreboding rose up inside of them.</p>
 <p>The Outsider Dao Sovereign who had split apart into numerous incarnations was shaking, and his eyes shone with astonishment as he stared at the light. The Outsider Imperial Lord who was fighting Ksitigarbha also felt his heart pounding.</p>
 <p>It was the same with the Outsider Paragon Eegoo.</p>
 <p>In sharp contrast, Ksitigarbha, Sea Dream, and the various Mountain and Sea Lords seemed to be suddenly inspired, and burst out with all the power they could muster to prevent any of their Outsider opponents from breaking free of the battle.</p>
 <p>Roars echoed out, and booms filled the air. When the number of little suns around Meng Hao increased to 8,000, the cultivators in the Eighth Mountain and Sea could finally see the sun up above!</p>
 <p>Cultivators and Outsiders alike felt as if the battle going on in the Eighth Mountain and Sea was like a giant millstone crushing down onto them. But then, the cultivators noticed that bright light, and their jaws dropped.</p>
 <p>“What’s that?”</p>
 <p>“How could there suddenly be a spot of light? Hold on... it’s rising up into the sky at incredible speed!”</p>
 <p>“Could it be some sort of magical item? It looks like it's heading toward… the 1st Heaven?”</p>
 <p>As the crowds burst out into a commotion, Meng Hao’s grandfather, the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea, suddenly shivered. He looked up, and when he saw that light, his eyes suddenly flickered in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Hao’er’s aura.... That's Hao’er....” He threw his head back and laughed uproariously at the sudden feeling of joy which swept through him. As he continued to watch the dot of light rising up, his eyes began to gleam with anticipation.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the number of little suns around Meng Hao once again increased dramatically. No longer were there 8,000. Instead, there were 10,000. The light of 10,000 little suns merged together as they rocketed toward the land mass up above. At long last... the light became clearly visible in the Ninth Mountain and Sea!</p>
 <p>Pill Demon saw it, and the members of the Fang Clan saw it. Meng Hao’s parents saw it, and his Grandma Meng and her people saw it. Fatty, Chen Fan, Fan Dong’er, Sun Hai, Fang Yu, and everyone else he knew... all cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea could see it.</p>
 <p>The flames of war burned just as hot in the Ninth Mountain and Sea as everywhere else, and the fighting was just as bloody and bitter. However, as soon as that light became visible, the people who were familiar with Meng Hao... could sense that it contained his aura!</p>
 <p>“That’s... that’s Meng Hao!!”</p>
 <p>“Heavens! How... how is this possible? Wait, how come looking at that light suddenly makes me think of Meng Hao?!”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that it’s really Meng Hao!?!?”</p>
 <p>The crowds were exploding into a huge commotion. On Planet South Heaven, Shui Dongliu stood atop that mountain peak, still looking up into the sky. Suddenly, he began to laugh, a laughter filled with happiness and anticipation.</p>
 <p>“It seems I picked well.... He who shall counter the tribulation... Meng Hao.” A warm expression could be seen on Shui Dongliu’s face as he continued to laugh, and stand there, waiting.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, all of the cultivators in all of the Nine Mountains and Seas were watching.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Meng Hao was drawing ever nearer to the land mass that was the 1st Heaven. He was now approaching the highest point in this region of space, and his speed caused rumbling to echo out as he closed in.</p>
 <p>His eyes burned with determination as he got closer and closer!</p>
 <p>However, even as he neared the 1st Heaven, the figures of a vast number of Outsiders suddenly appeared, flying out from it to meet him. In addition to that, numerous shields sprang up to protect the land mass.</p>
 <p>This land was the home of the Outsiders, so it went without saying that they would have protections in place for it. More and more Outsiders kept approaching, bent on stopping Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s lips twisted into a cold smile. Just when he was about to attack, he suddenly frowned. Simultaneously, the Outsiders who had just flown out suddenly fell back into retreat. That was because, all of a sudden, the explosive power of Dao Tribulation had appeared!</p>
 <p>This was Meng Hao’s Dao Tribulation, his fleshly body Dao Tribulation!</p>
 <p>The tribulation had appeared before but hadn’t fully descended. Instead, it had been hidden away, which as far as Meng Hao could tell was because the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm had helped him to get rid of it.</p>
 <p>But now, here it was again. That could only mean... that this was tribulation, not from the Mountain and Sea Realm, but instead, from the 1st Heaven!</p>
 <p>“It is its own world, with its own life forms,” Meng Hao murmured. “Naturally, the 1st Heaven has a will just like the Mountain and Sea Realm. Tribulation is caused by a disturbance in Karma. It saw the Tribulation Karma which was sown upon me, and therefore, took it upon itself to ensure that there was a reaping?” He understood, and yet wasn't afraid. Instead, he began to laugh.</p>
 <p>In his life, he had transcended Heavenly Tribulation on numerous occasions. Each one of those occasions had been of incredible difficulty, and yet now, he was completely confident that he could crush this instance of Heavenly Tribulation as easily as a dried out log!</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as Tribulation Clouds built up, massing together in front of Meng Hao. The rumbling of Tribulation Lightning could be heard as countless lightning bolts suddenly shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Virtually all of those lightning bolts appeared to be humanoid in shape, and filled with power that could destroy the Heavens and extinguish the Earth. As they closed in, they transformed into a sea of lightning that spread out wide in all directions, completely enveloping Meng Hao and his 10,000 suns. Down in the Nine Mountains and Seas, all of the cultivators could see what was happening.</p>
 <p>“Not good! The 1st Heavens is a complete world, with its own Tribulation power!!”</p>
 <p>“If that dot of light is Meng Hao, then he's going to be defeated....”</p>
 <p>“Dammit, could it be that the 1st Heaven is really impossible to fight!?” Cultivators were crying out in alarm all throughout the Nine Mountains and Seas. They were nervous, anxious, worried, and all of those feelings arose because of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Of course, there were some people in the crowd who looked on coldly. After all, all sorts of people existed within the Mountain and Sea Realm. Naturally, there were some who believed that once disaster struck, everyone would die!</p>
 <p>There were even some sects and clans who actually weren’t going all out in the fighting, but were instead hiding their true strength, looking for an opportunity to escape from the Mountain and Sea Realm. In fact, there were even some people who were secretly planning... to surrender to the 33 Heavens.</p>
 <p>However, those people were in the minority. The vast majority of the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm were unyielding. They had their dignity, and would never give in! Those cultivators were the ones who were nervously looking up into the starry sky.</p>
 <p>The Outsider Imperial Lord who was fighting Ksitigarbha suddenly began to chuckle with scorn.</p>
 <p>“Tribulation Karma has been sown, and yet he dares to try to trifle with our 1st Heaven? He’s definitely courting death!”</p>
 <p>Similar words were uttered by Paragon Eegoo to Paragon Sea Dream. The Outsider Dao Sovereign clones who were battling the Mountain and Sea Lords were the same. All of them were sighing in relief.</p>
 <p>Some people were anxious, some people were derisive. However, it was in that very moment that Meng Hao, facing the boundless Tribulation Lightning, suddenly raised his hand. Eyes gleaming, he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out.</p>
 <p>“Hex!”</p>
 <p>Eighth Demon Sealing Hex!</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as the power of his fleshly body exploded out. His cultivation base surged, and the Eighth Hex was unleashed, backed by the power of the Mountains and Seas. Instantly, everything began to shake violently. As Meng Hao waved his hand downward, all of the Tribulation Lightning in the starry sky suddenly stopped moving.</p>
 <p>Seventh Demon Sealing Hex!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao waved his finger again, this time unleashing Karmic Hexing, severing the Tribulation Lightning’s Karma, and then swishing his sleeve.</p>
 <p>Fifth Demon Sealing Hex!</p>
 <p>Inside-Outside Hex!</p>
 <p>Go back from whence you came!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao waved his sleeve, and instantly, all of the Tribulation Lightning swiveled, changing directions to shoot toward the very Tribulation Clouds they had emerged from, moving at a speed which defied imagination!</p>
 <p>Massive booms rang out as the countless Tribulation Clouds collapsed into pieces. It was a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering sight as the Tribulation Lightning bolts smashed into the clouds, completely and utterly pulverizing them!</p>
 <p>This sight provoked a collective gasp from cultivators and Outsiders alike. Eyes went wide and jaws dropped in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“What?!?!” exclaimed the Outsider Dao Sovereign incredulously.</p>
 <p>All of the Outsiders were completely and utterly shaken by Meng Hao. That bright spot of light was now nothing less than a complete nightmare for them!</p>
 <p>It was at this point that enraged howls could be heard from the land mass that was the 1st Heaven. More Tribulation Clouds roiled out, converging together into one gigantic cloud mass that seemed bent on completely eradicating Meng Hao!</p>
 <p>Massive pressure emanated out from the Tribulation Clouds, which surrounded Meng Hao and caused the starry sky to shake. As the enraged howling continued, it was possible to see an enormous claw taking shape inside of the Tribulation Cloud.</p>
 <p>That claw was pitch black and covered with scales, like the claw of a lizard!</p>
 <p>After all... this Tribulation was not from the Mountain and Sea Realm, but rather from the world of the 1st Heaven.</p>
 <p>The claw was covered with boundless Tribulation Lightning, the intensity of which vastly exceeded that from before. The claw shot toward Meng Hao, and as it did, more and more Tribulation Clouds converged in the area, causing the Tribulation to become even more majestic and boundless than before.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao's expression was the same as ever, and his eyes shone with a bright light. Without pausing for a moment, he shot toward the Tribulation Cloud and the lightning-covered claw. As he neared, he suddenly spoke in a voice which sounded like booming thunder.</p>
 <p>“Did I say you could converge here? Disperse!”</p>
 <p>Massive rumbling could be heard as the Second Demon Sealing Hex appeared. Real-Unreal Hexing erupted out toward the Tribulation Cloud, transforming what was real into what was unreal, and transforming the unreal to the real! All Meng Hao had to do was think!</p>
 <p>As of this moment, he changed the Tribulation, which was real, into something unreal. The converged Tribulation was instantly dispersed!</p>
