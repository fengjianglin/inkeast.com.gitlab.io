 <p><strong>Chapter 529: Seeking Death Repeatedly</strong></p>
 <p>Despite their caution, their end judgement was that even if this person had a high Cultivation base, they were seven in number, one of whom was of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, two were of the late Nascent Soul stage, and four were of the mid stage. Such a force could be referred to as ultimately powerful.</p>
 <p>If that weren’t the case, why else would Huyan Yunming send them to escort his only son in the outside world?</p>
 <p>Even still, all of them felt as if something were off, although they couldn’t place the reason.</p>
 <p>“Hey hey, so there’s someone out here meditating!” said Huyan Qing with a scornful laugh. He leaned up against the corpse of the woman as he looked out at Meng Hao. “Look up at me and tell me your name. Also, take out your bag of holding. Presumably, whatever precious treasure caused the Miracle Lightning will be on your person!”</p>
 <p>He couldn’t see Meng Hao’s Cultivation base, but in his entire life, he never actually looked at anyone’s Cultivation base. That was because he didn’t need to. It wasn’t necessary. His father was a Spirit Severing Patriarch. That was enough in and of itself.</p>
 <p>Throughout his life, it didn’t matter who he was dealing with, he never cared about that person’s Cultivation base. Because of the stage his father was in, anyone who dared to provoke him would end up dead in body and spirit.</p>
 <p>That point had been proven countless times. It also caused Huyan Qing to grow quite comfortable with such lofty arrogance.</p>
 <p>However, even as the words left his mouth, Sir Wu’s face flickered and his body quivered. He suddenly realized why he had such an odd feeling.</p>
 <p>“This young man… is sitting cross-legged on the Violet Sea itself!!”</p>
 <p>Sir Wu gasped, and his mind trembled. Earlier, he had felt something was off, but had overlooked the Violet Sea. Now, all of a sudden, he realized that this man was sitting directly on top of a thick aura of death. Even he himself feared touching the sea and would not continue to do so for any length of time.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the faces of the other six Nascent Soul Cultivators also fell. Their eyes went wide as they realized how fearsome and bizarre Meng Hao was.</p>
 <p>In the same moment in which the seven of them came to the same realization, Meng Hao’s eyes snapped open. He looked over the group of people, his gaze eventually coming to fall upon Huyan Qing.</p>
 <p>With the exception of Sir Wu, the seven Nascent Soul Cultivators all felt their minds shaking. Meng Hao’s gaze was like a stabbing sword that pierced into their minds and transformed into roaring.</p>
 <p>Even Sir Wu had a look of intense concentration.</p>
 <p>“The great circle of the Nascent Soul Stage!”</p>
 <p>“He’s of the great circle!” All of the other six Nascent Soul Cultivators had the same reaction when they realized the level of Meng Hao’s Cultivation base. Deep in their hearts they all breathed sighs of relief.</p>
 <p>The intrepidness of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage… was something that they didn’t fear. Sir Wu was also of the great circle. Furthermore, they were backed by the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe and Patriarch Huyan.</p>
 <p>As soon as Meng Hao’s gaze fell onto Huyan Qing, a roaring filled the man’s brain, and his body began to tremble. The wine cup in his hand dropped to the floor, spilling alcohol all over him in the process. The hand that had been stroking the corpse suddenly began to shake.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao retracted his gaze, ignoring the group. He coolly said one sentence: “What you’re looking for isn’t here. Go away.”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao had sensed this group long before they had arrived. Their goal in coming was clear, and the piercing gaze he had given them moments ago was merely a threat and a warning. Having finished speaking, Meng Hao closed his eyes again.</p>
 <p>Now that Meng Hao had retracted his gaze, Huyan Qing came to his senses. He took a deep breath, and after a final quiver, his eyes went wide and he glared hatefully at Meng Hao. “Such gall!!” he cried.</p>
 <p>Facing an intimidating threat like Meng Hao, some people would retreat to avoid any difficulties. Others, however, due to their background, would be unable to accept such a threat being levied against them. People like that, with low Cultivation bases but incredible arrogance and haughtiness, would only have their pride wounded.</p>
 <p>Huyan Qing was just such a person. The shame just now was fueling his anger. He could not accept being threatened to the extent that he actually felt fear. He was the only son of Patriarch Huyan. He was a noble Chosen of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. Virtually no one in the entire Black Lands would dare to provoke him. No matter where he went, he was a blazing sun that everyone respected.</p>
 <p>And yet here today, in this place, he had been threatened by the gaze of a Cultivator. Huyan Qing’s dignity had been threatened!</p>
 <p>From the time he was small until now, there had never been even one Cultivator who dared to act aggressively toward him. Meng Hao’s actions might seem normal to any other person, but to Huyan Qing, it was wild arrogance!</p>
 <p>For years, he had existed in a position far above others. No one had ever dared to level such a gaze against him, nor to cause his mind to tremble. In his mind, he had just been humiliated in a way that he couldn’t accept.</p>
 <p>“Kill him! Kill him for me this instant!” he roared, rising to his feet, his face twisted with rage as he glared at Meng Hao. “No one has ever dared to act in such a way in front of me. You’re DEAD!”</p>
 <p>Sir Wu’s face sank, and inwardly, he was cursing. He had known all along that Huyan Qing never thought things through, and on top of that, was arrogant and despotic. However, he had never imagined that he could possibly be this idiotic.</p>
 <p>There was really no good reason for Huyan Qing to make such a demand. Just now, this man had merely looked at them and then spoken some non-threatening words. Considering he was of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, his vague words were not out of the ordinary.</p>
 <p>Sir Wu was just about to speak up when, suddenly, the eyes of the four black-robed men near Huyan Qing suddenly filled with killing intent. Instantly, the men vanished. When they reappeared, they had Meng Hao surrounded. Within the hand of each black-robed man was a gleaming flying sword. Filled with killing intent, the men charged at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao sighed softly. He hadn’t desired to do any killing today. He was like a tree who wanted peace, except the wind wouldn’t stop blowing.</p>
 <p>“Well in that case, I guess you won’t be leaving,” said Meng Hao coolly. His eyes opened, although he completely ignoring the incoming flying swords.</p>
 <p>The moment his eyes opened, and indescribable killing intent rose up to the Heavens. It exploded out with shocking intensity, causing the clouds to churn and everything to dim. He was like some sort of primordial beast, climbing up out from the depths.</p>
 <p>The killing intent was thick, and invisible, but as it emanated out, the faces of the four black-robed instantly fell. They were vicious Cultivators who would kill without batting an eyelid. Over the years, they had killed many, many people. Normally speaking, they were cold and detached. However, facing such indescribable killing intent such as Meng Hao’s caused their faces to fall.</p>
 <p>Compared to Meng Hao, their tiny collections of killing intent were like fireflies, whereas Meng Hao… was the bright moon!</p>
 <p>What they didn’t know was that this was actually only ten percent of Meng Hao’s killing intent.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Four flying swords exploded into fragments that then transformed into ash. The bodies of the black-robed men began to shake, and then blood sprayed from their mouths. Their minds felt like paste, as if some massive power were crushing down onto them. They tumbled backward, but before they could fall back more than thirty meters, their heads suddenly exploded.</p>
 <p>Their mangled bodies fell down into the Violet Sea, sinking down beneath the waves, never to be seen again.</p>
 <p>A deathly silence filled the air. Huyan Qing’s eyes went wide and filled with disbelief. The seven Nascent Soul Cultivators’ faces were filled with unprecedentedly serious looks. Swishing sounds could be heard as six of them instantly moved to surround Huyan Qing. Sir Wu appeared in front of all of them, his face grim as he looked at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist,” said Sir Wu, clasping his hands, “we are from the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe of the Heavenly Court Alliance in the Black Lands. Everything before was a misunderstanding, Fellow Daoist. Please forgive us.”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked at him coldly, then looked at the people behind him. Having heard that they were from the Heavenly Court Alliance in the Black Lands, he suddenly thought of the Golden Crow Clan. He then slowly nodded his head. “Since it was just a misunderstanding, we can let the matter drop. Please take your leave posthaste.”</p>
 <p>Sir Wu heaved an inward sigh of relief. Even though he was of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, the pressure he felt pressing down from Meng Hao was incredible. He had no desire whatsoever to fight him.</p>
 <p>However, even as Sir Wu was about to clasp hands and fall back, Huyan Qing’s eyes suddenly filled with a savage light.</p>
 <p>“So, it turns out this guy puts on a strong front but is actually a weakling!” Huyan Qing had been incredibly shocked and even filled with fear when Meng Hao killed his four black-robed guards. However, seeing that he was willing to compromise after hearing that they were from the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, his heart filled with evil thoughts.</p>
 <p>“I said before to kill him!” he said, his voice grim. “All of you, get out there and kill him!” He laughed coldly. “Sir Wu, you promised my father that you would keep me safe during our journeys. You even promised to help me with my cultivation. This guy’s Cultivation base is obviously incredible, and I’ve taken a liking to it. Kill him for me, and before he dies, I’ll consume it!”</p>
 <p>His eyes radiated an intense light as he lifted his hand and held out a command medallion. “I order all of you. Kill him!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s expression never changed. He watched calmly as the scene unfolded. After the medallion appeared, the faces of Sir Wu and the six other old men instantly fell. Moments later, four of the group performed minor teleportations as they approached him. They figured that it didn’t matter that they weren’t a match for Meng Hao. All they had to do was pin him down. The person to do the actual killing would naturally be Sir Wu.</p>
 <p>“Oh well,” sighed Sir Wu. “I guess this guy is just unlucky!” Clenching his teeth, he turned toward Meng Hao. Suddenly, his great circle Nascent Soul Cultivation base exploded with power.</p>
 <p>“You’re dead!!” Huyan Qing began to laugh maniacally.</p>
 <p>As the four mid Nascent Soul Cultivators neared, Meng Hao’s eyes glittered with the desire to kill. The killing intent that exploded out from him this time was thirty percent! His voice cool, he said, “Looking to die?”</p>
 <p>The killing intent roared out, causing the faces of the four mid Nascent Soul stage old men to fill with astonishment. Suddenly, Meng Hao vanished like a ghost. When he reappeared, he was behind one of the mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivators. His expression was cool, and his hair whipped about as he lifted up his right hand and tapped the man.</p>
 <p>Death aura and life force mingled, transforming into a fearsome power of extermination. The Nascent Soul Cultivator was absolutely powerless to resist, and instantly exploded.</p>
