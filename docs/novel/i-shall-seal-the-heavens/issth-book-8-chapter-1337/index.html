 <p><strong>Chapter 1337: Destination: First Heaven!</strong></p>
 <p>Meng Hao was a blur that shot from the Fourth Mountain and Sea up into the starry sky, toward the land mass that was the 1st Heaven. Not a single regret could be found in his heart. He was completely determined, maddened, enlivened with the idea of enacting the rise of the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>He was attempting to do something that could shake Heaven and Earth!</p>
 <p>He was attempting to destroy the 1st Heaven, the home of the invaders. He was attempting to set the blood of the Mountain and Sea Realm aboil. All of the cultivators locked in battle would be able to look up and see... the destruction of the 1st Heaven!</p>
 <p>Some people might think that an act like that would have little meaning, and couldn't compare to Meng Hao slaughtering Outsiders on the field of battle using his cultivation base. However, the truth of the matter was that this plan... was utterly and profoundly meaningful.</p>
 <p>Currently, the people of the Mountain and Sea Realm were in the midst of despair. After having been suppressed for tens upon tens of thousands of years, they had then been invaded. They had long since lost the dignity they had once had during the days of the Paragon Immortal Realm. In that age, its cultivators had been valiant, but when complete and utter catastrophe struck, it was as if their Dao hearts had been shattered. After the initial catastrophe, they were then completely sealed by the 33 Heavens, stifling any recovery that their Dao hearts might have experienced.</p>
 <p>After two such mighty blows, their valiance waned, and they didn't dare to take the fight to their enemy....</p>
 <p>For a people to rise up, their spirits needed to be kindled. And it was the same when the time came for a homeland to ascend.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao knew that he was only one person. Even if he became a Paragon, the course of such a monumental war was something he couldn’t change on his own. He needed to stir the minds and hearts of the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm. He needed to awaken within them... the valiance that had once existed in the Paragon Immortal Realm!</p>
 <p>Back in those days, there had been a saying. “Any who assault the Immortal World will be put to death!”</p>
 <p>When Meng Hao destroyed the 1st Heaven, similar words would once again be heard in the Mountain and Sea Realm. “Any who assault the Mountains and Seas will be put to death!”</p>
 <p>The Mountain and Sea Realm was on the brink of annihilation. Looming directly behind them was a bottomless chasm. There was nowhere to retreat to.That meant that the only thing to do now was rise to prominence!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes shone with a bright light. His mind, his thoughts, his cultivation base, everything about him was completely focused. He was like a shooting star, like a flaming torch, like a brilliantly shining lamp!</p>
 <p>He was a lamp that did not seek to illuminate the starry sky of the Mountain and Sea Realm, but rather... sought to kindle the spirits of the cultivators therein!</p>
 <p>Kindle a fire that would exist forever and never be extinguished!</p>
 <p>He rose higher and higher, flew faster and faster. He was a beam of light, scintillating brilliantly, the center of all attention! The first people to notice him were the cultivators of the Fourth Mountain and Sea.</p>
 <p>They stared blankly at Meng Hao as he rose up, and at first, no one was really sure what he was doing. However, as he picked up speed, the people down below realized that he was heading... not toward the starry sky itself, but toward the spot where the starry sky ended, toward that which weighed down upon the hearts and minds of all Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators.</p>
 <p>The 1st Heaven!</p>
 <p>“What... what is he doing...?”</p>
 <p>“He’s heading toward the 1st Heaven!!”</p>
 <p>“This... this....” Gasps could be heard from within the huge army of the Fourth Mountain and Sea. Every moment, more and more cultivators’ faces flickered with astonishment and shock.</p>
 <p>Xu Qing stood atop the altar, trembling, her head tilted up to look at Meng Hao climbing up into the sky, charging toward the Heavens. A strange flicker could be seen in her eyes, which slowly turned into a bright glow. Although she was worried, she suddenly felt an incredible sense of pride.</p>
 <p>This was the love of her life. Her man!</p>
 <p>The forces of the Fourth Mountain and Sea were soon in a complete uproar.</p>
 <p>“He's heading for the 1st Heaven!!”</p>
 <p>"He’s going up to... destroy the 1st Heaven!!”</p>
 <p>“But... can he do it?”</p>
 <p>Equally shaken were the Outsiders, who stared blankly at Meng Hao, almost unable to believe what they were seeing.</p>
 <p>Also in the Fourth Mountain and Sea were Ksitigarbha and the Outsider Imperial Lord, who were fighting fiercely, causing rumbling booms to echo out. Ksitigarbha’s eyes suddenly began to shine brightly as he realized what Meng Hao had in mind.</p>
 <p>The Outsider Imperial Lord gaped, and his face flickered.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Paragon Sea Dream was fighting with the Outsider Paragon Eegoo. They also noticed what Meng Hao was doing; Paragon Sea Dream’s face broke out into a wide smile, and Paragon Eegoo’s face fell.</p>
 <p>At this point, Meng Hao reached such an incredible speed that he was like an arrow, backed by Mountain and Sea power to shoot rapidly toward the 1st Heaven.</p>
 <p>However, only the cultivators of the Fourth Mountain and Sea could see him. He was currently too far away from the other Mountains and Seas for anyone there to spot him. However, as he flew along, his eyes glinted, and he suddenly waved his right hand. Suddenly, a ball of light flew out. This was none other than his own Supernova Magic, which immediately began to suck in all the light around it, and thus grow even brighter. [1. Meng Hao created the Supernova Magic in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-6-chapter-942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 942</a>. He used it in battle a few subsequent times, notably when fighting Guru Heavencloud in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-7-chapter-1159/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 1159</a> and when fighting the giant in the Divine Flame world in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-7-chapter-1179/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 1179</a>]</p>
 <p>He wanted all of the cultivators in the entire Mountain and Sea Realm to witness what he was doing.</p>
 <p>One little sun was not enough, so he waved his hand, and dozens of little suns appeared. There were more than a hundred of them swirling around, shining with increasingly scintillating light.</p>
 <p>“Still not enough!” Meng Hao growled. As he continued to shoot toward the 1st Heaven, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture, then waved his hands out in front of him, causing more little suns to appear.</p>
 <p>100, 300, 500, and soon, Meng Hao was surrounded by 1,000 little suns!</p>
 <p>1,000 little suns, absorbing Heaven and Earth, sucking in all the light of the starry sky. They rapidly grew larger and more dazzling, until Meng Hao himself actually looked like a sun!</p>
 <p>Majestic light shone out, to the point where the cultivators of the Third and Fifth Mountains and Seas could look up into the sky and see a new sun!</p>
 <p>The cultivators in the Third Mountain and Sea were in the midst of fighting the Outsiders, and yet everyone looked up in shock.</p>
 <p>“What’s that...?”</p>
 <p>“A sun? That’s not possible. But it really does look like an actual sun or moon....”</p>
 <p>At the same time, cultivators in the Fifth Mountain and Sea looked up and gasped in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Wait, no.... there’s a person inside!!”</p>
 <p>“Impossible!”</p>
 <p>The Outsiders were equally taken aback.</p>
 <p>Up in the starry sky, down beneath the 1st Heaven, Meng Hao was surrounded by 1,000 spheres of light. His expression was one of unswerving determination as he came to the conclusion that 1,000 little suns wasn’t enough. He needed more. He threw his head back and roared, pushing onward with greater speed and yet simultaneously waving his hand, causing another 1,000 little suns to appear!</p>
 <p>2,000 little suns were shining radiantly. They were now densely packed together, each one of them emanating blinding light. However, from a distance away, the light of those 2,000 small suns merged together... to make them look like the glow of one enormous sun!</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the 2,000 little suns swirled around Meng Hao. He flew higher and higher, away from the Mountain and Sea Realm, growing ever closer to the 1st Heaven. Soon, the cultivators in the Second and Sixth Mountains and Seas could see the brightly shining sun up above.</p>
 <p>Although it currently looked like little more than a dot of light, within the pitch blackness, it was extremely conspicuous!</p>
 <p>In the Second Mountain and Sea, the cultivators and Outsiders were fighting a particularly bloody battle, and the reek of gore had permeated the entire Mountain and Sea. The vast army of cultivators had suffered setback after setback, and the roars of the Outsiders filled the entire starry sky above them.</p>
 <p>However, even as despair wrought at the hearts of the cultivators, in the moment when they had no hope, and were bitterly convinced that they were going to lose the battle, all of a sudden, a bright dot of light appeared up above. That light became the only thing the cultivators of the Second Mountain and Sea looked at.</p>
 <p>“That’s...”</p>
 <p>“That dot of light. Heavens! Considering how far away we are, that dot of light must actually be enormous!”</p>
 <p>“What's going on...?” The cultivators of the Second Mountain and Sea were completely abuzz!</p>
 <p>Although they couldn't actually see Meng Hao, somehow they could all sense that within that light was someone emanating an incredible willpower, and utter determination!</p>
 <p>The Sixth Mountain and Sea was equally in an uproar.</p>
 <p>“That light is heading in the direction of... the 1st Heaven!!”</p>
 <p>“Considering how far it is away, the fact that we can see it moving up means that its true speed... must be mind-boggling!!”</p>
 <p>Although the Lord of the Sixth Mountain and Sea had been killed, the violet-robed Lord Wu of the Fifth Mountain and Sea was now fighting in the battle, and at long last, the cultivators were able to launch successful counter-attacks against the Outsiders.</p>
 <p>Lord Wu was the first one to look up into the starry sky. His jaw dropped, and he instantly began to tremble.</p>
 <p>“It's him.... He’s going... to destroy the 1st Heaven?” His eyes began to shine, and suddenly a surge of indescribable excitement rose up within him.</p>
 <p>Soon the other cultivators of the Sixth Mountain and Sea caught sight of the light up above, and they were completely shaken. Although not everyone could immediately discern where that dot of light was heading, people quickly began to deduce the truth.</p>
 <p>“He’s heading toward the 1st Heaven?”</p>
 <p>Even as the cultivators in the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Mountains and Seas were staring fixedly at the dot of light, it suddenly grew twice as bright as before!!</p>
 <p>Along with the eruption of brightness, the light also grew in size. That was because the number of little suns surrounding Meng Hao had increased from 2,000 to 4,000!</p>
 <p>“There’s a person inside that light!!” By now, virtually all of the experts in the great Mountains and Seas were able to discern what was happening. Their hoarse exclamations were heard by those around them, and soon everyone's minds were spinning.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that the cultivators in even further Mountains and Seas could see that high up above the Nine Mountains and Seas, there in the starry sky... was a sun!</p>
 <p>Although it wasn’t the true sun, by now, everyone could see it....</p>
 <p>A sun above the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>In the Seventh Mountain and Sea, Yuwen Jian suddenly opened his eyes. He had been sitting there in meditation, but when he heard the exclamations ringing out, he looked up into the sky and then suddenly felt as if he were being struck by lightning.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t quite see who it was inside that light, but… his intuition told him exactly who it was! “It's Meng Hao. It's definitely him! He’s going to lift the spirits of an entire people by destroying the 1st Heaven!!”</p>
 <p>Shaking, he shot to his feet, panting excitedly, eyes burning with anticipation.</p>
