 <p><strong>Chapter 425: The Severing Cannot Continue!</strong></p>
 <p>Out on the Milky Way Sea floated an island. If you looked at the island from up above in the sky, it had the appearance of a turtle. This island had been quite a mystery in the Milky Way Sea during past years. It floated about here and there, surrounded by mists.</p>
 <p>Suddenly the floating island stopped, and an astonishing bellow of rage could be heard from within.</p>
 <p>“SCREW OFF!! Bastard! I just fell asleep, and now you come bothering me? You think I want those memories of that twerp Meng Hao? Dammit! SCREW OFF!!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Reliance’s thunderous voice echoed out, kicking up huge waves on the Milky Way Sea.</p>
 <p>The archaic voice anxiously said, “How could something like that even exist!?!? How do I accomplish this severing? How?!?!”</p>
 <p>He sounded completely flustered and exasperated, shaking because of Meng Hao’s very existence. On another island in the Milky Way Sea was a stooped old man who was currently standing in front of an artist’s easel, painting a picture of the tall, strapping man who stood in front of him.</p>
 <p>In the middle of making a brushstroke, the old man suddenly frowned and looked up into the sky. A profound glow suddenly appeared.</p>
 <p>“People who exist in my memory cannot have their Karma severed by the Heavens of Ji,” he said softly. He lifted his right hand into the air and then waved his paintbrush. A drop of ink flew out which then merged into the air.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the entire sky in the region turned completely black.</p>
 <p>A miserable shriek could be heard echoing out from the void. The voice was none other than that of ancient Ji Nineteen.</p>
 <p>As the shriek filled the air, all of the Cultivators who were affected by the destruction of the Karma threads suddenly shook. The threads connecting them to Meng Hao, suddenly began to recover. They returned from absolute destruction to form once again. In fact, because they were being reformed out of destruction, they were even stronger and more tenacious than before.</p>
 <p>Chu Yuyan’s face was pale white. Her closed eyes opened, and she looked silently at the character ‘Meng’ written on the wall. She slowly lifted her hand up and wrote the character ‘Hao.’</p>
 <p>Pill Demon put away the medicinal pill and looked wordlessly off into the distance. However, his eyes were filled with staunchness and determination.</p>
 <p>Fatty rubbed his head as he thought confusedly about past events. Suddenly, his body trembled and he gasped. There were now many more memories of the past. His face flickered as he recalled Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Chen Fan was the same, as was the entirety of the lands of the Southern Domain. In the Black Lands and the Western Desert, all of the Cultivators whose Karma threads had been affected, were suddenly recovered.</p>
 <p>Xu Qing gnawed at her lip silently. She looked at the pill bottle in her hand, and her eyes filled with deep anxiety. She now remembered everything that had happened, and was filled with coldness. She could only imagine the loneliness she would experience if Meng Hao’s image did not exist within her memories.</p>
 <p>Within her silence, she clenched her teeth. She knew that power was the only way to truly resolve problems. She was now more determined than ever to fully fuse with the memories of Matriarch Phoenix, and increase the level of her Cultivation base.</p>
 <p>Back in the Western Desert, in the Crow Divinity Holy Land, within the depths of the volcano, Meng Hao stood trembling in the Pool of Destiny. He, too, heard the miserable shriek. As it echoed about, he opened his eyes to see the silver fishing line turning black. The blackness spread, and as it did, the line turned into smoke and ashes. The ash and smoke spread out amidst the shriek.</p>
 <p>The sound of the shriek caused Meng Hao’s eyes to glow with coldness. He hadn’t been able to see what had happened just now, but he had witnessed the severing of the Karma of the old earthworm man. He could only imagine the death he had just experienced.</p>
 <p>Killing intent radiated out from his eyes as he caught sight of an indistinct figure in front of him. It was the image of a Cultivator surrounded by black flames, screaming as he struggled to disappear from this place.</p>
 <p>The indistinct figure was repeatedly calling out a name. “Shui Dongliu, it’s Shui Dongliu….”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes glittered. His left hand raised up and placed the blood-colored mask onto his face. Massive, frenzied power exploded from his Cultivation base. Blood Qi emanated out in waves as he charged forward.</p>
 <p>Blood Finger. Blood Palm. Blood Death World!</p>
 <p>They all appeared, causing massive roaring to fill the air as they descended upon the illusory figure. Meng Hao’s killing intent soared as he waved his hand again. The Lotus Sword Formation appeared; as it rotated, the power of Time rippled out.</p>
 <p>“DIE!” shouted Meng Hao, his voice ice cold. His hand flickered an incantation and he pointed forward.</p>
 <p>The Violet Qi Guillotine, Violet Qi Garrote, Violet Gibbous Moon exploded out with a roar, causing violet light to billow up.</p>
 <p>“Without a face, a single word, the flames of war unify!” Meng Hao lifted up his left hand and pressed down onto the mask. Immediately, a gigantic face appeared. It opened its mouth and spoke a voiceless word. A roaring sound filled the air as it shot toward the illusory figure.</p>
 <p>As the miserable screaming continued, Meng Hao charged forward, slipping on the Fang Clan glove. He punched, and a massive rumbling could be heard. Meng Hao’s killing intent soared as he punched over and over again, more than a hundred times.</p>
 <p>Each of these fists contained incredible power. Rumbling sounded out without end, and the illusory figure seemed to be on the verge of bursting into pieces. It appeared to have been sealed, rendering it incapable of making any moves whatsoever; even its Cultivation base was weak beyond compare. It was still trying to disappear and escape, but Meng Hao performed another incantation, and the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex appeared.</p>
 <p>As the figure suddenly stopped moving, Meng Hao’s face distorted with the desire to kill. None of his magical arts seemed to have any effect on this figure. And yet, Meng Hao was not willing to let him escape.</p>
 <p>He had killed one of the sons of Ji, and he wasn’t afraid to kill this Ji Nineteen. That was especially true considering that if he didn’t kill him right now, when he was at his weakest, then the man would no doubt cause endless troubles in the future.</p>
 <p>Gritting his teeth, Meng Hao pressed down again onto the blood-colored mask.</p>
 <p>“Flag of three streamers!” he growled. This was the most powerful magical item he possessed!</p>
 <p>Considering the current level of his Cultivation base, he could, with effort, wield one streamer. This time, it didn’t appear in illusory form, either. As soon as the words left his mouth, power filled the area as a long, blood-colored streamer appeared. As soon as it left Meng Hao’s hand, Heaven and Earth shook. It shot forward, wrapping around the figure of Ji Nineteen, dragging him.</p>
 <p>Ji Nineteen let out a horrified scream filled with shock, fear, and disbelief.</p>
 <p>“This… this is… the Mountain and Sea Emperor’s Banner!” He cried out in alarm as roaring shook his body. Suddenly, what had been illusory, only partly in the same world as Meng Hao, was now forcibly dragged out. There, standing directly in front of Meng Hao, was an old man.</p>
 <p>He was clearly in very sore straits; his face was covered with a burning, black ink, and his aura was in absolute chaos. Currently, it seemed he was being forcibly repressed, and was now only able to wield the power of Core Formation.</p>
 <p>His face was filled with astonishment. He could scarcely believe that he had actually been pulled into this world.</p>
 <p>“Impossible! It can’t be the Emperor’s Banner. The legendary Emperor’s Banner was destroyed….”</p>
 <p>“What Emperor’s Banner, b*tch!?” said Meng Hao, his face contorted with fury as he thought about how he had just basically died. Then he recalled what Shui Dongliu had said years ago, that people he remembered could not have their Karma severed by the Ji Clan. He was certain that without Shui Dongliu, he would most likely be dead.</p>
 <p>In his fury, he unthinkingly imitated the parrot’s wording. With that, he clenched his hand into a fist and punched. A boom filled the air, and the old man let out a cry.</p>
 <p>“You trifling mortal, do you dare to injure me? You….”</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>“Do you dare to kill me!?!?”</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao struck out repeatedly with his incredibly powerful fist, pummelling the old man until his body was on the verge of exploding. However, the man’s Cultivation base was fundamentally intrepid. Despite being attacked in such a way, his body was recovering rapidly.</p>
 <p>“Puny mortal, you injured me and dragged me out from the world of Ji. But just wait until I’m fully recovered. I’ll kill you with my bare hands!”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with coldness, and retracted his right hand. He glared coldly at the old man, which caused the old man to stare in shock. Then, the old man began to laugh coldly.</p>
 <p>The instant he began to laugh, however, Meng Hao’s right hand flickered an incantation and then he pushed down onto the old man’s forehead.</p>
 <p>“It would be a pity to kill you. However, your blood, along with the blood of that son of Ji that I killed, can help me to create my Blood Spirit!”</p>
 <p>“My recovery will quickly outpace whatever tiny injuries you inflict on me,” said the old man, his tone vicious. Suddenly, Meng Hao waved his hand, and the Lotus Sword Formation appeared. Rippling power of Time flowed out, relentlessly pounding against the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man’s face fell, but he let out a cold snort nonetheless.</p>
 <p>“If it were twice as powerful, maybe it could affect me. But that level of Time power is simply not enough!”</p>
 <p>“Not enough?” asked Meng Hao, his eyes flickering icily. He instantly produced his four wooden swords and stabbed them into the man’s body to hinder his recovery.</p>
 <p>The old man was inherently tyrannical and haughty, but the instant he saw the four wooden swords, and especially when they stabbed into him, he had no choice but to scream miserably.</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Dammit! Those are… Immortal Murdering Swords!! You, you, you… just who are you?! How can you have so many!! Although they’re not completely unsealed… they really are Immortal Murdering Swords!!” His injuries suddenly worsened, and his recovery slowed down to a crawl. Thanks to Meng Hao’s many forms of torment, Ji Nineteen was in an incredibly wretched predicament.</p>
 <p>“There’s still more time to cause you suffering!” said Meng Hao, coldness flickering within his gaze.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile….</p>
 <p>In the Great Tang in the Eastern Lands exists a luxurious mansion. Sitting inside was the girl with the explosive temper that Meng Hao had met that year, Fang Yu. She was currently wiping some blood off of her mouth; how could Ji Nineteen ever have imagined that the effects of his Karmic Severing would reach all the way to the Great Tang in the Eastern Lands, and Fang Yu? [1. Meng Hao met Fang Yu in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-3-chapter-309/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 309</a>, in the events leading up to the end of book 3. She initially attacked him, but backed off after seeing the mark on his hand, whereupon she threw an epic temper tantrum]</p>
 <p>Fang Yu’s face filled with fury, and she rose to her feet. She was about to walk out the door when suddenly a woman’s voice could be heard, shocking and furious to the extreme. It came from the restricted area in the back of the mansion.</p>
 <p>“JI CLAN!!”</p>
 <p>When she heard the voice, Fang Yu’s face flickered. She saw someone flying out from the restricted area toward her. It was an elegantly dressed middle-aged woman. Her face was beautiful, but grim. As soon as she appeared, everything grew dim, and the air itself began to vibrate. The land quaked, and cracks appeared on the surfaces of the nearby buildings, despite the restrictive spells that protected them.</p>
 <p>“Mom….” said Fang Yu, trembling. She feared no one in the world more than she did her mother.</p>
 <p>“You, come with me!” said the woman. This woman was none other than the woman who had appeared in the Song Clan back in the Southern Domain. Her eyes radiated killing intent as she turned toward the Ji Clan mansion which existed in the Great Tang of the Eastern Lands. [2. This woman appeared in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-2-chapter-190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 190</a> as well as subsequent chapters. It was in <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-2-chapter-193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 193</a> that the guy from the Song Clan speculated that she was actually the mother of the Resurrection Lily.]</p>
 <p>“Mom, don’t do anything rash. Dad said before that….”</p>
 <p>“Don’t talk to me about your dad. Are you coming or not?!” The woman’s phoenix-like eyes radiated intense killing intent.</p>
