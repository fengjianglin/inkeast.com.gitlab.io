 <p><strong>Chapter 1146: What Makes You Think I’ll Give Them To You!?</strong></p>
 <p>The supreme World Essence was a pillar of light that shot up from the rubble of the central temple to slam into the huge net up above, causing increasingly intense ripples to spread out.</p>
 <p>Of the ten chains spreading out from the pillar of light, nine had completely bound the Echelon cultivators inside of them, who let out bloodcurdling screams. The other cultivators from the Mountain and Sea Realm looked on with expressions of shock. Massive waves of astonishment surged through their hearts, and they scarcely dared to believe their eyes.</p>
 <p>These were Echelon cultivators, blazing suns of the Mountain and Sea Realm. Any one of them occupied a position far above Chosen, and you could even say that they were Lords of their generation. Eventually, they would grow into the future leaders of the entire Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>They were so powerful that they could fight with cultivators of the Senior generation. Even the weakest of their number could look down arrogantly at all Heaven and Earth, and that wasn’t even to mention the stunning forerunners like Meng Hao and Dao-Heaven.</p>
 <p>But now... they were chained up, even Dao-Heaven, who trembled and screamed. He had no desire to cry out, and yet couldn’t stop himself. He had gained enlightenment of 3,000 great Daos, and now he was experiencing something that felt like Soulsearching. A massive suction force was being exerted on his mind, absorbing him through the chain to feed the World Essence’s pillar of light.</p>
 <p>However, there were a total of ten chains stretching out from the pillar of light, which meant that there was still one final chain which hadn’t latched onto anything, as if it couldn’t find its target.</p>
 <p>The Emperor was laughing maniacally; his legs had exploded, and he had already lost his arm. Blood flowed out of his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. However, it was at this point that, all of a sudden, an intense light suddenly began to shine out from his forehead: the glow of an Echelon mark!</p>
 <p>In the moment that the Echelon mark appeared, the final chain sped through the air like a snake to wrap around him.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, he was the final person to be absorbed!</p>
 <p>His face twisted as incredible pain surged through his body. However, he didn't scream; instead, he just continued to laugh uproariously, laughter filled with obsession and madness. All the surrounding onlookers were completely shocked.</p>
 <p>Only Zong Wuya seemed unmoved, and stood there silent and taciturn. He looked up into the void, at the huge net that seemed to be on the verge of being pierced through by the World Essence light.</p>
 <p>By this point, the lands of the Windswept Realm were only 3,000 meters away from the net!!</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the void as the figures behind the huge net looked on with glittering eyes. Even at this point, they still weren’t ready to make any rash decisions. They continued to watch the fierce battle taking place between Paragon Sea Dream and the Windswept Imperial Lord. No matter how they analyzed it, it truly appeared as if neither party was holding back. Paragon Sea Dream was clearly weak, and still had not recovered from her old injuries. Despite that... the watching figures still hadn’t emerged from behind the net to attack.</p>
 <p>Caution. That was what these rebels from the 33 Heavens had come to view as the driving principle they would stick to after having sacrificed countless amounts of shed blood to gain their freedom!</p>
 <p>The figures behind the huge net looked on as the Windswept Realm’s World Essence light continued to absorb power from the ten Echelon cultivators, which included the Emperor. As a result, the pillar of light began to glow with even more scintillating brightness. At the same time, a huge black hole began to form within the giant net!</p>
 <p>That black hole was like a vortex that spun endlessly and crackled with numerous bolts of lightning. Rumbling sounds filled the air as a teleportation portal formed!</p>
 <p>Dao-Heaven was shaking, his screams growing more intense. It was the same with everyone else, including the souls of Hai Dongqing, Hong Bin, and the other Echelon cultivator. Those three should have died already, but the Emperor had used the power of the Windswept Realm to somehow capture and collect their souls.</p>
 <p>A boom could be heard as Hai Dongqing was the first to give out. His soul exploded into bits of ash, all of which were sucked up into the chain, which then retracted back inside the pillar of light. The light grew even more intense, and the rumbling black hole in the giant net grew larger.</p>
 <p>The next to go was the Echelon cultivator from the Second Mountain. After that was Hong Bin. Both souls exploded and faded away, after which the chains that had bound them retracted into the pillar of light. As more time went by, the other Echelon cultivators were gradually losing their ability to endure.</p>
 <p>Blood oozed out of Dao-Heaven’s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Lin Cong and Han Qinglei were incredibly withered, as was Yuwen Jian. The worst off was the young Echelon cultivator from the Fifth Mountain. His previously pudgy frame was now little more than a sack of bones. He was trembling violently, and his eyes were blank, as if his soul had already been sucked away.</p>
 <p>A moment later, a boom could be heard as he exploded. There was no bloody mist that could be re-formed. He was completely dead, his life gone and sucked away by the chain.</p>
 <p>With the death of each Echelon cultivator, the Daos of the Windswept Realm which they had acquired were absorbed by the pillar of light. When none of those 3,000 great Daos were left, then the result would be what happened starting with Hai Dongqing: complete and utter death!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao had a vicious expression on his face. The power of the chain was not as terrifying to him as it was to the others. In fact, he was the one exception among the Echelon cultivators, the only one who wasn’t screaming!</p>
 <p>And yet, his Essences and life force were still being absorbed!</p>
 <p>2,999 Essences!</p>
 <p>2,998 Essences!</p>
 <p>2,997 Essences!</p>
 <p>The chain sucked away his understanding of the 3,000 great Daos, but it wasn’t an easy task. It could only suck away one Dao at a time, the reason being... that everyone else had gotten their Daos with the help of the Emperor's Windswept Realm qi flow. However, his came with the help of the Echelon Heart. Because of the Echelon Heart, it was as if he himself was the qi flow, and had taken its place!</p>
 <p>Although his earliest World Seal had come with a blessing of the Windswept Realm’s qi flow, at that time... the Windswept Realm hadn’t been fundamentally changed, and was still operating as normal!</p>
 <p>Therefore, Meng Hao had essentially not taken much, if any, of the Emperor’s bait. If he had taken some in, it was only during his acquisition of the final 300 great Daos. And even so, it had been accomplished on his own, and not with the assistance of the Emperor’s qi flow.</p>
 <p>And that was what gave him a chance to free himself from the chain!</p>
 <p>Yuwen Jian was in the same situation. Although his screams were real, the chain was clearly not absorbing him in the same way that it was with the others.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked up, his expression fierce. “I gained enlightenment of these Daos myself! What makes you think I’ll give them to you!?”</p>
 <p>Then he threw his head back and roared. His body trembled as his cultivation base exploded with power, his own power, which he used to fight against the chain and the World Essence light.</p>
 <p>“What’s mine is mine, and definitely not yours!” he roared, and rumbling sounds filled his body. The chain erupted with brilliant light, and all of a sudden, it seemed that Meng Hao might be able to break free.</p>
 <p>The other cultivators from the Mountain and Sea Realm gasped in response. Also watching were the figures in the void beyond the huge net, especially the giant three-headed six-armed figure, whose eyes shone with intense killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps these 3,000 great Daos are part of the Windswept Realm, but... in the moment I gained enlightenment of them, they fused into my heart. They... are my Daos!” Intense vibrations wracked his body, and cracking sounds could be heard as the chain shook. As of this point, it seemed incapable of absorbing anything from Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Not only could it not absorb anything from him, what it had already absorbed suddenly began to flow backward and merge back into him! Meng Hao began to glow with azure light, in completely awe-inspiring fashion.</p>
 <p>2,995 Essences!</p>
 <p>2,996!</p>
 <p>2,997!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao roared as boundless azure light shone off of him, a representation of the power of an Allheaven Immortal. Power erupted off of him, causing Heaven and Earth to shake violently. From the look of it, the chain was just about to break!</p>
 <p>This development caused Zong Wuya to inhale sharply; the Emperor was also shaking, and he turned his sightless eyes in Meng Hao’s direction. Although he wasn’t extremely shocked, his expression was extremely dark. He suddenly looked up at the figures out in the void, and began to chuckle bitterly.</p>
 <p>“At this point, you people... still don’t trust me?!</p>
 <p>“The sole World Essence has been unleashed, all you need to do is activate the teleportation portal, and the Windswept Realm... can join you, and leave the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>“We’ve already done everything that we can do. Our 3,000 great Daos have been utilized, our only World Essence has become a pillar of light! We’ve sacrificed the Echelon cultivators, and coalesced the willpower of all living things here. How come... you just won’t trust us!? What do we have to do to get you to trust us?!?!”</p>
 <p>In response to the Emperor’s voice, the figures behind the black hole in the huge net looked on silently. Various conflicted expressions could be seen on their faces; some were hesitant, and some were smiling coldly.</p>
 <p>Even if the black hole had appeared, and even if the teleportation portal had opened, if they weren’t willing... the Windswept Realm could not ascend!</p>
 <p>Unless they were completely and absolutely convinced, it didn’t matter that Paragon Sea Dream was weak; they still weren't willing to make a move, and wouldn't dare to activate the teleportation portal.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately... they didn’t want the Windswept Realm!</p>
 <p>By this point, azure light swirled thick around Meng Hao. The chain was vibrating rapidly as he rapidly regained all of his 3,000 great Daos.</p>
 <p>2,998 Essences!</p>
 <p>2,999 Essences!</p>
 <p>3,000 Essences!</p>
 <p>In that moment, he raised both hands into the air and stretched them apart. Massive, shocking rumbling sounds echoed out as the chain suddenly collapsed into pieces and exploded!</p>
 <p>As the pieces faded away, Meng Hao took a step forward, completely freeing himself from the absorbing power of the World Essence light!</p>
 <p>Without the slightest hesitation, he shot toward Yuwen Jian, extended his right hand, and then grabbed onto the chain that was binding him.</p>
 <p>“Break!”</p>
 <p>BOOM!!</p>
 <p>The chain shook for a moment as if it were about to collapse. Yuwen Jian excitedly rotated his cultivation base, joining forces with Meng Hao. The two worked together and, moments later, the entire chain shattered!!</p>
 <p>“Many thanks to you, Meng Hao!!” Yuwen Jian said, voice filled with joy. Even as he spoke, Meng Hao was speeding toward Dao-Heaven.</p>
 <p>“Don’t thank me. Come on, let’s save everyone!” At this critical juncture, Meng Hao’s choice was not to simply sit around and let the other Echelon cultivators die. He planned to save them!</p>
 <p>“Save everyone?” Yuwen Jian asked, staring in shock.</p>
