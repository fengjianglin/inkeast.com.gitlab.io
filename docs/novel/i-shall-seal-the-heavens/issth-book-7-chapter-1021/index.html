 <p><strong>Chapter 1021: Pursued into the Ruins of Immortality!</strong></p>
 <p>Meng Hao waved his finger at Patriarch Reliance, causing him to suddenly stop. By this point, the turtle’s discontent had reached the point of detonation, and he let out a mighty roar at Meng Hao. As for Meng Hao, he rose to his feet and looked curiously off into the distance toward the Ruins of Immortality.</p>
 <p>“Strange. I got a really weird feeling just now,” he said. Although he wasn't sure what had caused it, he was sure that moments ago, something like a veil had passed in front of his eyes. It was as if... there was something he should have seen that had been covered up.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean strange?” said Patriarch Reliance, sounding a bit arrogant. “A girl went by just now, calling your name. You ignored her, and she ran off into the Ruins of Immortality. Oh, there was some kid chasing her, looked like he was trying to kill her.” Patriarch Reliance looked both disdainful and pleased with himself as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao stared in shock.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, that's right!” the parrot said, sounding surprised. “Lord Fifth saw it too. You mean you didn't see it?”</p>
 <p>“Lord Third saw it too!” the meat jelly said, sounding very serious. “You really couldn't see it!? Come on, stop faking. Faking is immoral. Faking is wrong!”</p>
 <p>“I saw it too....” said Guyiding Tri-Rain, covering a smile with her hand.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes glittered as he looked off into the starry sky. He glanced over at the Ruins of Immortality, muttering to himself.</p>
 <p>“Oh right,” continued Patriarch Reliance. “Meng Hao, you little bastard, listen up. That kid just now said something like... since you didn't want to marry the girl, he was going to help fulfill your husbandly duties for you. You know, kids these days seem really kindhearted, the type who really finds joy in helping others.” He laughed loudly, seeming very pleased with himself.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, that’s right! Lord Third also happens to think that kid is really kindhearted! What a good person! There aren’t many sincere people like that in the world. Such character and such morals are really worth imitating!” The meat jelly nodded its head vigorously, clearly ignorant of the reality of the situation....</p>
 <p>The parrot rolled its eyes and then cleared its throat.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao, if you don’t go save her right now, she’ll truly become the plaything of that other guy. If Lord Fifth remembers correctly, that furless girl is named Li Ling’er.”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao's face was now extremely unsightly as he stared off into the Ruins of Immortality, and his eyes flickered with killing intent. He wasn't sure why Li Ling’er wasn't back in the Li Clan, but it didn't matter. Regardless of what issues the two of them had, he had no reason to leave her to die when he was in a position to save her.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, since her pursuer had mentioned something about fulfilling Meng Hao's husbandly duties, well, that was something that no true man would be able to accept.</p>
 <p>The matter of he and Li Ling’er getting married was a personal matter between the two of them. For someone to say something like that was an outrageous provocation.</p>
 <p>Glaring at the parrot and meat jelly, he gave a cold harrumph, then lifted his foot and then stamped it down onto Patriarch Reliance.</p>
 <p>“Alright... follow them into the Ruins of Immortality!” he said, his voice cold but his heart filled with vigilance. He knew that whatever technique had been used to obscure his vision had been something completely terrifying. What was even more frightening was the fact that Li Ling’er was being hunted, and yet the Li Clan hadn't sent anyone to rescue her. However... Meng Hao glanced at Patriarch Reliance and thought about how he had been unaffected when everyone else on Planet East Victory had been knocked senseless. That showed how unbelievably powerful he must be in battle.</p>
 <p>Feeling excited, Patriarch Reliance changed directions and headed toward the Ruins of Immortality at top speed. The parrot was also getting excited. It had the feeling that Ruins of Immortality were filled with all sorts of furred and feathered beasts, which made it like the promised land of his dreams.</p>
 <p>As for the moronic meat jelly, it was easily convinced of anything in its simple-mindedness.</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the air as Patriarch Reliance exploded with speed. In the blink of an eye, he was already in the Ruins of Immortality, speeding in pursuit of Li Ling’er.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Reliance was gargantuan, so as soon as he entered the Ruins of Immortality, everything began to tremble. It was as if the natural laws had been disturbed by his arrival, and were now changing.</p>
 <p>Guyiding Tri-Rain trembled, and her expression suddenly turned blank. For some reason, she suddenly felt like something was calling her, summoning her... to a place deep within the Ruins of Immortality.</p>
 <p>It was almost as if there were a forgotten portion of her memories that were suddenly unlocked as soon as she entered.</p>
 <p>As soon as the small group entered the Ruins of Immortality, the old man sitting in the ship outside of the ruins frowned.</p>
 <p>“It seems I underestimated that turtle... as well as that bird. I even underestimated that bell-like thing, and the girl on top of the turtle.” Earlier, he had recognized that Patriarch Reliance and the parrot were powerful, but now he had to admit that they were far more terrifying than he had assumed.</p>
 <p>“For them to be able to see through my Daoist magic....” he muttered. It was something that completely exceeded what he had planned for. Originally, his surface plan had been to appear as if he was warning Yi Fazi, and yet surreptitiously provoke him into accosting Li Ling'er.</p>
 <p>Through the death of Li Ling’er, the Zheng Clan of the Spiritstar Realm would sow a seed with Meng Hao. The old man had very much been looking forward to seeing what type of flower would bloom as a result.</p>
 <p>But now, things were not going according to plan.</p>
 <p>Muttering to himself, he looked over at the Ruins of Immortality, and he seemed to be recalling something that filled him with deep fear.</p>
 <p>“The Paragon Immortal Realm of yesteryear....” he thought. Memories swirled within him, and he sighed. Finally, he gritted his teeth and headed into the Ruins of Immortality. He had no choice. He could plot against the Zheng Clan, but he definitely could not allow Yi Fazi to die in the Ruins of Immortality.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao stood on Patriarch Reliance’s head, looking around as they sped through the Ruins of Immortality. This was his second time coming here, and things in this area looked much different than the entrance opened by the Three Great Daoist Societies.</p>
 <p>The Three Great Daoist Societies’ entrance was an area that they had thoroughly explored, and they had taken steps to ensure that it was not dangerous. However, the current area Meng Hao was in was a place few people ever came to.</p>
 <p>Up ahead, numerous stone fragments hung in the air. There were also shattered statues visible, and the sky was covered with fissures that seemed capable of slicing up and swallowing anything and everything.</p>
 <p>There were even strange, Demonic voices that echoed about in the air, along with an archaic, ancient aura.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, these were only the outskirts of the Ruins of Immortality. As they proceeded onward, Patriarch Reliance’s expression grew more serious. However, he still seemed to charge forward with incredible power, blasting through any obstructions as if they were dried sticks.</p>
 <p>The strength of his fleshly body had reached a terrifying degree, allowing them to speed rapidly through the outer region of the Ruins of Immortality.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s expression was grim as he rotated his cultivation base. 123 Immortal meridians exploded with power, none of which seeped out of him. 33 blurry Heavens descended, and the glitter of starlight appeared in his eyes. As he stood there, energy surging, he truly seemed to exude the will of the Immortal Realm Paragon.</p>
 <p>“I don't want the same thing that happened before to happen again, where you people can see what’s happening and I can’t!” he suddenly announced coldly. He lifted his hand, and a Fifth Hex rift appeared.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Reliance muttered something to himself, then suddenly opened his mouth and roared. The roar did not spread out in all directions, but rather, was confined to the rather small area around him.</p>
 <p>“OPEN!”</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as everything around Meng Hao suddenly changed. He saw floating spatters of blood and other traces that someone was being viciously hunted down!</p>
 <p>In a location not too far away, Li Ling’er’s face was pale white, and blood sprayed from her mouth. She was like an oil lamp on the verge of sputtering out, her life force at its limit. She had found no hope in the Ruins of Immortality, only despair, causing her to laugh bitterly.</p>
 <p>Yi Fazi and his black, three-headed python were right behind her. Everything trembled as a brutal aura spread out in all directions, causing ripples to surge out and push the nearby debris away.</p>
 <p>“Feeling hopeless, are we...?” asked Yi Fazi, laughing. His eyes gleamed with an evil light as he raised his right hand.</p>
 <p>With the wave a finger, he caused a black beam to shoot out. Everywhere it passed, rocks and canyons shattered into pieces!</p>
 <p>A boom could be heard, and blood sprayed out of Li Ling’er’s mouth as she slammed down into a field of shattered rocks. She looked back, glaring at Yi Fazi without the slightest hint of defeat or compliance in her eyes.</p>
 <p>She might be in a hopeless situation, and she might be about to die, but she would perish with her dignity.</p>
 <p>“I love this kind of expression!” exclaimed Yi Fazi. “Back home, all the trophy heads of the Immortals killed by the Patriarchs throughout history have this exact same expression!</p>
 <p>“Immortals....” He threw his head back and laughed, and his expression was one of boundless arrogance.</p>
 <p>“Immortals must all die, and all Immortal Realms will be destroyed. Who gives a crap about the Paragon Immortal Realm and you crappy Immortals!” Killing intent flickering, Yi Fazi advanced toward Li Ling’er.</p>
 <p>He waved his right hand in a claw-like gesture, causing an enormous power to explode out. Li Ling’er was simply incapable of fighting back or struggling. Her eyes, however, shone with determination, as an aura of extermination suddenly surged up inside her.</p>
 <p>She had chosen to self-detonate!</p>
 <p>“Self-detonation?” said Yi Fazi with a light smile. He quickly performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, unleashing some type of Daoist magic that caused Li Ling’er to tremble. Suddenly, the destructive aura within her dispersed. She was shocked to find that... she couldn't self-detonate!</p>
 <p>“I learned this secret magic a long time ago to deal with Immortals who try to self-detonate,” Even as he spoke, Yi Fazi appeared in front of Li Ling’er, lifted his right hand up, and clutched her by the neck. Then, he shoved her down onto the ground. His expression vile, he smiled and said, “Alright, be a good girl and allow me to consummate our marriage. After that... I’ll use your blood for my baptism.”</p>
 <p>Li Ling’er was trembling, and she bit her lip as she stared back at Yi Fazi. It was at this point that suddenly, she opened her mouth, causing a brilliant light to shoot out.</p>
 <p>Yi Fazi was shocked; at the same time, glittering light suddenly rose up around him. The beam of light flashed past his neck. It was a dangerously sharp willow leaf that had come dangerously close to slitting his throat.</p>
 <p>“Slut!” he roared. Inwardly, he was shocked. Without the life-saving shield provided by his clan, that willow leaf would most likely have taken his head off.</p>
 <p>Enraged, he was just about to reach in and rip Li Ling’er's tongue out when, all of a sudden, a coldness caused him to look up and off into the distance. What he saw was Patriarch Reliance’s massive frame rushing toward him, atop whom stood Meng Hao, staring coldly in his direction.</p>
