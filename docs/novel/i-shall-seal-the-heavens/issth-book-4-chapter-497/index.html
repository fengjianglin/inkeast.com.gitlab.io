 <p><strong>Chapter 497: Devil Weapon!</strong></p>
 <p>The spear stabbed into the altar was roughly ten meters long!</p>
 <p>Its name was Lonelytomb!</p>
 <p>Demon Weapon Lonelytomb!</p>
 <p>Refined from blood by the Third Generation Demon Sealer, it was impossible to say how many Cultivators and how many ancient Demons had been transformed into a sea of blood by this spear!</p>
 <p>The length of ordinary spears could not compare to the length of this spear. It was completely pale white, as if it were constructed from bones. There were no decorative patterns on its surface, no magical symbols. The only thing that could be seen were faint marks that looked like blood vessels, making its appearance very bizarre.</p>
 <p>An indescribable aura emanated out from the long spear, shaking Heaven and Earth. It caused the mist in the world of the vortex to tremble. The aura emanated out from the vortex in to the Western Desert.</p>
 <p>Amidst the rumbling drone, the spear did not move. It seemed as though it could not leave the world of the vortex. However a beam of pale white light shot out from it, as fast as lightning. In the blink of an eye, it shot out from within the world of the vortex.</p>
 <p>In that instant, the black-robed man’s face fell. His body trembled violently as countless faces burrowed out from within him. All of these faces wore unprecedented expressions of awe and terror.</p>
 <p>Countless screeches could be heard, rising up into the sky.</p>
 <p>The pale white light neared with indescribable speed, piercing through the black hand that was shooting toward Meng Hao. In that instant, the shocking, powerful hand of black mist acted as if it had just been slammed into by fire. It dissolved in an instant, causing the countless black faces within to screech, their expressions that of terror and unprecedented hopelessness.</p>
 <p>In life, they had been killed by this spear. After death, they had congealed into a Devil Construct, but were still in complete fear of the spear.</p>
 <p>Having been killed by the spear, they would never be reincarnated. All generations were imprisoned inside it. There was not a more fearsome punishment that could be inflicted upon them!</p>
 <p>A boom echoed out as the huge mist hand was pierced and destroyed by the beam of pale white light. After, the pale white light shot over toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s mind was filled with roaring. Moments ago, his body had been on the verge of exploding with Alcohol Qi. His last bit of Dancing Sword Qi had been fermenting for some time, a trump card which exceeded the life-saving power of the Agarwood!</p>
 <p>However, there was no need for him to do a thing. The pale white light appeared, Demon Weapon Lonelytomb personified. Heaven and Earth shook with rumbling roars!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked at the beam of white light in front of him and felt a powerful calling. The calling felt familiar as it filled his mind. He was calling this spear, and the spear was calling him!</p>
 <p>With this sudden appearance of good fortune, Meng Hao was now thinking clearly. He lifted his hand up and took hold of the pale white light. Instantly, it transformed into an illusory, but extremely realistic… pale white spear!</p>
 <p>As he gripped the pale white Lonelytomb, a rumbling suddenly filled his mind.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of which generation Demon Sealer you are,” said an archaic voice. “I am Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, refined from blood by the Third Generation Demon Sealer, sealed in the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane. My will sleeps, and thus, the Devil Construct was born….</p>
 <p>“The Devil Construct is also me. As for my life, from the moment I was forged, it was determined that I would have a total of nine Masters. From the First Generation Demon Sealer to the Ninth, these were to be my Masters!</p>
 <p>“Whichever generation you are, come to the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane. I’m waiting for you here…. The Third Generation Demon Sealer completed his ancient Dao and broke through the Nine Mountains and Seas. However, in that moment, he was buried in the starry sky. As for his death… there are clues that have been left behind that relate to a shocking secret. His legacy is here with me…. I can’t hold on for very long. You… must come here!</p>
 <p>“At the moment, I am only capable of sending out this small bit of my life will. In a moment, I will return to my slumber and conserve my will. I will wait for you or other Demon Sealers to come. Exalted Demon Sealer, grasp my life will, recite the ancient Demon Sealing Scripture, and subdue this Demon Construct.</p>
 <p>“It will be… your way of communicating with me in the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane! If you are unable to come to the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane in this life, then pass this spear down as a legacy, all the way to the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer!</p>
 <p>“Before the Third Generation Demon Sealer died, he said… that the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, if he is not killed, will be the pinnacle! He will have the chance to defy the Heavens and change fate, he will be the last ray of hope for the great Nine Mountains and Seas!” The voice sounded weak as it echoed out in his mind. Within his bag of holding, the Demon Sealing Jade began to shudder, as if it could feel the death of the Third Generation Demon Sealer. A sense of grief suddenly emanated out from it.</p>
 <p>As the sound faded away from Meng Hao’s mind, he slowly looked up.</p>
 <p>“I… am the Ninth Generation.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke the words, his eyes shone with a strange light as he looked over at the black-robed man, who was retreating in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Ancient Dao; Tenacious Desire to Seal the Heavens; Benefaction for All in the Mountains; Dao Tribulation Must Come to the Nine Mountains and Seas….” He spoke the words slowly, and as he did, he raised up the pale white spear. A white glow surged out of it which stabbed toward the black-robed man.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s voice was filled with strange power. Others could not sense it or hear it, but to the black-robed man, or even Patriarch Reliance, it was like a magical curse!</p>
 <p>The black-robed man let out a miserable shriek as his body began to collapse into pieces. Black mist spread out in all directions.</p>
 <p>He raised his head and let out a mad howl toward the sky.</p>
 <p>“Shut up! Shut up! Stop reciting it!!” he cried. His eyes were bright red as he shot toward Meng Hao in an attempt to kill him. However, before he could even get within three hundred meters of Meng Hao, he let out a horrible shriek, and his body rapidly began to dissipate.</p>
 <p>He was struck through and through with fear and astonishment. He suddenly turned to flee off into the distance, no longer harboring any thoughts of killing Meng Hao. The only thought that was in his mind was the same thought that rose up in the mind of Patriarch Reliance that year. He must flee, and never lay eyes on Meng Hao again.</p>
 <p>“…. My Fate is the Aeon!” Meng Hao completed reciting the ancient Demon Sealing Scripture almost in the same moment that the man made to flee. As he spoke the final words, the black-robed man let out a miserable shriek, filled with complete mournfulness. His body continued to collapse. He was so weak that he couldn’t evade now. His eyes filled with shock and desperation, and he completely lost control of himself. It was as if an enormous, irresistible gravitational force had sprung into being from the long spear in Meng Hao’s hand. The black-robed man could not stop himself from being pulled relentlessly toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“You damnable League of Demon Sealers! The Nine Mountains and Seas cannot tolerate you! You all deserve to meet horrible deaths!”</p>
 <p>As the man shrieked, Meng Hao looked at him with ice-cold eyes. Then, he slowly began to recite the second verse of the Demon Sealing Scripture.</p>
 <p>“Ancient Dao; Study Demons of Myriad Variations; Tread not the Path of Immortals; Face the Tribulation of the Nine Mountains and Seas….”</p>
 <p>Even more black mist poured out from the black-robed man’s body. His miserable shrieks sounded out as he tumbled toward Meng Hao, completely unable to control his movements. There were now 3,000 meters between the two of them.</p>
 <p>2,500. 2,000. 1,500….</p>
 <p>The black-robed man howled as his body collapsed more. Suddenly, massive amounts of faces could be seen within his body. Each of the faces was filled with savagery and also fear as the emanated out and attempted to pull the man’s body away.</p>
 <p>“… My Dao is Eternal; The Masses Have Erred but My Dao is True….”</p>
 <p>The words echoed out like words from the Heavens. When they reached the black-robed man, the faces around him shrieked and twisted, as if they were about to be blotted out. The black-robed man was pulled closer.</p>
 <p>1,200 meters. 1,000 meters…. 300 meters!!</p>
 <p>The black-robed man was thoroughly mad, filled with a sense of deadly crisis. He roared, causing the tens of thousands of Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators in the area to begin to tremble. Suddenly, the totems on the bodies of over a thousand of them suddenly began to suck away at their life force. In the blink of an eye, they were transformed into withered, dried up corpses. Their totems flew out, transforming into blood-colored faces that shot toward the black-robed man.</p>
 <p>More and more Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators were affected in this way. Popping sounds filled the air along with bloodcurdling screams. In the blink of an eye, more than ten thousand Cultivators died miserable deaths as they were transformed into desiccated corpses.</p>
 <p>Their life forces, their very lives themselves, were sucked dry by the totems, which then flew out toward the black-robed man. They circulated around him, transforming into a power that resisted the force which was pulling him toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Exalted Sacred Ancient….” The remaining five Nascent Soul Cultivators of the Eight Branch Alliance all wore expressions of grief. They could sense the totems in their bodies sucking away at their life force. The saw their fellow Tribe members dying. In the space of just a few breaths, more than ten thousand Tribe members became dried up corpses.</p>
 <p>This feeling of grief, the feeling caused by a Sacred Ancient exterminating its own Tribe, caused the foundation of the entire Eight Branch Alliance to collapse.</p>
 <p>What was happening completely exceeded the imaginations of the other Cultivators who were watching on. That was especially true when it came to the black-robed man. His mighty existence caused them to feel as if they were suffocating. However, despite his incredible power, he had been forced down into his current situation. All of a sudden, these tribes felt complete astonishment regarding the owner of the Demon Spirit, Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Rumbling filled the air. By this point, more than ninety percent of the Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators were dead. Massive amounts of their totems circulated around the black-robed man, causing his body to suddenly have the power to resist, and stop moving.</p>
 <p>Just as the black-robed man was heaving a sigh of relief, and gathering his power to make a final attempt to flee, Meng Hao’s eyes glittered with killing intent and he uttered the final part of the second line of the Demon Sealing Scripture.</p>
 <p>“… My Fate is the Aeon!”</p>
 <p>Something like a thunderclap exploded out within the black-robed man. It transformed into a bloodcurdling scream. The faces surrounding him all began to collapse. His body flew through the air like a shooting star.</p>
 <p>300 meters. 150 meters. 30 meters…. In the blink of an eye, the black-robed Devil Construct let out a roar of despair as its body slammed into the pale white spear. He was turned completely into a black mist which was then absorbed into the spear.</p>
 <p>The color of the pale white spear began to change. Soon, it was completely black. Furthermore, it was no longer illusory, but real!</p>
 <p>As of now, it was no longer Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, but rather, a Devil Weapon!</p>
 <p>Sealing marks with the power to obliterate will exploded out within the spear. The black-robed man’s will was erased. This Devil Construct was now not a construct. Only a Devil was left behind!</p>
 <p>As Meng Hao hefted the spear, a rumbling sound filled the area. A black wind suddenly kicked up, causing his hair to whip about. His green robe now looked completely black because of the black wind.</p>
 <p>With the Devil Spear in hand, the black wind transformed into a black mist that spread out in all directions. Within the mist could be seen thousands upon thousands of faces, twisted with pain and roaring out. They were fearsome, but also filled with an unprecedented awe of Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Whoever held the spear would have control of the countless vengeful ghosts of those slain by Lonelytomb!</p>
