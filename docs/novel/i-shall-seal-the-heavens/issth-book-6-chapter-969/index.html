 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>The Tribulation Clouds were enormous, and to anyone else in the Immortal Realm, the pressure they exuded would be incomprehensible. However, Meng Hao already had eight Immortal meridians, Immortal meridians that were simply incomparable to normal Immortal meridians.</p>
 <p>In addition, he had his true Immortal fleshly body!</p>
 <p>His level of preparation going into this Immortal Tribulation was unheard of, and made him preeminently qualified to face it.</p>
 <p>When you added in his Eternal stratum, it made it so that when he looked at the enormous descending hand, a crazy idea suddenly sprang up in his mind.</p>
 <p>Immortal Tribulation... had always been a situation in which the cultivator almost passively transcended the tribulation by madly avoiding or rushing past the Tribulation Lightning and then ramming open the Door of Immortality amidst the hail of lightning.</p>
 <p>Everyone had used similar methods. Pill Demon, Fan Dong’er, and Fang Wei had done things in such a manner, as had all of the other Chosen who had recently stepped into true Immortality.</p>
 <p>Upon opening the Door of Immortality, Immortal light would pour out, and the Tribulation Clouds would dissipate.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, Meng Hao’s face filled with a wild look as his idea developed. A vicious aura rose up, transforming into a domineering air as he looked at the gigantic hand, and then punched out.</p>
 <p>“I will walk the path of true Immortality! If the Heavens approve, so be it! If they don't approve, too bad! That is my domineering path to Immortality! Therefore, I should handle things... in an unprecedentedly domineering way!</p>
 <p>“For me, it’s Immortality or death!”He threw his head back and let out a long cry as he shot like a meteor toward the huge hand. When they slammed into each other, booms echoed out in all directions. The air shattered, and the huge hand collapsed. Blood sprayed from Meng Hao's mouth, and his hair was thrown into disarray. However, his Eternal stratum surged, and then, blood-colored light swirled around him, forming a bloody mist which quickly transformed into an enormous Blood Demon head.</p>
 <p>It flashed as it shot toward the tribulation Cloud and the endless bolts of lightning up above. In Blood Demon head form, Meng Hao slammed into the Tribulation Clouds, causing booms to echo out in all directions. Yet again, a massive rift opened up.</p>
 <p>However, the Tribulation Clouds churned, and quickly began to repair themselves. And yet... the result of this constant cycle of destruction and repair was that the amount of Tribulation Clouds up in the starry sky was reduced!</p>
 <p>The Tribulation Clouds were not infinite and without number. As Meng Hao destroyed them, their numbers lessened; apparently, if someone attacked them continuously, then the shocking Tribulation Clouds... would eventually completely dissipate.</p>
 <p>Something like that had never, ever occurred before throughout all the years!</p>
 <p>However, that didn’t mean... that it couldn’t happen!</p>
 <p>The crazy idea that Meng Hao had just come up with was that if the Tribulation Clouds wanted to block his way... Then he would bash them into nothing! He would destroy them completely!</p>
 <p>THAT was domineering!</p>
 <p>That was the way to do things! When you entered true Immortality, the only option was to make a huge scene!</p>
 <p>The Blood Demon head collapsed, and Meng Hao hovered there in mid-air, surrounded by booming lightning. Every bolt of it caused him to tremble, and yet, his true Immortal fleshly body was able to withstand it easily. His Eternal stratum continuously healed him, and his eyes shone with obsession. His cultivation base surged, and his Dharma Idol launched endless attacks against the Tribulation Clouds.</p>
 <p>One punch! Another! And another!</p>
 <p>Colors flashed in the sky, and the lightning surrounding Meng Hao appeared to be boundless. From time to time, blood sprayed from his mouth as he was flayed over and over. However, he didn’t hesitate for a moment as he charged forward and attacked yet again.</p>
 <p>The clouds churned, and simultaneously, began to visibly shrink!</p>
 <p>The sight of it caused all the members of the Fang Clan to stare in speechless shock.</p>
 <p>All of the other cultivators on Planet East Victory who were watching couldn't stop themselves from gasping at the shocking sight.</p>
 <p>Fang Wei stared in amazement, and the killing intent in his eyes grew to a shocking level of intensity.</p>
 <p>“He overestimates himself!” he thought.</p>
 <p>Fang Xiushan stared in shock, panting, not daring to believe what he was seeing.</p>
 <p>The Grand Elder’s eyes were wide as he watched Meng Hao. He almost felt as if he were watching Meng Hao's grandfather, or his father Fang Xiufeng. Both of them were people who had given him such a sensation of madness.</p>
 <p>Underneath the Fang Clan, the seven Patriarchs were visibly moved. This was especially true of the Seventh Patriarch, who was already relatively familiar with Meng Hao. As of this moment, he looked up at Meng Hao with an expression of praise and approval.</p>
 <p>“To become a domineering true Immortal, you must have a domineering will,” said the Fang Clan’s Earth Patriarch, who was also a member of Meng Hao’s bloodline. His voice soft and his eyes contained deep praise. “This kid... might just succeed!”</p>
 <p>The Fang Clan was shaken, and the cultivators in the sects and clans in the outside world were utterly shocked.</p>
 <p>Fan Dong’er gasped when she sensed the madness in Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe he’s picked this way to do things,” she thought. “There's... there’s no way it will work!”</p>
 <p>Zhao Yifan was shaken mentally. Song Luodan stared with wide eyes. Wang Mu was panting. Taiyang Zi watched with an expression of complete disbelief.</p>
 <p>As everyone reacted to the insanity of Meng Hao’s actions, he coughed up some more blood. By now, the lightning around him was not red, but black, and was even more powerful than before. A vicious expression could be seen on his face as he faced the black lightning, backed by his Dharma Idol, which began to grow from a height of 21,000 meters to 24,000 meters!</p>
 <p>He was like a stage 8 Immortal fighting against Immortal Tribulation!</p>
 <p>“Nothing is impossible!” he thought. Determination could be seen in his eyes. He performed an incantation gesture, causing numerous mountains to appear, which then shot toward the Tribulation Clouds. As they exploded, Meng Hao advanced decisively, going on the offensive with all of his might.</p>
 <p>Massive booms filled the air. The ground quaked, and his 24,000-meter Dharma Idol battered the Tribulation Clouds, causing them to get smaller and smaller. Time passed, and it was impossible to say exactly how many black lightning bolts had struck Meng Hao. His Eternal stratum was in full operation, and his eyes were completely bloodshot.</p>
 <p>And yet, he never ceased attacking.</p>
 <p>The gigantic Tribulation Clouds gradually shrunk smaller and smaller. At a certain point, the black lightning bolts turned into five-colored lightning bolts, and the clouds had shrunk down by thirty percent of their original size!</p>
 <p>This sight left all observers in the Ninth Mountain and Sea completely shocked.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao's hair was disheveled, but he looked as shocking as ever as he did something completely unheard of in history!</p>
 <p>“Time to enter the realm of the... Stage 9 Immortal!” Surrounded by five-colored lightning, Meng Hao threw his head back and roared. His Dharma Idol exploded up, growing from 24,000 meters to 27,000 meters!</p>
 <p>As of this moment, everything was shaking violently!</p>
 <p>“That’s... a 27,000-meter Dharma Idol, similar to a stage 9 Immortal! Just how much did Fang Hao prepare for this? What type of cultivation does he practice? He hasn’t even opened the Door of Immortality, and yet his power has already reached such an incredible level!”</p>
 <p>“Chosen! That is a real Chosen! He’s so powerful! If he steps into true Immortality, he’ll basically be invincible!”</p>
 <p>“I remember now, he has a true Immortal fleshly body! If his cultivation base reaches the true Immortal Realm, then... He’ll be an Immortal Realm Paragon!!” Rumbling filled Planet East Victory, and all of the cultivators watching in the Ninth Mountain and Sea were completely shocked.</p>
 <p>“Who could possibly compare to him? Not Fang Wei and not Fan Dong’er. None of the other Chosen can measure...perhaps the only one who could....”</p>
 <p>“The only one who can compare… is Fang Mu!”</p>
 <p>“Fang Mu! He was the one who became the number one figure in the Ninth Mountain and Sea in the Three Great Daoist Societies’ trial by fire!”</p>
 <p>“To bust open the Tribulation Clouds and destroy them completely…. Perhaps Fang Mu could also pull it off...!”</p>
 <p>Everyone watched in shock as Meng Hao's 27,000-meter Dharma Idol battered the five-colored lightning with its fists. The clouds shattered and collapsed, and the lightning dissipated.</p>
 <p>Everything went quiet. Meng Hao hovered there alone in the sky for a moment before charging at the Tribulation Clouds again. His 27,000-meter Dharma Idol ripped away at them. From the look of things, Immortal Tribulation was by no means invincible when it was up against Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Time passed. The clouds in the starry sky continued to dissipate. By now, they had been reduced by about forty percent. The five-colored lightning was incapable of standing up to Meng Hao’s 27,000-meter Dharma Idol. But then, the lightning became seven-colored!</p>
 <p>The seven colors combined, and the lightning didn't even seem like lightning any more. It appeared to contain life force, and it rumbled toward Meng Hao, seemingly incapable of being obstructed. As it neared, Meng Hao felt a sense of deadly crisis.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, he unleashed his Immortal meridians. Behind him, his Dharma Idol grew from 27,000 meters to an astounding 30,000 meters! Everyone... was completely and utterly shocked!</p>
 <p>A 30,000-meter Dharma Idol!</p>
 <p>Golden light emanated out, illuminating the lands below. As the seven-colored lightning descended, the 30,000-meter Dharma Idol punched out. The lightning exploded, and blood oozed out of the corners of Meng Hao's mouth. However, he continued to hover there in midair, just like before.</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” Fang Wei suddenly rose to his feet, a look of complete shock on his face.</p>
 <p>Off to the side, Fang Xiushan's jaw dropped, and he staggered backward, his eyes wide.</p>
 <p>The Grand Elder was in the crowd, staring at Meng Hao’s Dharma Idol, and his face flickered several times.</p>
 <p>“It’s actually... 30,000 meters....” he murmured.</p>
 <p>The most excited of all were the members of the direct bloodline, as well as Fang Daohong and Fang Linhe. The two of them stared up into the sky at Meng Hao and his 30,000-meter Dharma Idol, and they knew that becoming followers of Meng Hao was definitely an incredible stroke of good fortune!</p>
 <p>All of the members of the Fang Clan, all of the cultivators on Planet East Victory, were sent into a tumult.</p>
 <p>“30,000 meters.... It’s really 30,000 meters! I don’t know how Fang Hao did it, but he’s actually... equivalent to a stage 10 Immortal before even stepping into true Immortality!”</p>
 <p>“Stage 10 Immortal! That’s... that’s a realm of legend! Even Fang Wei and the others only opened 90 or so Immortal meridians. Fang Wei himself only opened 98!”</p>
 <p>“This Fang Hao... if he... if he manages to open the Door of Immortality, then what do you guys think? How many... meridians will he actually open? A hundred?”</p>
 <p>The entire Ninth Mountain and Sea was completely shaken. Fan Dong’er’s face fell as she stared at the crystal. She was panting like she never had before in her life. The old woman who stood next to her watched with gleaming eyes. She knew that with a 30,000-meter Dharma Idol, these Tribulation Clouds now posed no further threat to Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Even if the tribulation grew more intense, it was nothing more than Immortal Tribulation, and would never exceed the power of the Immortal Realm.</p>
 <p>Zhao Yifan’s mind reeled, and his eyes grew blank.</p>
 <p>Song Luodan stared in shock, and Taiyang Zi gaped. Wang Mu gasped. The only one who didn't react in such a way was Wang Tengfei, whose eyes began to glow with unprecedented brightness.</p>
 <p>Li Ling’er’s face fell, and Sun Hai’s scalp went numb.</p>
 <p>The Chosen of the various sects and clans were completely astonished by Meng Hao's 30,000-meter Dharma Idol.</p>
 <p>“If he really manages to open the Door of Immortality... How many meridians will he open?!” That was the question that raged through the minds of each and every Chosen, and filled them with bitterness.</p>
 <p>By now, Meng Hao made them feel completely powerless.</p>
 <p>As for the Patriarchs of the various sects and clans, the same question was running through all their minds regarding Meng Hao, this peerless member of his generation. How many meridians would he open...?</p>
