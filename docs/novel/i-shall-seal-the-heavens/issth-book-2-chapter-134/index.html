 <p>Now that he had engaged Li Daoyi in battle, Meng Hao could tell that if he had a fourth Dao Pillar, then he would be able to end the fight quite quickly. Now, he desired more than ever to slay Li Daoyi.</p>
 <p>But Li Daoyi’s Cultivation base was at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Furthermore, he was a Li Clan Dao Child. He outclassed even Chosen, and would be difficult to kill.</p>
 <p>More important than Li Daoyi, was the mastiff. So far the mask was not under the firm control of anyone. With Li Daoyi present, it was impossible to say when the struggle would end. And if Meng Hao wanted to aid the mastiff, he needed to get rid of Li Daoyi.</p>
 <p>And his method… was to destroy the exit!</p>
 <p>Below them were churning mists. The collapse of this world was increasing in speed. The vortex roared and grew larger. Soon, the dark green sacrificial altar was more than half sucked into it.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao moved backward, flicking his sleeve. The lightning mist sprang up around him, and then shot toward the rapidly collapsing door.</p>
 <p>Li Daoyi’s expression flickered. He clenched his jaw, and a cold look appeared in his eyes. He waved his right hand, and the fan flew up, shooting toward the glowing door. A booming sound filled the air as the door cracked even more under the power of the attack.</p>
 <p>After all the destruction, the only thing left of the door was a thirty meter patch. And that patch was rapidly falling apart.</p>
 <p>“There’s no way you are as ruthless as me,” said Li Daoyi. “I don’t believe that you’ll sacrifice your life!” His body flashed as he shot forward. His right hand flickered an incantation, then gestured forward. Instantly, a yellow-colored talisman appeared behind him. It shot through his body, increasing in size exponentially as it shot toward the thirty meter wide door.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eye glittered coldly. He slapped his bag of holding to produce ten whistling flying swords. They simply could not withstand the power of Meng Hao’s three Dao Pillars, and immediately exploded into pieces.</p>
 <p>Amidst the reverberating boom, the thirty meter door shook violently as it disintegrated further. Now, only six meters were left. As for the green-colored sacrificial altar, it was almost completely sucked up by the whirling vortex. Now, the vortex began to rise up toward Meng Hao and Li Daoyi.</p>
 <p>The entire Legacy zone was on the verge of complete annihilation. Cracks appeared on every surface, and an incredible, deafening roar filled the air.</p>
 <p>Above them, the only exit was now growing smaller and smaller. At the moment, there was only three meters left. And yet, Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding again. Ten flying swords flew out. Li Daoyi’s face fell.</p>
 <p>If the swords exploded onto the door, the door, now less than a meter wide, would completely collapse. Li Daoyi suddenly thought that Meng Hao had really given up any hope of living, and was resigned to staying in this place forever.</p>
 <p>But then Meng Hao flicked his wide sleeve, and he flew up into the midst of the swords. This made it seem as though he had given up on the idea of staying, and would leave. But as he left, he would destroy the door. Then, even if Li Daoyi acquired the Legacy of the Blood Immortal, then he would have no way to leave.</p>
 <p>A conflicted look appeared in Li Daoyi’s eyes. If Meng Hao did that, then getting the Legacy would be pointless. He was about to do something to block Meng Hao, but then he realized that anything he did would most likely send out ripples that would cause the weakened door to break apart.</p>
 <p>“If I leave, the Legacy….”</p>
 <p>He didn’t want to be buried in this place. He was a Dao Child of the Li Clan. He had limitless prospects in the future. Losing out on the Legacy of the Blood Immortal wouldn’t really change anything. But dying here….</p>
 <p>“Compared to my life, the Legacy doesn’t count for anything. And who cares about some old Patriarch. Very well. But if someone else gets the Legacy, then they will be buried with it along with this place!” Li Daoyi’s eyes were red as he let out a howl. He leaped up, coughing out a mouthful of blood which splashed over him. He then transformed into a bloody shadow, which increased exponentially in size. He stretched up toward Meng Hao’s flying swords, reaching them, and Meng Hao, just as they were about to explode. He passed Meng Hao, and then shot into the door.</p>
 <p>Even as he passed into the door, his right hand waved out, and ten black pearls appeared, ready to explode, smashing the door and cutting off Meng Hao’s escape route.</p>
 <p>And yet, at the same time, as his right hand was still in the process of leaving through the screen, Meng Hao took a deep breath and then released a spell that he had been preparing for some time.</p>
 <p>“Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex, Body Sealing!” His eyes were crimson as he uttered the words. This was the first time he had ever used the mystical art he had acquired from the Eighth Generation Demon Sealer.</p>
 <p>After achieving intellectual enlightenment, Meng Hao had tried several times to use the spell, but had never succeeded. Then after the deep enlightenment from the magical text in the fifth matrix of the Blood Immortal Legacy zone, everything clicked.</p>
 <p>Using his three Perfect Dao Pillars, his fingers flickering, Meng Hao had the intense feeling that he would succeed this time. The feeling had appeared earlier in his battle with Li Daoyi, and had continued to grow stronger.</p>
 <p>His finger fell, and the entire world shuddered. And yet, it was not actually the world that had shuddered, but Meng Hao and his finger.</p>
 <p>Tiny strands of intangible Qi appeared that seemed to be somehow connected to the collapsing world. They were everywhere, blended within the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, creating ghost images of the world. It wasn’t just Meng Hao and his finger that shook. In addition to the ghost images of the world, ghost images of Li Daoyi had also appeared!</p>
 <p>Li Daoyi had not passed all the way through the glowing screen. But now, his body began to tremble and… he stopped moving!</p>
 <p>At the same time, the three Dao Pillars within Meng Hao rapidly grew dim; it seemed that as Meng Hao’s technique took effect, it was using up almost all of the spiritual power he had.</p>
 <p>Meg Hao’s face grew pale. He waved his right hand, and the lightning mist suddenly spread out, surrounding the ten pearls that were just about to explode. At the same time, the two wooden swords flew out, heading directly toward Li Daoyi. As for the other flying swords, they lost their spiritual power, and then exploded, sending ripples out in all directions.</p>
 <p>A moment passed, and Li Daoyi was beginning to recover. However, everything had happened so quickly, he was still just staring in shock. His body was already outside, but before he had a chance to do anything else, he let out a blood-curdling howl. He hadn’t pulled his right arm through in time! In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao’s wooden swords slashed it off!</p>
 <p>Within the Legacy zone, Meng Hao’s face was pale, and he coughed up blood. Everything around him was disintegrating and being sucked into the vortex. The lightning mist made a groaning rumble; it had successfully blocked the exploding attack of the ten pearls, but the glowing door rippled nonetheless, shrinking down to less than two meters in diameter.</p>
 <p>Soon the lightning mist was so thin it seemed as if it might fade away; even the sparks of electricity were nearly undetectable. Meng Hao saw Li Daoyi escape, minus his arm, and sighed inwardly. Then he turned, and rushed over to the half-violet, half-red mask, inside of which the two Blood Divinities were attempting to consume each other.</p>
 <p>At first, the red glow seemed to be winning out. But the instant Li Daoyi left, it suddenly became weak. Inside the mask, the Li Clan Patriarch trembled, his rage billowing up.</p>
 <p>“Li Daoyi!!” he roared furiously. In the past, he had been a Cultivator, but now he was incarnated as a Blood Divinity. As such, he had no choice but to follow the only true rule of the ruleless Legacy zone!</p>
 <p>The winner of the Legacy must have a Blood Divinity!</p>
 <p>Similarly, a Blood Divinity must belong to a Legacy competitor! When a Legacy competitor departed, the Blood Divinity would vanish. Only upon the competitor’s return would the Blood Divinity reappear.</p>
 <p>However, the Li Clan Patriarch had already placed himself in the mask. He didn’t disappear, and yet, because Li Daoyi had fled, he was now weakened. The glow which surrounded him began to fade.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao approached. Ignoring the disintegrating and collapsing around him, he reached out, circulating his three Dao Pillars of his Perfect Foundation, causing all of the power of heaven and earth in the area to rush toward him.</p>
 <p>The spiritual energy entered his body and then flowed into the mask, merging into the mastiff. With this assistance, the mastiff’s violet glow grew brighter, pressing down on the Blood Dragon that was the Li Clan Patriarch, completely cutting off his path of retreat. In that instant, the mastiff’s control of the mask exceeded half. And yet, it couldn’t completely take it over. Still, the mask could not be taken away.</p>
 <p>The Li Clan Patriarch couldn’t be swallowed up so easily. Despite its dangerous position, it still continued to struggle fiercely.</p>
 <p>“If you’re impenetrably thickheaded, then the worst thing that could happen is we will all die today,” rang out Meng Hao’s voice. Everything around them rumbled thunderously, collapsing into pieces. The glowing exit door was barely more than a meter wide. “If you give in, and let my Blood Divinity take control of the Legacy mask, then I won’t permit him to consume all of you. Some of your spirit can remain, and eventually the day will come when you can emerge and transform back into a person! The choice is up to you!”</p>
 <p>“What makes you think I’ll help you win!?” replied the cruel voice of the Li Clan Patriarch. “And what reason do I have to trust you!?” He knew the danger they faced, and also knew that refusing Meng Hao meant death. But he still didn’t want to give in.</p>
 <p>“You might not trust me, but you have no other options.” Meng Hao’s eyes gleamed.</p>
 <p>A moment passed, the space of ten breaths. The surroundings were beginning their final descent into destruction. The vortex was only three meters away from Meng Hao, swallowing everything up. Above him, the exit was barely a meter wide. A helpless roar sounded out from the Li Clan Patriarch.</p>
