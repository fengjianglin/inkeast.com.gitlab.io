 <p><strong>Chapter 1217: Patriarch Blacksoul!</strong></p>
 <p>Almost as soon as the man appeared, the surrounding disciples of the Blacksoul Society were enlivened, and began to cry out in loud voices.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch!!”</p>
 <p>“The Patriarch’s Dao might is completely unrivaled!!”</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Patriarch!”</p>
 <p>These disciples were terrified of Meng Hao, and found his savagery virtually impossible to describe. Were it not for the presence of their Patriarch, they would long since have fled in fear!</p>
 <p>The sect was in ruins, and many of their compatriots were dead, but as long as the Patriarch was there, the sect still existed!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered as the Blacksoul Society’s only Dao Realm expert emerged from the flames. He was the 3-Essences Dao Lord... Patriarch Blacksoul!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s mouth curled up into a cold smile. The vision he had just experienced regarding the Mountain and Sea Realm had caused many thoughts to rise up in his mind. All of a sudden, he began to back up.</p>
 <p>That was the first time had retreated since he had arrived in the Blacksoul Society. In the blink of an eye, he was in the middle of the surrounding Blacksoul Society disciples. In their shock, they watched Meng Hao wave both hands through the air, summoning numerous Immortal mountains. Then, miserable shrieks could be heard as the disciples on either side of him were crushed. It didn’t matter how they fought back or resisted, their cultivation bases were far too weak compared to his, leaving them completely unqualified to resist.</p>
 <p>It only took a moment for dozens of disciples to be reduced to a bloody mist as they were completely killed in body and spirit.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t over yet, though. Even as the Immortal mountains descended, he performed an incantation gesture and then pointed down toward the ground below. Instantly, the Immortal mountains trembled and then unexpectedly... detonated!</p>
 <p>Thousands of Immortal mountains all exploded, transforming into innumerable fragments that spread out in all directions. The ground shook and the sky lurched. In one brief moment, nearly ten thousand cultivators were wiped out by the power of the explosion.</p>
 <p>As they died, Meng Hao suddenly sensed the qi flow inside of him growing stronger. This was the same sensation he had experienced moments before, and although he did not see images of the Nine Mountains and Nine seas, the feeling was the same.</p>
 <p>It was also like… when he had received the blessing of qi flow in the Windswept Realm!</p>
 <p>The main difference was that back then, the qi flow had been given to him by the Windswept Realm, but now... he was feeling something like... the return of a qi flow!!</p>
 <p>It was similar to what had happened in the Windswept Realm, and yet was fundamentally different. One of those qi flows had been bestowed, while the other... already belonged to him!</p>
 <p>A qi flow return!!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao took a deep breath as hundreds of thoughts ran through his mind. The fact that the qi flow was returning indicated one thing: when all of that qi flow from the Mountain and Sea Realm returned to him.... he would be the Mountain and Sea Lord!</p>
 <p>An enraged roar could then be heard from within the sea of flames. “Are you looking to die!?!?”</p>
 <p>The sea of flames shot up into the air, transforming into a shooting star of fire. It moved directly toward Meng Hao with shocking speed, closing in on him in an instant, intent on blocking his attack.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the might of a 3-Essences Dao Lord rose up. It quickly became corporeal, turning into something like indestructible city walls which smashed toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Generally speaking, anyone under the Dao Realm would be completely crushed by such pressure. Even Meng Hao couldn’t stop his eyes from widening. However, he was an Allheaven Dao Immortal, which was fundamentally a defiance of the Heavens, and enabled him to rock 2-Essences Dao Realm experts. Currently, his eyes flickered as the flame meteor closed in him. Suddenly, he made a grasping motion, causing the Lightning Cauldron to appear. Electricity danced, and just as the flame meteor was about to engulf him, he switched places with an Ancient Realm cultivator.</p>
 <p>Moments ago, this Ancient Realm cultivator had been fighting the black imps off in the distance, until all of a sudden, he was in a new location. His vision swam, and then the sea of flames caused him to scream as he was engulfed. “Noooo....”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Blacksoul showed no reaction whatsoever at having killed the wrong person, but his desire to kill Meng Hao climbed to the pinnacle. He was a cautious person, and had originally planned to use the power of the sect as a whole to probe Meng Hao and see what trump cards this daring individual held, who dared to take on a whole sect.</p>
 <p>But now that Meng Hao had actually already destroyed the Blacksoul Society, Patriarch Blacksoul’s hand was forced, and he personally appeared. As of now, it didn’t matter what trump cards Meng Hao might have, he had to show his face.</p>
 <p>However, after showing up to fight, Meng Hao didn’t battle him, but instead began to slaughter his disciples. That caused Patriarch Blacksoul’s rage to grow even stronger. As the flame meteor shot toward Meng Hao, the figure within the flames stepped forward, instantly spanning the distance between himself and Meng Hao. Then he stretched out his hand violently to grab Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>That grasping motion caused the natural laws in the area to twist. The land was transformed, as if this will were the will of Heaven, as if this Dao were the Dao of Heaven, as if this Essence could shake the Mountains and Seas!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered. However, even as Patriarch Blacksoul appeared in front of him, he waved his finger.</p>
 <p>Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!</p>
 <p>The hex immediately bound up Patriarch Blacksoul. Although he was able to break free almost immediately, that still bought Meng Hao some time, and also interfered with the natural laws, making his effort to supplant the will of Heaven become unstable.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s Lightning Cauldron flickered again, and he switched positions with someone further back who was in the great circle of the Ancient Realm. Without any hesitation, he waved his hand, causing an intense sensation of danger to rise up in the man’s mind. Even as the man turned to charge toward him, a swath of Divine Flame suddenly sprang up and consumed him.</p>
 <p>A bloodcurdling scream rang out as the magnificent great circle Ancient Realm cultivator was wiped out by the Divine Flame. In the blink of an eye, the charging cultivator was transformed into ash; not even his Nascent Divinity could escape, and was completely destroyed.</p>
 <p>“Dammit!” Patriarch Blacksoul said, glaring at Meng Hao. Meng Hao was being very troublesome; especially the way he used his Lightning Cauldron, making it almost impossible to do anything to him.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Blacksoul suddenly snorted coldly, then performed a double-handed incantation gesture and pointed toward the sky.</p>
 <p>“Fire!”</p>
 <p>Immediately, the land began to shake, and roaring filled the sky. A black sea of flames appeared, which began to sweep out in all directions.</p>
 <p>Then, Patriarch Blacksoul pointed down, causing the land to tremble.</p>
 <p>“Earth!”</p>
 <p>The shattered lands below began to form together into a Soil Golem, surrounded by countless drifting motes of dust which swirled around it.</p>
 <p>“Wind!”</p>
 <p>Next, Patriarch Blacksoul stamped his foot down violently, causing rumbling to echo out as a black wind sprang up. It stoked the sea of flames, causing the fire to rise up, sending a blast of heat across the dust and rubble in the area, giving rise to a massive tempest!</p>
 <p>“3 Essences; seal sky and land; melt the Heavens; become... a Dao Lord Prison!” As soon as the words left Patriarch Blacksoul's mouth, the wind, fire, and earth transformed into three sealing marks which covered the entire world!</p>
 <p>Each essence caused Meng Hao to feel increasing pressure weighing down on him. By the time the third one appeared, he was locked in place in midair. Massive rumbling could be heard as the disciples in Meng Hao’s vicinity were forcibly pushed away from him.</p>
 <p>A tempest caused him to spin in place as Patriarch Blacksoul strode toward him through the winds. Then Patriarch Blacksoul extended his right hand, his eyes flickered with killing intent as he made to grab Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>That gesture caused the natural law of Heaven and Earth to transform. An enormous face appeared, which was none other than Patriarch Blacksoul’s face. It felt as if the entire world were filled with Patriarch Blacksoul’s aura, as if his will had replaced the natural laws. It was as if this small portion of the universe, and its Dao of Heaven, had been completely replaced by Patriarch Blacksoul!</p>
 <p>This was the most terrifying aspect of Dao Lords. They could become the Lords of the world in which they existed. Furthermore... they were the Lords of the Dao of Heaven there. That was why 3-Essences Dao Realm cultivators were referred to as Dao Lords!</p>
 <p>“How will you flee now? How will you exterminate my Blacksoul Society disciples now?!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Blacksoul’s voice echoed out, causing the disciples Meng Hao had just been slaughtering to roar excitedly in support of their Patriarch.</p>
 <p>Their voices joined together like thunder, and their killing intent merged and radiated out as they waited in anticipation for their Patriarch to eradicate Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>However, even as Patriarch Blacksoul neared Meng Hao, and the hand that superseded the Dao of Heaven appeared in front of him, Meng Hao’s eyes glittered, and he stretched both hands out to his sides.</p>
 <p>Scintillating light suddenly shone out as a hand-sized clump of dirt suddenly shot out from Meng Hao’s bag of holding, and he responded to Patriarch Blacksoul. “I’ll kill your disciples and then you’ll know!”</p>
 <p>As soon as the clump appeared, it began to grow with wild speed. Soon it was 300 meters, then 3,000 and then 30,000. It was indescribably heavy, and all of that weight instantly bore down onto Patriarch Blacksoul.</p>
 <p>It slammed into his hand, causing a huge boom to echo out. At the same time, Meng Hao was hit with a backlash attack, causing blood to spray out of his mouth, and his body to tremble on the verge of collapse.</p>
 <p>However, he forced himself to resist, and his eyes gleamed with a vicious expression. He looked at Patriarch Blacksoul, who was currently facing the 30,000-meter land mass, his face flickering. An intense sensation of deadly crisis exploded out within Patriarch Blacksoul as he realized how indescribably heavy the land mass was.</p>
 <p>It was so heavy that it could even crush natural laws. It didn’t matter that Patriarch Blacksoul had replaced the will of the world he was in, that 30,000-meter land mass was like a dull blade that could cut a hole in the entire world with its weight alone.</p>
 <p>“Th-that’s... a piece of the Ruins of Immortality!” Patriarch Blacksoul’s face fell, and he immediately fell back. However, the land mass continued to descend. Completely ignoring the tempest of three Essences, it crushed down toward the surface of the planet itself.</p>
 <p>From down below, the land mass was like an enormous shadow, rumbling downward. All of the cultivators who saw it were completely astonished and began to cry out in alarm.</p>
 <p>“What... what is that!?!?”</p>
 <p>“Let’s get out of here!!”</p>
 <p>The Blacksoul Society disciples that were currently in the shadow of the descending land mass held nothing back in their attempts to flee. However, the shadow itself seemed to have some strange, magnetic power that made it impossible for them to flee.</p>
 <p>All they could do was scream in despair and look at the enormous darkness growing larger and larger above them. And then... they were crushed.</p>
