 <p><strong>Chapter 396: A Real Demon Nurturing Pill!</strong></p>
 <p>ROOAAARRR!!</p>
 <p>A new sound could be heard from deep within the endless, forested mountains. The roar drifted out, seemingly filled with the power to rip everything into shreds!</p>
 <p>It sounded like bolts of lightning fighting each other, which then coalesced into a howl, and then, a voice.</p>
 <p>“Outlander!” The voice sounded like countless other voices combined together. The strangest thing was that anyone who heard it could tell that this was not the roar of a Cultivator. No… this voice was not human!</p>
 <p>The instant the voice appeared, it echoed out in all directions, causing all other sounds within the mountains and forests to instantly cease.</p>
 <p>The hearts and minds of the members of the five Tribes were instantly shaken. Their faces immediately revealed astonishment.</p>
 <p>“That’s….”</p>
 <p>“That’s the Outlander Beast! The Outlander Beast with the roar of an Immortal!!”</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe the Outlander Beast with an Immortal roar is in this area! It was born as a level 7 great neo-demon, and then grew up into a level 11! Was it branded by a human, or is it actually a Greater Demon?”</p>
 <p>In the Western Desert, if a creature was branded and sealed by humans, it was referred to as a neo-demon. Those which were not were Greater Demons!</p>
 <p>As the members of the five Tribes of the Crow Divinity were all discussing the matter, the peak level neo-demons were trembling. The roar just now only served to further fuel their own roars. It was as if they wanted to proclaim to this Outlander Beast that the region it was passing through belonged to them!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the ground began to quake and tremble violently. Something that seemed like a giant was speeding through the forest. Among the shocked members of the five Tribes, people began to employ secret magical techniques to view what was happening in the mountains around them. Within the rugged mountains was a vast sea of beasts, madly charging toward them.</p>
 <p>The beasts were made up of a variety of levels, and all of them had eyes red and filled with madness as they ran. Up in the sky was a vast collection of strange flying creatures. They, too, were shrieking. From a distance, it seemed as if a huge wave of beasts was surging toward the five Tribes from all direction.</p>
 <p>They filled the sky and land in all directions, with the five Tribes in the center. They would obviously be completely crushed.</p>
 <p>For the five Tribes, this was a monumental disaster, a calamity that had sprung up so suddenly that they didn’t even have time to react.</p>
 <p>Ripples spread out in the air as the flying beasts roared. The thunderous sound created an echo which suppressed everything as it neared.</p>
 <p>All of this happened in the space of only fifteen breaths!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao could feel the ground shaking, and could hear the roars from outside, including that of the Outlander Beast. Because of everything that was happening, it actually gave him a bit more time than before.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, he thought, “I never imagined that combining Demonic Qi with the Demon Nurturing Pill would cause such a shocking scene. This medicinal pill… will apparently drive any neo-demon completely crazy.” With a bitter smile, he looked over at the five little wolves, who were frantically trying to break through the wooden planks to get at him. Cracking sounds suddenly rang out as they succeeded.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes glittered as he waved his right hand. The medicinal pill shot toward the wooden kennel. The five little wolves emitted cute howls as they charged toward it. In recent days they had played a lot with each other, but there was no affection in them now. They nipped and bit at each other violently as they ran.</p>
 <p>It was at this point that the little Greenwood Wolf with the white scar on its head gave full vent to its power and ferocity. It slashed at the other little wolves and then transformed into a green beam of light that shot forward. It directly swallowed the medicinal pill.</p>
 <p>As soon as it did, the crowds of beasts outside the five Tribes began to emit mournful howls. A collection of black clouds seethed up above in the sky, and then suddenly shot forward. As they did, the roar of the Outlander Beast shook everything.</p>
 <p>All the Cultivators in the five Tribes had pale faces. That was because….</p>
 <p>Located in the center of the five Tribes was their Holy Land, the former location of the Crow Divinity Tribe. Suddenly a beam of light shot out into the dark night from that very place!</p>
 <p>It was a five-colored beam that spread out to cover over all five Tribes. From within the light emerged a black crow.</p>
 <p>The crow raised its head and let out a shrill screech that was like a violent tempest. Ripples spread out in all directions, seemingly filled with the power to crush everything.</p>
 <p>As the ripples seethed out, many of the huge trees in the forest were ripped up by the roots. The land heaved, and great boulders were ripped up from the earth. It was like an unspeakably powerful tempest had risen up around the five Tribes.</p>
 <p>It quickly transformed into a vortex which swept across everything.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was panting as he looked off toward the former location of the Crow Divinity Tribe, and his eyes glowed brightly.</p>
 <p>By this point, he wasn’t worried anymore. All traces of the medicinal pill that had instigated the disturbance had disappeared as soon as the little wolf consumed it. Meng Hao was quite sensitive to Demonic Qi, so he was able to confirm that this was the case.</p>
 <p>Apparently, the Demonic Qi had already been absorbed by the little wolf with the white scar, who by this time had lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
 <p>Despite being unconscious, though, its life force was soaring up vigorously.</p>
 <p>The tempest outside covered everything, making the only thing visible the five-colored light. The sight of it caused Meng Hao to think of his own Five-Colored Tribulation.</p>
 <p>Two days ago, when Meng Hao had come to the Crow Scout Tribe, he’d sent the parrot and the meat jelly away. It was impossible to say what they were up to in the surrounding mountains.</p>
 <p>Thinking of them being in the tempest caused Meng Hao to feel a bit nervous. However, after considering the parrot's eccentricities and the meat jelly’s indestructibility, he realized he didn’t need to worry.</p>
 <p>“Even if this entire place were completely destroyed, they would be happy and healthy.” Meng Hao was certain of this point.</p>
 <p>The tempest lasted for about two hours. When it subsided, much of the surrounded forest was gone. Vast quantities of neo-demon corpses could be seen. As for the Outlander Beast, there was no sign of it.</p>
 <p>The crow was gone, and the five-colored light had faded away. This was the first time Meng Hao had experienced the true mystery and power of Western Desert Cultivators and their totems.</p>
 <p>The members of the five Tribes gradually spread out around in their respective areas to collect the neo-demon corpses.</p>
 <p>As for the Neo-Demon Kennelist district, it was searched several times with Divine Sense, but nothing out of the ordinary was found.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao also came under investigation. However, the treasured magical item of Patriarch Transmutation Li Tian proved to be extremely useful. Nobody noticed anything even slightly unusual about Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>For the five Tribes, the fact that they had narrowly escaped disaster meant that a simple investigation would most likely not uncover the truth of the matter. Secret probing continued for the next month. Whenever Meng Hao went out into the mountains, he would be questioned.</p>
 <p>However, even after a month, no information had been uncovered. Gradually people began to come to the conclusion that some strange object had appeared that attracted the neo-demons and then the wave of beasts. As for who had finally acquired this object, no one knew for sure, but all the five Tribes were now suspicious of each other.</p>
 <p>During the month, Meng Hao focused on taking good care of the little Greenwood Wolves. He mixed meat with Demon Nurturing Pills, which caused the little wolves to continuously grow bigger and stronger. However, Meng Hao was also careful to control their growth so that it wasn’t too fast.</p>
 <p>As for the little wolf who had consumed the Demonic Qi Pill, externally he didn’t seem very different. However, he was now more fierce, and his eyes shone with a cold glow. He seemed more bloodthirsty, and the other little wolves clearly revered him. All he had to do was let out a growl, and the other little wolves would start to tremble.</p>
 <p>The changes in him continued to manifest, and Meng Hao couldn’t come up with any method to suppress them. In any case, as the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, Meng Hao’s ability to sense Demonic Qi was incomparable.</p>
 <p>After the month passed, all of the investigations, both the public and the secret ones, ceased. Everything around Meng Hao once again grew calm, and he began to use his own methods to raise the neo-demons.</p>
 <p>Time passed by. Soon, Meng Hao had been in the Crow Scout Tribe for five months.</p>
 <p>Currently, he sat cross-legged in his courtyard. Suddenly, a threatening howl filled his ears, and he opened his eyes. There in the courtyard, one of the Greenwood Wolves was facing off against the other four. It looked somewhat thin and weak, but the threatening howl it emitted caused the other Greenwood Wolves to tremble in fear.</p>
 <p>“Big Hairy,” said Meng Hao coolly. As soon as the words left his mouth, the weak-looking Greenwood Wolf turned to look at Meng Hao. There on its forehead, the white scar was clearly visible.</p>
 <p>When it looked at Meng Hao, the coldness in its eyes vanished and turned into a charming expression of cleverness. It transformed into a green beam that shot like lightning over to Meng Hao. It lay down next to him, sticking its tongue out to lick Meng Hao’s leg, just like the mastiff used to do.</p>
 <p>“Hairys #2, #3, #4, and #5, all of you come over here,” Meng Hao said with a laugh. The other four Greenwood Wolves cautiously trotted over.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s Greenwood Wolves could now no longer be called little. Each of them was roughly two meters long and looked very intimidating. Their eyes glowed with cold savagery, and their bodies were covered with green fur. The speed with which they moved was like lightning, and their personalities exuded cold-bloodedness. Everything about them seemed incredibly powerful.</p>
 <p>They were no longer level 1 neo-demons, but level 2. Despite that, they were strong enough to slaughter level 3 neo-demons, and even hold their own against level 4.</p>
 <p>Most shocking was Big Hairy. Though he looked skinny and weak, and was only level 2, he was actually stronger than other level 4 Greenwood Wolves. He could easily defeat any that he faced up against, and unless Meng Hao stopped him, would kill them.</p>
 <p>With the exception of the big hubbub at the beginning, Meng Hao didn’t cause any problems in the Tribe. He didn’t have much contact with others, and few people other than Wu Hai had anything to do with him.</p>
 <p>As for Wu Hai, he thoroughly admired Meng Hao, and would come often to ask him for advice. Each time, he left feeling enlightened. Gradually, a friendship formed between the two.</p>
 <p>Wu Hai wasn’t sure exactly what techniques Meng Hao used to raise the Greenwood Wolves, but he could see that they were different from normal Greenwood Wolves. He didn’t understand, but in his eyes, it was amazing, and only served to cause him to further approve of Meng Hao.</p>
