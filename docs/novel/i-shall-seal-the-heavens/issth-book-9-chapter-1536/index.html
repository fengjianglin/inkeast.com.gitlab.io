 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>Countless people and other life forms heard the words. They echoed out in the Immortal God Continent, the Devil Realm Continent, countless other worlds and Realms, and even in the Mountain and Sea Butterfly. Everyone heard.</p>
 <p>Within the Mountain and Sea Butterfly, many people who knew Meng Hao were left flabbergasted by the words.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the entire world within which he stood went completely silent. With his Essences completely combined, an aura which did not belong to the starry sky of the Vast Expanse raged up. It grew more and more powerful, and as it did, countless illusory chains appeared all around Meng Hao. One by one, those chains exploded!</p>
 <p>As those chains were destroyed, his aura grew more shocking and incredible. This cultivation base breakthrough put him at a level in which he could... directly fight back against the will of Allheaven!</p>
 <p>Within his qi passageways, any power which had anything to do with the natural laws of the Vast Expanse... vanished. They were replaced by a Demonic qi that could shake Heaven and Earth, that could stain the world red. Meng Hao’s hair turned crimson, and suddenly, an endless ocean of blood appeared around him.</p>
 <p>He had the feeling that this world, this starry sky, could be changed by him with a single thought. He could manipulate it or even destroy it if he wished. At the same time, he felt a force of expulsion appear, something that apparently wanted to drive him away.</p>
 <p>The enormous finger up above began to shake, and the three-headed six-armed figures looked at Meng Hao with fear, as if they didn’t dare to get close to him.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked around, and everything seemed different.</p>
 <p>He saw the natural and magical laws of the world. He saw threads running here and there. He saw things that he had never been able to see before. He saw that the clone of Patriarch Vast Expanse was actually a Soul Shadow. He saw that the finger up above was actually composed of countless magical symbols, sealing marks.</p>
 <p>“So, this is what it feels like to Transcend,” he thought. “It's too bad... I don’t count as having fully Transcended. Cultivation base, body, and soul. Only by breaking through in all three areas can one truly be considered Transcendent.</p>
 <p>“For example, Paragon Nine Seals only achieved fleshly body Transcendence.</p>
 <p>“As for me, my cultivation base has Transcended, but not my body or my soul....</p>
 <p>“Well, I might as well use my Transcendent cultivation base to extinguish the bronze lamp. With that good fortune, I can then push toward Transcendence with my fleshly body!</p>
 <p>“With my cultivation base and my fleshly body both in Transcendence, the resonance they create will enable my soul... to transform, and also step into Transcendence!</p>
 <p>“At that time, I will truly be in... the Daosource Realm!</p>
 <p>“That is because I will be the source of the Dao, an Essence. What I wish to be natural law, will exist. Whatever magical laws I don’t approve of, will not exist.” With that, he waved his sleeve, and... the bronze lamp appeared!</p>
 <p>As of this moment, no one could stop Meng Hao on his path to Transcendence!</p>
 <p>Not the starry sky of the Vast Expanse, nor the will of Allheaven!</p>
 <p>Within the ancient sky of the necropolis, the enormous finger formed from the embodiment of the will of Allheaven trembled. A brutal aura erupted from within it, raging in all directions, causing everything in Heaven and Earth to blur. Only the finger remained clear.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as the pressure emanating off of Meng Hao because of his breakthrough, was shattered. Meng Hao might have reached this point, but the will of Allheaven could not accept that he might successfully continue to Transcend.</p>
 <p>The power of expulsion from the starry sky of the Vast Expanse suddenly exploded out. It affected the entire ancient world, causing all of the cultivators who had appeared to tremble.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Vast Expanse’s clone looked on with glittering eyes. He was just about to take action, but after looking over at Meng Hao, he smiled slightly and then looked off into the distance, seemingly oblivious to what was happening.</p>
 <p>The enormous finger continued to descend, and the lands shook. A huge crevice opened up, spreading out rapidly. Apparently the entire land mass was about to collapse.</p>
 <p>The finger superseded the sky, drawing ever closer. Soon, what Meng Hao was looking up at wasn’t a finger, it was a series of mountains and plains!</p>
 <p>Those were... the fingerprint, within which was the power of the starry sky of the Vast Expanse, a power completely focused on slaying Meng Hao before he could fully Transcend.</p>
 <p>However, even as the finger descended, Meng Hao swished his wide sleeve, and the bronze lamp floated up front of him, burning brightly, its appearance ancient, even primitive. Meng Hao took a deep breath. Eyes shining with anticipation and focus, he focused the power of his Transcendent cultivation base, and then...</p>
 <p>Blew a breath out of his mouth!</p>
 <p>That breath was like a storm, a tempest that linked Heaven and Earth, a cyclone that rose up and slammed into the finger formed by Allheaven.</p>
 <p>A huge boom echoed out. The sky shattered and the land crumbled. However, the cyclone was incapable of fighting the destructive finger of Allheaven, and vanished.</p>
 <p>However, by the time that happened, Meng Hao's breath, which was backed by the power of his Transcendent cultivation base, had already blown across the bronze lamp. As it did, the flame flickered wildly, then bent over to the side... and was extinguished!</p>
 <p>That was Meng Hao’s final Soul Lamp!</p>
 <p>That was the bronze lamp which he had acquired in a stroke of incredible good fortune, which had saved his life!</p>
 <p>That was Patriarch Vast Expanse’s bronze lamp!</p>
 <p>As of this moment, it was extinguished!</p>
 <p>Instantly, green smoke appeared, which rapidly entered Meng Hao’s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.</p>
 <p>When the last bit of green smoke left the bronze lamp, it turned into drifting ash. It was as if, after completing its mission, it dissipated into Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>It was in that exact same moment that the finger of the will of Allheaven, the finger which was bursting with the power to destroy worlds, reached a position 3,000 meters away from Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked up at the fingerprints, which resembled vast mountains and plains. His clothes were whipping back and forth in the wind, and his hair was completely disheveled.</p>
 <p>The finger accelerated.</p>
 <p>“DIE!” screamed a voice from nowhere. It seemed to command ultimate authority, to contain within it the natural laws of the Vast Expanse, the power of the starry sky as a whole. All of that was rumbling toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>It only took a moment for it to be directly in front of Meng Hao. It was as if the Heavens themselves were descending upon him. But Meng Hao simply reached out and pushed against the finger with his hand.</p>
 <p>The moment his hand made contact, rumbling sounds filled him, and blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth. Crevices snaked out from beneath his feet as everything crumbled. The entire land mass shattered into rubble which dropped down. Now there was nothing beneath Meng Hao but an empty starry sky.</p>
 <p>However, Meng Hao himself didn't move an inch. He hovered there, bracing himself against the finger of Allheaven. Although blood was oozing out of the corners of his mouth, his eyes shone with a terrifying glow.</p>
 <p>His pupils were bright red, which was the foundation of the Demon, and could not be changed. Perhaps instead of calling it Demonic, it would be more appropriate to call it chaotic. It was the ultimate form of chaos, a chaos from within which could be born a completely contradictory natural law.</p>
 <p>This was Meng Hao’s version of the Demon. However, that was not his Essence. His Essence was more than that. In what had once been the whites of his eyes, a new color appeared. Violet!</p>
 <p>He had violet eyes and red pupils, and the aura he emanated was completely impossible to describe with words. It was as if he were the ultimate form of chaos, as if he were completely at odds with the entire world, with Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>Even as his right hand pushed against the finger, he smiled.</p>
 <p>“By this point, nobody can destroy me. Nobody can control my fate. Nobody... is qualified to manipulate my path.</p>
 <p>“Even the will of the starry sky of the Vast Expanse... does not qualify!</p>
 <p>“You are dismissed!” He shoved his hand forward, and thunderous rumbling emanated out. Beneath his skin could be seen numerous wriggling, snake-like objects. However, they weren’t snakes, they were the strands of green smoke he had absorbed from the bronze lamp.</p>
 <p>Numerous strands of smoke flowed like mad through his body. They contained boundless life force which strengthened him, causing him to grow more powerful by the moment.</p>
 <p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p>
 <p>Veins bulged out on Meng Hao’s neck and face as he took a step forward, pushing onto the finger, which had no choice but to fall back.</p>
 <p>It didn't want to, but the power of Meng Hao’s fleshly body could shake Heaven and Earth, and was forcing it backward.</p>
 <p>The light of time flickered dully, and the world seemed to be on the verge of collapsing completely. An enraged roar echoed out as the finger pushed out with more power than before, still intent on wiping out Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes shone with bright red light. His qi passageways had reached their limit, and began to explode. Countless motes of scintillating light filled his body, and at the same time, his flesh and blood began to transform. His bones, his body, his qi passageways, and even his blood apparently ceased to exist.</p>
 <p>However, from the outside, he looked the same as ever. That was because, by this point, his body was neither mortal nor cultivator. A thunderous, Heaven-rending Earth-crushing boom rang out. It was as if the starry sky was bearing witness to Meng Hao as he took another step forward, threw his head back, and let loose a long cry.</p>
