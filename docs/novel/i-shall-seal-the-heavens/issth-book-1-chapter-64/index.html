 <p><strong>Chapter 64: A Massacre Caused by a Silver Spear</strong></p>
 <p>When the wooden sword connected with the arrow, it began to emit a droning sound. It was pushed back by the force of the arrow and smacked into Meng Hao’s forehead. Blood sprayed from his mouth, as he was sent spinning backward. As for the arrow, its power was spent, and it transformed into ash, which drifted away in the wind.</p>
 <p>As Meng Hao flew backwards, he slapped his bag of holding, and produced a Demonic Core, which he swallowed. He was running low on Earthly Spirit Pills, so he opted for the Demonic Core. His eyes were shot with blood, and his injuries were severe. This was perhaps the worst he had been hurt since becoming a Cultivator.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, the wooden sword was truly a treasured item and hadn’t been damaged at all. Actually, the reason Meng Hao had been sent flying back was because his Cultivation base wasn’t high enough to completely control the sword. If it were, the arrow wouldn’t have even been able to make the wooden sword move back an inch.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s body was wracked in pain, and his mind a bit clouded. But his innate desire to survive still existed. He bit his tongue, and used the pain to focus. He lifted his pale, bloodless face and looked off into the distance. Currently approaching was a young man in a white robe, flying on an enormous green leaf.</p>
 <p>His face was calm, and his eyes cold, without a trace of arrogance. However, a single look at him would leave anyone without doubt that he was superior to others.</p>
 <p>His Cultivation base was at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, and yet he appeared to be only twenty-two or twenty-three years old. Seeing him approach, Liu Daoyun, who was also at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, narrowed his eyes.</p>
 <p>He instantly understood. “At his age… he must be a Chosen from a great Sect,” he said to himself.</p>
 <p>“White robes….” Meng Hao wiped the blood from his mouth, staring at the white-robed youth.</p>
 <p>“I am Ding Xin [1. Ding Xin's name in Chinese is 丁信 (dīng xìn) - Ding is a common family name. Xin means "believe" or "faith"] from the Violet Fate Sect,” he said coolly. “I’m here to take your life, on orders from the Sect Leader.” He had been dispatched months ago to the State of Zhao to search for Meng Hao. Using his own special methods, he had finally caught his trail today. He had actually been watching for some time, waiting to make his move.</p>
 <p>He was completely different from Qian Shuihen and Lu Song. As an Inner Sect disciple, he was frequently sent out on Sect business. He was one of the Chosen of the Violet Fate Sect, destined to reach Foundation Establishment. When that happened, he would be a true Chosen. Handling matters outside of the Sect was simply training for him.</p>
 <p>He was vastly more experienced than Qian Shuihen, and had even made a name for himself in the Southern Domain in the past two years. His personality was cold, his attacks ruthless. Back in the Southern Domain, he would always consider the reputation of his Sect. But here in the State of Zhao, he could be a bit less restrained.</p>
 <p>He had attacked Meng Hao when he was in critical danger, and had never imagined that Meng Hao would actually be able to survive the lethal arrow.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s face was grim. Three waves of attackers had appeared today. Two were of the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and two were of the ninth. Based on his Cultivation base alone, he couldn't stand up to them. Furthermore, he was seriously injured. The situation was very dangerous.</p>
 <p>Watching Ding Xin approach, Liu Daoyun’s eyes flickered, and he felt somewhat nervous. Yet his eyes were determined. He would not give up.</p>
 <p>Zhou and Xu from the Winding Stream Sect, seemed even more hesitant. If they only had to deal with Liu Daoyun, they could do it. But now that the Violet Fate Sect had made an appearance, they were less convinced.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes glittered faintly. His right hand slapped his bag of holding and five feathers flew out, combining with the four beneath his feet to make a nine-feathered fan. It took to flight, carrying him away at high speed.</p>
 <p>Ding Xin's eyes were calm. He flicked his sleeve, and the giant leaf beneath his feet flashed as he shot off in pursuit. Liu Daoyun burst into motion as well. Zhou and Xun from the Winding Stream Sect gritted their teeth, then joined in the pursuit.</p>
 <p>Sun Hua wasn’t fast enough and had already been forced to drop to the ground. But, he wasn’t willing to give up, so he followed as fast as possible on foot.</p>
 <p>The three waves of people were incredibly fast, so Meng Hao swallowed another Demonic Core. The coldness within him was still very strong, and his body was covered with sword wounds which oozed blood.</p>
 <p>He clenched his jaw and circulated his spiritual power, then slapped his bag of holding. A silver light flashed in his hand. It was none other than the silver spear!</p>
 <p>Liu Daoyun’s vision immediately became focused on it, and he slowed down a bit. Ding Xin, with his flashing eyes, as well as Zhou and Xu from the Winding Stream Sect, had never before laid eyes on the long silver spear. But Sun Hua, who was still running along on the ground, had. He immediately shouted out: “That’s the silver spear! That’s the treasured gift from Patriarch Reliance!!”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Zhou and Xu slowed down a bit, their eyes shining fiercely.</p>
 <p>“You are all after this silver spear?” said Meng Hao. “Very well then. It requires a lot of spiritual power to use. Its true might can’t even be utilized unless you are at Foundation Establishment stage. If you are powerful enough to use it, then be my guest!” His face twisted with an expression of incomparable pain, as if he were throwing everything away in an attempt to save himself, he tossed the spear away as hard as he could.</p>
 <p>He put all the spiritual power he could muster into his arm as he flung it. The silver spear hummed, transforming into a silver-colored rainbow as it shot off into the distance, shining so brightly that it virtually forced everyone’s eyes to follow it.</p>
 <p>The instant it flew off, Meng Hao’s treasured fan transformed into a beam of light that shot off in the opposite direction.</p>
 <p>Interestingly (whether or not it was on purpose was hard to tell) the spear just happened to fly in the direction of the three pursuing disciples from the Cold Wind Sect. When they saw the silver spear flying toward them, they gaped in shock.</p>
 <p>Sun Hua’s eyes were red, and with a hoarse shout, he changed directions, running directly toward the silver spear. Killing intent billowed from his face, he slapped his bag of holding, and a sword aura emerged. He clearly intended to kill anyone who dared to take the spear from him.</p>
 <p>Further behind him, the ten or more Winding Stream Sect disciples raced forward even harder.</p>
 <p>Liu Daoyun’s facial expression changed as he debated to himself about whether or not the spear was real. Because he was not at the Foundation Establishment stage, he didn’t have Spiritual Sense, so it was difficult to make a judgement about this matter. There was a fifty-fifty chance about it, but in his mind, it didn’t matter. He couldn’t just let the Winding Stream Sect disciples gang up on his fellow disciples.</p>
 <p>If they did, and word got out, he would be severely punished when he returned to the Sect.</p>
 <p>And if the spear was real… well, if he gave up under those circumstances his punishment would be even more severe when he returned to the Sect. He was damned if he did, damned if he didn’t. He clenched his jaw.</p>
 <p>“Dammit!” Liu Daoyun abandoned his pursuit of Meng Hao and made a beeline for the spear.</p>
 <p>Zhou and Xu hesitated, watching as the long spear flew off, pursued by both Sun Hua and their fellow Winding Stream Sect disciples. At first, they weren’t sure if they should chase after the spear, but when they saw Liu Daoyun speeding off after it, they made their decision, shooting off in the same direction.</p>
 <p>Only Ding Xin from the Violet Fate Sect stopped, his eyes flashing. His task was to slay Meng Hao, so he didn’t care whether the treasure was real or fake. With a cold laugh, his eyes shining, he pushed his giant leaf into a beam of prismatic light, speeding after Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Two people, one up ahead, one behind. One fleeing as fast as he could, the other pursuing with a magical item backed by the power of the ninth level of Qi Condensation. They disappeared over the horizon.</p>
 <p>As for Liu Daoyun, he flew quickly in the direction of the silver spear, and seemed to be on the verge of reaching it, when someone howled out from behind him.</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Thunder Spirit!”</p>
 <p>As soon as the sound rang out, a black cloud formed in the sky above Liu Daoyun, and the crackling of thunder could be heard as a lightning bolt struck down toward him.</p>
 <p>His face grew dark. He slapped his bag of holding, and a coldness spread out and shot toward the lightning bolt.</p>
 <p>The lightning bolt dissipated with a booming sound, and the intense coldness continued onward to enter the black thundercloud. It began to rumble, as if it were about to break apart.</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Thunder Spirit, detonate!”</p>
 <p>Under normal circumstances, Zhou and Xu would never do something like this. But with the silver spear in play, and the Winding Stream Sect disciples on the ground having the upper hand, they couldn’t allow Liu Daoyun to enter the fray. Now that they had abandoned their pursuit of Meng Hao, they could pour all their combined power into play.</p>
 <p>A massive explosion reverberated out as the thundercloud exploded. The force of it shot out in all directions. Zhou and Xu coughed up blood. Liu Daoyun, also injured, was not in a good position. A crystalline glow appeared in front of him as blood seeped from the corners of his mouth.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that the silver spear slammed into the ground. As it did, the Cold Wind disciples were about to grab. But then Sun Hua arrived, a savage look on his face. Behind him swarmed the Winding Stream Sect disciples, their faces radiating ferocity.</p>
 <p>“This treasured item belongs to the Winding Stream Sect!” shouted Sun Hua excitedly. If he was the first person to lay hands on the spear, it might not end up belonging to him, but the Sect would definitely reward him. Perhaps he would end up having a breakthrough in this Cultivation base, and reach the eighth level!</p>
 <p>The three Cold Wind Sect disciples were just reaching their hands up to take the spear, when they were surrounded by the ten or so others. They howled as the Winding Stream Sect disciples attacked them. They could do little more than watch as the prize which had just moments ago been theirs, was taken away.</p>
 <p>“So brazen!” shouted Liu Daoyun, turning his head to see what was happening. His roar rumbled out, and he completely ignored Zhou and Xu. He waved his hand toward Sun Hua, and the Cold Wind Finger appeared, shooting forward as fast as lightning.</p>
 <p>Considering the level of Sun Hua’s Cultivation base, he simply couldn’t avoid the attack. His facial expression changed into one of savagery, and he gritted his teeth. His only hope lay in the treasured item. As the Cold Wind Finger approached, he snatched up the long silver spear, brandishing it in an imposing manner.</p>
 <p>“You’re defeated!” he shouted. Liu Daoyun’s eyes focused on the spear as it flew into the air. Zhou and Xun held their breath.</p>
 <p>The silver spear flashed as it flew forward, making a beautiful, silver arc. The instant it met the Cold Wind Finger, a bang sounded out. It wasn’t a very loud bang. The spear broke apart, most of it shattering into dust, with only a few fragments remaining intact.</p>
 <p>Sun Hua gaped in astonishment. It was the last astonished look he would ever give, as the Cold Wind Finger pierced into his chest. His body shuddered, and a boom rang out, louder than that emitted by the silver spear, as he exploded.</p>
 <p>Liu Daoyun stared in shock, as did Zhou and Xu. The Cold Wind Sect and Winding Stream Sect disciples were also dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>Everything was suddenly quiet, except for the sound reverberating out from the attack that had killed Sun Hua.</p>
 <p>Liu Daoyun was the first one to move again. He went forward and began to collect up the remaining fragments of silver. Zhou and Xu also approached and picked up some of the pieces.</p>
 <p>“Silver… it’s really silver. It’s just a damned silver spear!!” Liu Daoyun’s eyes were crimson, and it seemed as if he was about to go berserk. He raised his head to the sky and let out a ferocious roar. He was humiliated, and furious. He had killed Sun Hua; had the spear actually been a treasured item, it would not have been a huge problem. But he had killed a Winding Stream Inner Sect disciple over a simple silver spear…. This could cause a huge conflagration between two great Sects.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao!!” He wanted to chase after him, but Meng Hao had long since disappeared. Zhou and Xu were also furious. And while they felt indignation toward Meng Hao, Sun Hua had been killed by Liu Daoyun. They couldn’t just let him go.</p>
