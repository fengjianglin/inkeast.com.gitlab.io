 <p><strong>Chapter 442: A Figure Leaping, Sailing Over Three Thousand Cultivators!</strong></p>
 <p>“There’s no need to even think about it,” continued Zhao Youlan. “With a barrier of three thousand Cultivators, he’ll get tangled up before he can even get close to me. Unless he can perform minor teleportation, it won’t do him any good. Even relying on that Blood Qi art won’t get him across such a distance!</p>
 <p>“If he flew, it would require incredible speed to break through three thousand Cultivators. Having seen his speed just now, I can tell it’s not sufficient.” It was at this point in her train of thought that Zhao Youlan saw Meng Hao lift his head up and let out a long cry.</p>
 <p>In response to the cry, the Wild Giant came running. It roared as its muscles swelled and its body grew to the height of three hundred meters. The muscles on its right arm began to writhe, as if all the blood in its entire body was being collected there. The arm continued to grow in a bizarre and exaggerated way; soon it comprised more than half of the Wild Giant’s entire body!</p>
 <p>The arm was completely out of proportion to the rest of its body. Blue veins popped up all over the surface of the arm, and it looked like it was almost about to explode. There appeared to be terrifying physical power filling the arm. The sight of it was completely shocking. The Wild Giant snatched up Meng Hao with its arm and hurled him into the air in the direction of Zhao Youlan.</p>
 <p>All of the fearsome power contained in the body of the Wild Giant was now transferred to Meng Hao, causing him to shoot through the air like a lightning bolt. As he sped through the air, the power of the Wild Giant bolstered his innate speed, causing his figure to rip through the air… like a blazing sun!</p>
 <p>At the same time, a cloud of Demonsquitos circled around him, transforming into a vortex. Black crows also approached, turning into a mist. The red crocodile also approached, becoming a giant wing. The enormous lizard transformed into a body, and the Black Bat became another wing. Meng Hao’s speed once again increased explosively as the neo-demon horde pushed him forward.</p>
 <p>A shocking drone spread out in all directions as Meng Hao shot through the sky surrounded by his vast neo-demon horde. He sailed over the three thousand Cultivators, who stared up, their minds spinning, too shocked to react. It was at this time that…</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s neo-demon horde transformed into a long, sharp arrow, with Meng Hao as the arrowhead. They shot forward, filled with the desire to kill and emanating fierce killing intent. It was with explosive speed that they shot through the sky toward Zhao Youlan, seemingly capable of ripping open the Heavens.</p>
 <p>In this moment, the members of the Five Tribes within the shield couldn’t even breathe. The Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather, now recovered from his injuries, stared with wide, bloodshot eyes. The other seven Nascent Soul Cultivators next to him were panting.</p>
 <p>In this moment, three thousand Spider Branch Cultivators watched on with red eyes that were filled with shock.</p>
 <p>In this moment, the expressions of the Nascent Soul Elders outside of the shield, as well as of the High Priest, completely changed!</p>
 <p>Zhao Youlan’s phoenix like eyes went wide and she began to pant as she stared at Meng Hao. In this moment, Meng Hao’s figure could be seen reflected in her eyes as it was burned deeply into her mind and heart.</p>
 <p>A figure leaping, sailing over three thousand Cultivators,</p>
 <p>A demonic arrow, shooting directly toward Zhao Youlan!</p>
 <p>The incredible speed made the over one thousand meter distance between the two of them suddenly less than three hundred! The Cultivators with the green tattoos who surrounded Zhao Youlan braced themselves to contend with this formidable foe. Killing intent could be seen in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Zhao Youlan held the Exotic Heartdevil Flower up above her head. As she stared at Meng Hao, her expression grew calm, and her eyes filled with coldness. At the moment, she couldn’t move. If she did, it would cause the power of the Exotic Heartdevil Flower to dissipate. Once that happened, the remaining Five Tribes Cultivators within the shield would charge out. Including the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather, that would be eight Nascent Soul Cultivators, more than enough to entangle the Spider Branch Elders.</p>
 <p>Such a circumstance would put them in truly grave danger.</p>
 <p>“I bet… he won’t make it!” thought Zhao Youlan, her heart filling with decisiveness.</p>
 <p>The rest of the Spider Branch Elders now abandoned their attempts to destroy the shield and exterminate the Five Tribes. More important to them was their Branch’s Holy Daughter.</p>
 <p>Three of the nine Elders immediately teleported toward Meng Hao, their bodies exploding with power. The other six began to fly forward without hesitation.</p>
 <p>The three Elders suddenly appeared next to Meng Hao’s shocking figure. They immediately began to perform incantation gestures, causing totemic light to spring out from their bodies. It transformed into a massive, illusive figure which shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Back off, you!” The growling roar of the three Nascent Soul Cultivators was like thunder.</p>
 <p>“Screw off!” replied Meng Hao, accompanied by a howl that sounded like the combination of the howling of all the neo-demons that surrounded him. The sound of it shook Heaven and Earth, and pressed down onto the three Nascent Soul Cultivators. Suddenly, the flock of black crows, the cloud of Demonsquitos, as well as the red crocodile all changed direction and shot toward the three.</p>
 <p>Amidst the thunderous roaring, Meng Hao continued onward, not pausing even a tiny bit. The neo-demon horde obstructed the path of the three Nascent Soul Cultivators, allowing Meng Hao to pass by them unhindered.</p>
 <p>He was now only about two hundred meters from Zhao Youlan!</p>
 <p>Furious roars could now be heard as the other six Nascent Soul Elders appeared near Meng Hao. They employed the full power of their Cultivation bases, causing totemic divine abilities to manifest. Roaring filled the air as the power of these six men combined to create an enormous golden bell that shot toward Meng Hao, preparing to crush him.</p>
 <p>As the golden bell flew forward, massive pressure filled the air, along with an ear-splitting rumble. Meng Hao’s eyes glittered as he suddenly waved out with both hands. Big Hairy and the gigantic lizard, as well as all of the other neo-demons, shot through the air toward the incoming golden bell.</p>
 <p>From a distance, Meng Hao’s neo-demon horde appeared to transform into something like a black wind that swept out from his body. Now Meng Hao was completely visible there in mid-air.</p>
 <p>Without hesitation, he lifted his right hand up, within which appeared a blood-colored mask. He slipped it onto his face, and a rumbling sound could be heard as a shapeless Blood Qi exploded out from his body. It shot out in all directions, completely shocking all the onlookers.</p>
 <p>The Blood Qi billowed out, transforming into an enormous red vortex with Meng Hao in the middle, flashing an incantation gesture. Suddenly, the rapidly spinning vortex changed into the image of a face.</p>
 <p>The face shot out from behind the neo-demon horde, directly toward the golden bell and the six Nascent Soul Cultivators.</p>
 <p>A massive, shocking boom shook everything. The neo-demon horde scattered and the golden bell shattered. The faces of six men immediately turned pale with astonishment as they retreated backward.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao spat some blood out of his mouth; his speed now increased as he Bloodburst Flashed away from the six Nascent Soul Cultivators to appear only a hundred meters away from Zhao Youlan. The two of them could see each other very clearly, even down to the threads in their clothing.</p>
 <p>Zhao Youlan’s expression was the same as ever, and her eyes were filled with coldness. Even Meng Hao had to admire such a mental state. However, his killing intent grew even thicker as he flickered toward her through the air.</p>
 <p>The more than ten Cultivators with green totem tattoos immediately shot forward, transforming into a green light that charged toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Zhao Youlan’s expression didn’t change in the least as she looked at Meng Hao approaching her. She saw his mask, his green robe rippling in the wind, and his white hair whipping in the wind. But her eyes were like deep, still waters, filled with coldness.</p>
 <p>Surrounded by an army of thousands, he had come alone. Nine Nascent Soul Elders were incapable of hindering him in the slightest. The image of a person like this would forever be imprinted in Zhao Youlan’s heart.</p>
 <p>You could say that in terms of this great battle between Tribes, Zhao Youlan had calculated all possibilities. The only thing she hadn’t calculated… was Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao raised a fist and slammed it into the chest of one of the green-faced Cultivators. The man’s Cultivation base was immediately suppressed. His body didn’t explode immediately. Instead he was thrown backward, where he slammed into the person behind him and they both exploded into a cloud of blood and gore.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s body flickered, and he reappeared behind another of the Cultivators. He didn’t strike out. Instead, he flashed an incantation gesture, and sounds rang out like the crunching of bones. A golden light appeared, and three of the people were instantly transformed into statues of gold.</p>
 <p>Efficient, clean extermination, without any messiness. Having accomplished this, Meng Hao took a deep breath and increased his speed, passing through the surviving five Cultivators as he closed in on Zhao Youlan.</p>
 <p>The surviving green-faced Cultivators let out successive roars, their eyes filling with determination as they opted to… self-detonate!</p>
 <p>Booms filled the air as five Cultivators of the great circle of Core Formation exploded. Such power would cause even Meng Hao to be shocked if it hit him. However, his expression didn’t change in the least bit. Even as the power of the self-detonation swept toward him, layers of silk threads appeared around him. This was… Eyeless Larva silk!</p>
 <p>The silk whistled through the air as it surrounded Meng Hao. The silk was indestructible, therefore, Meng Hao sustained no injuries. He shot onward like lightning, bursting out from within the self-detonation explosions. He was now only thirty meters away from Zhao Youlan.</p>
 <p>By this point, everyone in the area was completely astonished!</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that a tall figure suddenly appeared in front of him. Something like a green boulder and a black wooden branch seemed to step out from the void. A wand pointed toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Begone!” The voice was archaic and booming, and belonged to none other than the High Priest of the Spider Branch. He glared at Meng Hao, gripping a wand in his hand that contained power seemingly sufficient to crush mountains. Meng Hao was incapable of dodging, and the power of the wand slammed into the silk of the Eyeless Larva.</p>
 <p>His eyes flickered as the nine Nascent Soul Elders behind him managed to shake off the neo-demon hordes and close in on him with murder in their eyes.</p>
 <p>When Zhao Youlan saw the High Priest appear, she heaved a sigh of relief. The fact that Meng Hao had made it within thirty meters of her had filled her with an unprecedented sense of crisis.</p>
 <p>A boom filled the air and Meng Hao’s body trembled as the silk of the Eyeless Larva continuously fought back against the explosive power of the mid Nascent Soul Cultivation base power from the High Priest. Blood seeped out of the corners of Meng Hao’s mouth and he was forced to retreat several paces.</p>
 <p>However, that was the extent of it; a bit of blood seeping out, and a retreat of a few steps. This was all that happened in the face of an onslaught from the full power of a mid Nascent Soul stage attack.</p>
 <p>The Spider Branch High Priest’s pupils constricted.</p>
 <p>“Just what magical item is that!? Well, it doesn’t matter how powerful your magical item is, if you think you can get past me, you’re dreaming!”</p>
