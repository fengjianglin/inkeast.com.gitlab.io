 <p><strong>Chapter 1366: Advancing the Decisive Battle!</strong></p>
 <p>Out in the starry sky, the two Outsider Paragons, Xuan Fang and Mythdragon, looked shocked. Mythdragon was hesitating, but Xuan Fang merely sighed, and a cold gleam appeared in his eyes as he pointed a finger up toward the land mass that was the 5th Heaven.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist Mythdragon, please lend me a hand once more.”</p>
 <p>Mythdragon sighed within his cloak of darkness. “Fine, I'm useless when it comes to strategy. Just tell me what to do.” With that he rotated his cultivation base, whereupon a faint roar like that of a dragon echoed out. At the same time, numerous faint, shadowy forms appeared and began to swirl around him as he helped Xuan Fang set the 5th Heaven in motion.</p>
 <p>The huge land mass that was the 5th Heaven emitted enormous rumbling sounds, and then began to crush down toward the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the power of the eighteen Imperial Lord corpses was erupting out. Their discarnate souls were burning away, allowing incredible power of Heaven and Earth to be directed toward the 3rd Heaven.</p>
 <p>Massive rumbling sounds echoed out, and brilliant colors flashed. Cracks began to spread out across the 3rd Heaven, and soon it began to crumble and collapse.</p>
 <p>The eighteen corpses transformed into eighteen beams of blade-like light that shot toward the 4th Heaven. Shockingly, as they closed in on the land mass that was the 4th Heaven, they chose... to self-detonate!</p>
 <p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p>
 <p>The eighteen corpses used the last bit of life force they had to explode. The starry sky vibrated, and the 4th Heaven, unable to avoid the blast, was hit head on. In the blink of an eye... the entire land mass... crumbled! Unable to maintain a solid form, it shattered and then... transformed into smoke and ash!</p>
 <p>Even as the crumbling fragments of the 3rd Heaven continued to fall down toward the Mountain and Sea Realm, several beams of sword light suddenly appeared from down below. Suddenly... nine swords shot out from within the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p>
 <p>Converged upon those nine swords was the wills of the cultivators of the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto of their respective Mountain and Sea. Precious treasures from the Paragon Immortal Realm, they slashed out toward the fragments of the 3rd Heaven, completely destroying them!</p>
 <p>The brilliant sword light which filled the Mountain and Sea Realm caused everything else to grow dark.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao still stood there on the sun, watching as all of this happened, his heart pounding with excitement. At the same time, the land mass that was the 5th Heaven was still under the control of Xuan Fang and Mythdragon as it smashed down toward the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>“We need to force the Mountain and Sea Realm to pull out everything they have. The 7th Heaven and above can’t join the battle, but they can see what's happening....” Xuan Fang’s eyes glittered as he drew upon all of his cultivation base to send the 5th Heaven in after the 3rd and 4th Heaven.</p>
 <p>The 5th Heaven was far larger than all the previous Heavens, and as soon as it began to descend, the starry sky was crushed. Massive rifts snaked out everywhere, and yet at the same time, an old man suddenly flew out from the First Mountain.</p>
 <p>That old man had the demeanor of a transcendent being, but if you looked closely, you would see that he was actually transparent. He was illusory, and not real. Even as he appeared, the sound of scriptures being chanted could be heard echoing out from the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite temples in the Nine Mountains of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>The chanting filled the entire Mountain and Sea Realm, and a strange power rose up, almost like a summoning. Apparently, it was that illusory old man who was being summoned.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao instantly recognized him. It was the same old man who had given sermons on the Dao back when he himself had been in that abandoned temple of the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite, the same man who could write the character Immortal 仙 into the air with his finger.</p>
 <p>Now, that old man floated out into the void as if he had been transported from ancient times into the present. Mixed emotions could be seen on his face, and he sighed as he extended his hand, pushing it toward the incoming 5th Heaven.</p>
 <p>That simple motion caused the entire 5th Heaven land mass to shudder to a stop. Then... to Meng Hao’s complete disbelief, the entire land mass began to dissolve, transforming into nothing more than ash.</p>
 <p>It happened too quickly for anyone to even react. A simple gesture by that old man caused the land mass that was the 5th Heaven to... completely vanish.</p>
 <p>Then, the figure of the old man began to fade away. At the same time, countless cultivators in the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite temples in the Mountain and Sea Realm coughed up blood, the price that they had to pay for the summoning.</p>
 <p>“Imperial Lord corpses. Deadly Dao Realm treasures. Paragon projections.... The Mountain and Sea Realm’s resources run incredibly deep!” Xuan Fang stared at the disappearing old man from the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite, then took a deep breath, whereupon his eyes flickered with a gleam of madness.</p>
 <p>“We won’t be able to drag this fight out until the 7th Heaven and the others arrive. Fellow Daoist Mythdragon, as of this moment, we have only one choice... put everything on the line, lest the both of us perish this day!” Xuan Fang rose to his feet, then looked in the direction of the 6th Heaven, and stamped his foot down viciously.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the 6th Heaven began to tilt onto its side. Paragon Mythdragon stood there silently, sighing. He knew that the battle had been lost, and that it was because of him. Therefore, without any hesitation, he also stamped his foot down, his eyes flickering with killing intent.</p>
 <p>The land mass that was the 6th Heaven emitted rumbling sounds as it slowly began to move toward the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>“The combined power unleashed by five of our land masses is not enough to break through even their first line of defense,” said Xuang Fang. Based on the resources the Mountain and Sea Realm has at hand... we aren’t well enough prepared to win.</p>
 <p>“However, I refuse to only use part of what we have at our disposal. Fellow Daoist Mythdragon, we must hold nothing back. Let us see... if we can break through this line of defense! Let us see if the Mountain and Sea Realm has any tricks left to defend themselves....</p>
 <p>“The more resources they draw on now, the easier it will be for the 7th Heaven and the others to prepare to counter them in the months to come. That will lead to the Mountain and Sea Realm being defeated in even more expeditious fashion.” Xuan Fang’s eyes glittered coldly as he and Mythdragon sent the 6th Heaven barreling toward the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the final division of millions of Outsiders followed the directions imparted by Xuan Fang’s divine will, surrounding the 6th Heaven, joining it to crash into the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>The decisive battle... was being fought ahead of schedule!</p>
 <p>It only took a moment for the Mountain and Sea Realm to brace itself. Even as the 6th Heaven began to descend, the 100,000 Sea Dragons beneath the Nine Seas God World gate roared and flew up to meet it.</p>
 <p>However, as they closed in, killing intent flickered within the eyes of Paragon Mythdragon of the 6th Heaven. He waved his right hand viciously through the air, and the howl of a dragon could be heard coming from the darkness which surrounded him. Suddenly, an evil, pitch-black dragon roared out, fully 30,000 meters long. Its appearance instantly caused Heaven and Earth to shake violently, and elicited a howl of rage from the 100,000 Sea Dragons.</p>
 <p>The explosive roaring sounds caused everything to shake, and at the same time, Paragon Mythdragon erupted with Paragon power. After all, despite not being adept at strategy, he was very adept... at slaughter!</p>
 <p>As soon as he waved his hand, the roaring of the evil black dragon caused the Sea Dragons to begin to tremble. In the blink of an eye, their flesh was flayed off of their bodies, and they were transformed into bones, which then collapsed into ash.</p>
 <p>The black, evil dragon then shot toward the gate of the Nine Seas God World.</p>
 <p>However, it was at this point that the gate suddenly slammed open, and an enormous, 30,000-meter Sea Dragon flew out. This Sea Dragon had no flesh, and was made completely of bone!</p>
 <p>As soon as it flew out, the shattered bits of flesh and blood from the other Sea Dragons, as well as the ash from their bones, instantly flew over to cover the bones of the gigantic Sea Dragon. Now that it had a body of flesh and blood, it charged toward the evil dragon, roaring.</p>
 <p>At this point, Paragon Sea Dream flew out to join the Paragon puppet, which was still under Meng Hao’s control. Meng Hao also sped out of the sun and headed toward the battlefield.</p>
 <p>The nine swords from the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto then ripped through the void toward the 6th Heaven land mass.</p>
 <p>Further in the depths of the Mountain and Sea Realm, the sound of chanting scriptures once again rose up from the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite. This time, a middle-aged man appeared out of thin air. His eyes were blank, and he held a long spear in his hand. He instantly stepped forward and began to slaughter the Outsiders.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Paragon Mythdragon took a step forward, transforming into three incarnations, one of which headed toward Paragon Sea Dream, and the other toward the Paragon puppet.</p>
 <p>The last incarnation became a black beam of light that sped toward the nine swords. The black light around him shattered, transforming into a hail of shrapnel that spiraled toward the nine swords, then reformed into a sealing field which trapped them.</p>
 <p>Without the black light cloaking him, Paragon Mythdragon was now revealed for all to see. He was huge, with three heads, two of which had their eyes closed. The eyes of the middle head glowed with bright red light as he stared toward the middle-aged man whom the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite had summoned.</p>
 <p>Soon, the glow of magical techniques rose up into the sky.</p>
 <p>As all of that was happening, Xuan Fang began to pick up speed as he headed toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>With all the main powerhouses of the Mountain and Sea Realm locked down, there was no way to stop the 6th Heaven. A massive boom echoed out as it slammed into the First Mountain. The mountain trembled, and cracking sounds emanated out as crevices were ripped open. Then, the land mass continued to smash down into the First Mountain until... it was completely obliterated!</p>
 <p>By this point, most of the land mass that was the 6th Heaven was destroyed. Endless amounts of rubble then began to rain destructively toward the rest of the Mountain and Sea Realm. Instantly, the spell formations of the Second Sea were activated, causing the Second Sea to collapse as it blocked the falling rubble.</p>
 <p>Mountains were being crushed and Seas were being obliterated!</p>
 <p>Even as the Second Sea collapsed to block the rubble raining down, Ksitigarbha was sitting cross-legged on the moon. When his eyes opened, they glowed with icy coldness, and he immediately activated the defensive shield, despite the injuries inflicted upon himself by doing so.</p>
 <p>A glittering shield appeared above the Second Mountain, upon which smashed the remnants of the falling rubble, which then turned into ash.</p>
 <p>No further destruction was carried out; the danger posed by the 6th Heaven was neutralized!</p>
 <p>“That’s it...?” Xuan Fang said, sighing. Behind him, the final division of Outsiders was charging into the Mountain and Sea cultivators. Instantly, fierce fighting broke out. At the same time, complete silence filled everything behind the Second Mountain. No more special methods or techniques were unleashed. “Still don't feel the need to use more of their reserves? Well, in that case....”</p>
 <p>Xuan Fang performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and pointed in Meng Hao’s direction. However, just when Meng Hao was about to make a move, Xuan Fang pulled back, laughing.</p>
 <p>“I don’t care what methods the 7th Heaven or all the other Heavens have at their disposal, they’re not going to be here any time soon. Therefore... since the Mountains and Seas won’t reveal any of its other resources, then... this kid, and that sun and moon, must be destroyed!</p>
 <p>“Activate the Immortal-Imprisoning Formation!!”</p>
