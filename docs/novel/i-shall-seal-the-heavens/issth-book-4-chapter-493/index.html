 <p><strong>Chapter 493: I Will Give You War!</strong></p>
 <p>The sound echoed out like thunder throughout Heaven and Earth. As it did, a three thousand meter long gigantic viper appeared flying through the air!</p>
 <p>Standing on top of the viper were several thousand Cultivators. Their eyes flickered with cold glows. This was the Crow Divinity Tribe who, after years of warfare, had been forged into cold-blooded warriors.</p>
 <p>None of them spoke a single word. From the elderly to the children, all of them wore grim expressions, ruthless and bloodthirsty. They stared out coldly at the Cultivators of the Eight Branch Alliance….</p>
 <p>It was obvious that there were only a few thousand of them. But when the Cultivators of the Eight Branch Alliance looked at them, they seemed like an army of tens of thousands. The closer they came, the more obvious it was that the Crow Divinity Tribe was surrounded by a killing intent that could rock Heaven and Earth!</p>
 <p>This intense killing intent was an invisible aura that could manifest after countless enemies had been killed. The fire and blood that had been experienced by the Crow Divinity Tribe had lit a burning madness in them that seemed on the verge of shaking the entire Western Desert.</p>
 <p>“Who are they? What Tribe is that?!”</p>
 <p>“For a whole Tribe to look like that is something that will never last long in the Western Desert, not even in the Central region. Such character is difficult to forge!”</p>
 <p>“They… could it be… don’t tell me it’s caused by the Demon Spirit!?!?”</p>
 <p>The sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators looked over, faces filled with shock. The Crow Divinity Tribe obviously only had a few thousand Cultivators, but their aura was incredibly intense. The killing intent they emanated was too strong, making the Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators feel as if they were being suffocated.</p>
 <p>This… was the Crow Divinity Tribe!</p>
 <p>They had experienced the fires of war, had been bathed by the flames into a rebirth! A new Crow Divinity Tribe!</p>
 <p>The viper flew through the air at top speed. Originally, they should have taken one day longer before arriving. However, the Crow Divinity Tribe had pushed with full force to increase their speed and arrive a day earlier. In the blink of an eye, they were suddenly here!</p>
 <p>A man stood on the head of the enormous viper, in front of the Crow Divinity Cultivators. When the Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators saw him, in their hearts, they felt as if they were looking at a god of death.</p>
 <p>He wore a green robe, and more than a few white hairs could be seen in his black, floating hair. He emanated the air of a scholar, and yet, his eyes were sharp and cold. His face was as cold as ice, making his aura bizarre to the extreme. It almost seemed as if his entire body was filled with the cold of winter.</p>
 <p>His mere presence could cause everything to freeze over. This man was the well-spring of the Crow Divinity Tribe’s killing intent. If you likened the Crow Divinity tribe to the blood which stains a sharp blade, then this man… would be the sharp tip of that blade!</p>
 <p>This… was Meng Hao!</p>
 <p>His appearance instantly caused the sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators to begin to pant. Their eyes went wide, and their hearts filled with an instinctual fear. They felt as if they were being submerged by floodwaters as they realized that they recognized his face! His face looked exactly the same as the Mist Clone that they had just killed!</p>
 <p>The scene instantly caused the minds of the sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators to explode with roaring.</p>
 <p>The faces of eight Greatfathers instantly fell. Eight High Priests began to pant. Among their number, Ou Yunzai’s pupils constricted. Next to him, the man who looked like a scholar was filled with trepidation. As for the woman in the Lady’s garment, her face was filled with disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Who are you people?!” These words were uttered by one of the two most powerful of the sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators. They echoed out with thunderous power, along with a powerful aura. However, the pressure of this aura could do nothing to suppress the billowing killing intent of the Crow Divinity Tribe.</p>
 <p>“We are the Crow Divinity Tribe!” The voices of thousands of members of the Crow Divinity Tribe joined together to roar back in response. The sound of their roar turned into a sound wave even more powerful than thunder and lightning. It shot out from the gigantic viper as they descended upon the Eight Branch Alliance. It echoed out in all directions, shaking the Heavens with such loudness that nothing could compare!</p>
 <p>It was as if some shocking giant had let out an enormous shout. A gale force wind sprang up, transforming into an attack which rippled out and sent the mist in the area into chaos.</p>
 <p>Even as the roar of the Crow Divinity Tribe rang out, the gigantic viper emitted a cry. The thousands of Crow Divinity Tribe members instantly turned into beams of colourful light that spread out in the air. From down on the ground, the sight of it would make one think of the expression “the Celestial Beauty Scattering Flowers.” Except, these flowers were the color of blood, making it seem as if what was being scattered were spattered drops of blood! [1. This is a Chinese idiom that comes from a Buddhist story of a Celestial/Immortal woman who throws out flower petals to test the moral character of Buddhists. Later it came to be used to describe things floating in the air. There is some really cool wordplay here because the word for “spattered drops of blood” is literally “blood flowers.” There are lots of artistic depictions which you can <a href="http://cn.bing.com/images/search?q=%E5%A4%A9%E5%A5%B3%E6%95%A3%E8%8A%B1&amp;FORM=HDRSC2" target="_blank">see here</a>]</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A massacre started instantly as the thousands of Crow Divinity Tribe members shot down into battle. They had long since grown used to war, to blood, and to slaughter.</p>
 <p>In war, there is no speaking. There is no cursing. There are no faceoffs. There is only… fighting!</p>
 <p>As the Crow Divinity Tribe members charged into battle, Meng Hao whistled through the air like a meteor as he lead the Crow Divinity Tribe’s six Nascent Soul Cultivators to stab directly into the midst of the sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators of the Eight Branch Alliance.</p>
 <p>One of late Nascent Soul Cultivators among the sixteen, an old man, grimly said, “A trifling few thousand. Even if you have some extraordinary qualities, the fact that you dare to come here shows that you truly overestimate your…”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish speaking, Meng Hao, looking all the bit a shooting star, waved his right hand, causing all of the Nascent Soul Cultivators, as well as their fellow Tribe members below, to gasp.</p>
 <p>60,000 roaring neo-demons spread out to blot out the sky. Big Hairy, the lizard, the red crocodile, the black crows, the green mosquitos, as well as a vast collection of Five Poisons neo-demons, shook the Heavens.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the furiously howling Outlander Beast appeared. A shrill, frenzied squawk could be heard which was the parrot, emanating his haughty air. A garrulous chatter could also be heard coming from somewhere within the neo-demon horde, which was the meat jelly.</p>
 <p>The shocking neo-demon horde shot through the air like a tide of beasts, sweeping over everything.</p>
 <p>The scene was like a sledgehammer that slammed into the hearts of the Eight Branch Alliance.</p>
 <p>“Life or death is on the line. Eight Branches, COUNTERATTACK!” These words were uttered by the red-robed late Nascent Soul stage Cultivator who had just spoken. His face flickered, and his heart filled with regret. However, there was nothing else to be done. He could only let out a furious roar as he shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators immediately began to perform incantation gestures as they teleported toward Meng Hao. The glow of magical items rose up around them, as well as savage magical faces. The faces howled as they shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>However, even as they neared, Meng Hao waved his hand. A blood-colored mask suddenly appeared, which he quickly slipped onto his face. He waved his hand again, and an enormous face suddenly materialized around him.</p>
 <p>The giant face bore the semblance of none other than Meng Hao himself!</p>
 <p>The instant the face appeared, Meng Hao took a step forward. That step caused everything to tremble; the giant Blood Immortal face that now looked like Meng Hao rumbled forward, transforming into a massive attack. Everything shook; of the sixteen Nascent Soul Cultivators, ten could only watch as their magical items shattered into pieces and their divine abilities were crushed. Blood sprayed from their mouths as they were tossed back like kites with their strings cut.</p>
 <p>“The great circle of the Nascent Soul stage!!” Shock filled the faces of these ten people, and they didn’t even have the wherewithal to wipe the blood from their mouths.</p>
 <p>“You are the ones… who killed my clone!” said Meng Hao coolly. He continued forward, taking a second step. As he did, the gigantic face appeared again. Its closed eyes suddenly opened, and it seemed to be speaking a single, soundless word!</p>
 <p>As soon as the word appeared, the other six Nascent Soul Cultivators who remained felt blood pouring out of their mouths. Their minds reeled as if a sharp blade were being stabbed into their brains. The soundless sound wave passed through their minds, causing their entire bodies to shake. Life force essence was even squeezed out of their Nascent Souls.</p>
 <p>“He’s halfway to Spirit Severing!” Four of them coughed up blood as they were sent tumbling backward, bodies shaking. Dread washed over them, and intense astonishment filled their eyes.</p>
 <p>“If you want to do business, Meng Hao will do business with you. If you want war… then I will give you war!” Meng Hao’s voice was cold as he took a third step. This third step caused flames to spring up on the bodies of the ten Nascent Soul Cultivators who had been thrown backward moments ago. Writhing black smoke began to emanate off of their bodies. The flames of war were now burning away at their life forces.</p>
 <p>Even the most powerful of the Eight Branch Alliance, the two old men with the late Nascent Soul Cultivation base, felt their ears ringing. Although they were not sent tumbling back, their minds were filled with waves of roaring, and flames of war appeared on their bodies too.</p>
 <p>“Flames of war unify!” The instant Meng Hao spoke the words, a sound like thunder exploding into pieces suddenly rose up. The ten people who were farthest away emit bloodcurdling screams as their bodies exploded. Their Nascent Souls emerged, fearfully trying to flee at the highest speed they could muster. However, before they could barely move at all, they fell to pieces as if they had been crushed.</p>
 <p>A cold wind swept over them, and they disappeared.</p>
 <p>Ou Yunzi, the man dressed like the scholar, and the woman in the Lady’s robe all felt their bodies collapsing in a cloud of blood and gore. Their Nascent Souls managed to flee off into the distance, where they looked back toward Meng Hao, shaking with fear, their eyes filled with despair.</p>
 <p>The two old men of the late Nascent Soul stage had the highest Cultivation bases, but even they coughed up blood and fell backward, bodies shaking as they did their best to prevent from exploding.</p>
 <p>Their tens of thousands of fellow Tribe members had originally occupied a position of superiority. But facing up against 60,000 neo-demons caused them to immediately begin to suffer defeat after defeat in the fighting. They had their own neo-demons of course. However, like Meng Hao’s Crow Divinity Tribe, his neo-demons had experienced figurative foul winds and rains of blood. Furthermore, they had been bolstered by Meng Hao’s Demonic Qi on multiple occasions. The neo-demons of the Eight Branch Alliance simply couldn’t compare.</p>
 <p>Mournful cries filled the air constantly. The land was soaked with blood. Facing up against the Crow Divinity Tribe, the Eight Branch Alliance despairingly found… that they were incapable of fighting back.</p>
 <p>Regardless if it was terms of aura or Cultivation base, they were weaker. When it came to the coldness and bloodthirstiness of the Crow Divinity Tribe, that was something that only the elite members of great Tribes would have. And yet, every single member of the Crow Divinity Tribe was like that.</p>
 <p>It was something the Cultivators of the Eight Branch Alliance had never seen or even heard of. They couldn’t even imagine that in the great lands of the Western Desert, a Tribe like this could possibly exist!</p>
 <p>“This is… a Battle Tribe!”</p>
 <p>It was in this moment that Meng Hao’s words from moments ago once again echoed out within the minds of the Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators.</p>
 <p>“If you want war, I’ll give you war!”</p>
