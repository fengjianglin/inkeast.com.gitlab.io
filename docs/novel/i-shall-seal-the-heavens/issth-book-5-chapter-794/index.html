 <p><strong></strong></p>
 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, out on the Milky Way Sea, the enormous Resurrection Lily was shrinking in on itself. The petals folded up into a bulb, and the tentacle roots weaved together to form the shape of a Blue Lotus!</p>
 <p>The Blue Lotus swayed back and forth, and although it appeared to be in full bloom, there also seemed to be something missing, as if it was unstable and could revert to the shape of a Resurrection Lily at any time.</p>
 <p>“The gap between Immortal and Devil has appeared….”</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>On the battlefield in the Southern Domain, the crowds were crying out with loud voices. The Northern Reaches cultivators stood there ashen-faced as the great Dao blade slowly faded away.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the state of motionlessness which had been imposed on everyone gradually disappeared. However, no fierce fighting broke out. The Northern Reaches forces began to form up in groups. Up above, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief let out a roar and transformed into the Primordial Lightning Dragon. Bypassing the three South Cleaving Sentinels in bronze armor, he shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see just how strong you are now that you’re in Dao Seeking!” he roared.</p>
 <p>As the old man neared, killing intent flickered in the other four peak Dao Seeking experts’ eyes. Their cultivation bases burst with power; they knew that their only chance was to attack in unison. If they didn’t do that now, the battle would definitely end in a huge defeat!</p>
 <p>If they could kill Meng Hao now, then… they might have a chance to turn a defeat into a victory!</p>
 <p>Five people closed in at incredible speed.</p>
 <p>“Kill him!”</p>
 <p>“He was already powerful before, so there’s no chance that he won’t be Heaven-defying now that he’s in Dao Seeking. Except, his cultivation base is unstable since he just completed his Third Severing. Kill him now!”</p>
 <p>“Only by killing him can we turn this battle around! We can’t leave him alive!”</p>
 <p>“Kill him before he truly enters Dao Seeking!”</p>
 <p>Those were the thoughts running through their heads as they closed in, roaring.</p>
 <p>The extremely obese woman rumbled through the air, surrounded by colorful streams of mist that transformed into seven hypertoxic strips of paper!</p>
 <p>Each strip was a different color, and each one was covered with countless glittering magical symbols that pulsed with Dao Seeking auras.</p>
 <p>Flying next to her at top speed was the effeminate man whose body emanated shocking coldness. The coldness transformed into an obscene statue that possessed both male and female properties. Furthermore, it emanated a Dao will that seemed to combine the properties of both yin and yang.</p>
 <p>Glittering light spread out, and the effeminate man suddenly began to transform into a woman, extremely beautiful, and yet filled with a murderous aura.</p>
 <p>Of the other two peak Dao Seeking experts, one of them was the old man who looked like a hopping vampire. Suddenly, black fur sprouted out all over his body, and his eyes began to glow with a green light. Cracking sounds could be heard as his body grew larger, and an aura of death surged out from him. Now he looked like a drought ghoul! [1. The “drought ghoul” refers to a mythological creature. Although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCba" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a> indicates that it is a specific person, this kind of creature can be seen in games as a type of enemy creature. Normally it would be “drought demon,” but considering the implications of the word “demon” in the story, I’m going with the word “ghoul.” The character “妖 yao” does not appear in the name of the creature itself]</p>
 <p>He was surrounded by an aura of death, and although he should have emanated yin-type coldness, he actually burned with ghost fire. The ghost fire spread out, its faint glow causing the sun and moon to tremble. Within the flames could be seen countless evil spirits, so many that they blotted out the sky and the land. Rumbling filled the air as they shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The last Dao Seeking expert was the man in the violet robe who had participated in the second wave army’s attack. Despite being seriously injured, he had continued to fight all the way down to this final, decisive battle. He spit up blood, and seemed like an arrow at the end of its flight, completely spent of all energy. Nonetheless, he let out a roar, and his body suddenly grew larger. His features became aged, and in the the blink of an eye, he looked like an old man.</p>
 <p>By sacrificing longevity, he was able to gain earth-shaking power. His body expanded rapidly, and scales grew out to cover his skin. A horn even grew out of his forehead, and a long tail appeared behind him. He now completely resembled a Demon Devil!</p>
 <p>A savage aura burst out, as well as rancid wind. Dust swirled around him in the wind, transforming into a sandstorm that flew directly toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>These four peak Dao Seeking experts went berserk as they unleashed pyrrhic divine abilities that could kill a thousand enemies at the expense of eight hundred allies. As for the number one most powerful person from the Northern Reaches, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, he instantly transformed into a Primordial Lightning Dragon. Thunderous booms filled the air as he shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The five of them swept through everything in their path, as if nothing could possibly block them. They closed in from five different directions, radiating such indescribable power that the air vibrated and everything shook. Not even Pill Demon and the others could block them.</p>
 <p>From the look of it, even a false Immortal would be seriously injured by this allout attack by five peak Dao Seeking experts, in which caution was thrown to the wind!</p>
 <p>Down below, the Southern Domain cultivators’ eyes were shot with blood.</p>
 <p>“Your excellency Meng Hao!!”</p>
 <p>“Not good! Blood Prince Meng Hao just performed his Third Severing and hasn’t had time to stabilize himself! Those damned Northern Reaches cultivators!!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Song’s and Pill Demon’s faces fell. They were just about to risk everything to try to block the Northern Reaches cultivators when all of a sudden, Meng Hao’s voice echoed out.</p>
 <p>“Allow them to come.”</p>
 <p>It was one sentence, with only four words. [1. I can’t always match up the words to the sentences, but in this case it’s the same in Chinese. One sentence, four characters!] They were words spoken with the utmost confidence, such confidence that apparently he didn’t even need to utilize his second true self.</p>
 <p>As soon as those words rang out, the Southern Domain cultivators calmed down.</p>
 <p>No one did anything to block the Northern Reaches cultivators. As for the five peak Dao Seeking experts, rumbling filled the air as they shot through the air in five beams of colorful light.</p>
 <p>“Meng Hao, you’re DEAD!!” they roared.</p>
 <p>As they neared, Meng Hao looked up at them, his face calm in an unparalleled manner. Then he slowly rose to his feet from his cross-legged position.</p>
 <p>The movement only took a moment, but during that time the air around him rumbled as a power exploded up within him that seemed capable of splitting Heaven and Earth apart.</p>
 <p>Shocking thumping sounds filled the air.</p>
 <p>As he stood, the power of natural law descended and the area around Meng Hao filled with streams of ancient magical symbols. They glittered brightly as they formed Meng Hao’s personal natural law of Dao Seeking.</p>
 <p>It was a Dao of freedom, a Dao of good and evil, formed from Meng Hao’s will. It was a law that could transform Heaven and Earth with a single thought.</p>
 <p>When the natural law appeared, the rumbling in the area grew even more shocking. The sky shook as something appeared that seemed to be a mountain. It was not the Ninth Mountain, but rather a lush, green mountain…. It was…</p>
 <p>Mount Daqing! It was also a Dao-confirming mountain!</p>
 <p>As soon as it appeared, it began to shine with brilliant light. Meng Hao took a deep breath and looked down at the mark on his right hand. It was also pulsing with an aura that merged into his body and then transformed into the aura of an Immortal.</p>
 <p>It was Immortal qi!</p>
 <p>After experiencing the mist blade, Immortal qi had appeared on Meng Hao!</p>
 <p>When the Immortal qi appeared, the world trembled. The Northern Reaches cultivators down below were shaking in their boots, and the Southern Domain forces were getting even more excited than before.</p>
 <p>Pill Demon gasped, and then murmured, “Severing the Devil and Seeking the Dao. This is something rare that only exists in legends!!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Song was equally excited.</p>
 <p>Moments before, the peak Dao Seeking experts from the Northern Reaches had a sliver of hope that they might win by a fluke. Now that the Immortal qi had appeared, they gasped, and their minds were sent spinning.</p>
 <p>The five peak Dao Seeking experts from the Northern Reaches were astonished.</p>
 <p>“He just stepped into Dao Seeking and he already developed Immortal qi! Impossible! I’ve been in Dao Seeking for years and still haven’t developed even a scrap!”</p>
 <p>“Just what level of cultivation base does he have! I actually… can’t even clearly make out what his cultivation base is!!”</p>
 <p>“It seems like early Dao Seeking, but at the same time, mid Dao Seeking, and also peak Dao Seeking! What’s going on!?!?”</p>
 <p>“Now that I think about it, there’s a legend about a type of Dao Seeking which isn’t split into multiple levels! As soon as you step into it, you’re at the peak….”</p>
 <p>However, they were already like arrows unleashed from the bow. They had to go through with their attacks; if they didn’t, their fate would certainly be death.</p>
 <p>Considering that retreat meant certain annihilation, then the only course of action they could take… was to attack!</p>
 <p>The five of them closed in on Meng Hao, surrounded by rumbling sounds!</p>
 <p>The fastest of them all was the man who had assumed the shape of a beautiful female cultivator. He was was the first to arrive, surrounded by a shocking cold aura. The matchlessly bizarre statue emanated faint light; it had been refined by the man after he had reached Dao Seeking, by sacrificing some of his his own life force. It could unleash a shocking divine ability.</p>
 <p>“Yin-Yang Nine Tribulations!” the cultivator bellowed, stretching out both hands. His goal was to completely destroy Meng Hao in one shot.</p>
 <p>However, even as he neared, Meng Hao clenched his right fist and punched out. It was a tidy and efficient blow, delivered with indescribable speed. The air was sucked in, and massive energy surged. The beautiful cultivator’s face fell as he sensed an unsurpassable pressure surging toward him like Heavenly might. It was something impossible to contend with, and the amorphous power blasted into him before he even had a chance to retreat.</p>
 <p>BOOOOMMMMM! A huge explosion rattled out.</p>
 <p>The beautiful cultivator was at the peak of Dao Seeking, and was burning life force in an incredible display of power. Despite all of that, blood sprayed from his mouth in a constant stream. The statue shattered into pieces. His body trembled, and then exploded into pieces. His Nascent Divinity sped out, shrieking.</p>
 <p>One punch had completely destroyed a peak Dao Seeking expert who was burning life force!</p>
 <p>The sight caused countless gasps to ring out. At the same time, Meng Hao gave a cold snort. His eyes shone with a strange light as he unexpectedly did not destroy the Nascent Divinity, but instead, slapped his hand out toward the extremely obese woman and her hypertoxic, multicolored strips of paper.</p>
 <p>The slap was calm and even leisurely, almost as if he were swatting a fly. As it neared her, the woman’s eyes went wide and she let out a miserable shriek. She went all out with every scrap of power she had, causing the seven strips of paper to emanate blinding beams of light. Ghost images sprang up from the papers, making them look like a bound book. She placed her hand on the book and shoved it out to meet Meng Hao’s palm.</p>
 <p>BOOOOOOMMMMM!</p>
 <p>A deafening explosion caused everything to shake.</p>
 <p>The book composed of seven pieces of colored paper trembled, and didn’t even manage to stay together for the space of one breath of time. It exploded into swirling confetti, which then became dust. As for the woman, her hypertoxic mist was completely incapable of fazing Meng Hao. She flew backward, blood spurting from her mouth. After ten meters, her arm exploded. After twenty meters, her entire body began to crack. After thirty meters, her body completely exploded.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao did not destroy her Nascent Divinity either, but rather, allowed her to flee, her face filled with with terror and astonishment.</p>
 <p>“And now you,” Meng Hao said coolly, turning to the hopping vampire. He pointed out, and its body began to tremble. A look of despair appeared on its face as the ghost-fire which covered it was immediately extinguished. To Meng Hao, it was so weak it couldn’t withstand a single blow. The man’s Nascent Divinity emerged, surrounded by an aura of death. He looked at Meng Hao, trembling, his eyes shining with intense fear and astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Invincible!! He’s invincible!!”</p>
 <p>Everything was shaking. Of the five peak Dao Seeking Experts, three had just had their fleshly bodies completely destroyed. As for the violet-robed man who looked like a Demon Devil and the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, they were roaring madly as they descended upon Meng Hao, like moths to the flame.</p>
