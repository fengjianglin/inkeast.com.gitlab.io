 <p>“Up to this point, my life consisted of two parts,” Meng Hao murmured.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“The first part was beneath Mount Daqing, along the path of the Imperial examinations…. When I stood on top of Mount Daqing, wrote down my dream and stuffed it into that gourd bottle, then tossed it into the river below, I had no idea…</p>
 <p>“That that very moment represented the beginning of the second part of my life.</p>
 <p>“That second part was cultivation!” Meng Hao stood on the surface of the Violet Sea, wearing a spotless green robe. He did not sink down even a bit into the seawater. Instead, he looked up at the boundless lightning dancing about up above like red serpents. They interlocked, forming Tribulation Clouds.</p>
 <p>“This past hundred years or more of cultivation allowed me to experience death and escape. I have experienced things that the old me would never have been able to experience, walked paths that before, I could never have walked to the end of.</p>
 <p>“As for Heavenly Tribulation… I’ve experienced that too, more than once.</p>
 <p>“This time, I will not be nervous like I was when I experienced the Heavenly Tribulation of the Perfect Foundation. I won’t take it as seriously as the year I faced the Perfect Gold Core Heavenly Tribulation. I’ve been waiting for today’s Heavenly Tribulation… for a long time.” A slight smile suddenly broke out on his face. Even as he murmured the words, a massive rumbling sound roared out from within the Tribulation clouds. At the same time, a red lightning bolt shot down toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>As it neared, even more lightning bolts fused into it. By the time it was about thirty or so meters from Meng Hao’s head, it was as wide as a person’s arm. As it roared toward him, it carried with it the awe-inspiring power of Heavenly Tribulation, a detached desire to destroy.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked up at the incoming Tribulation Lightning. Then, he lifted his right arm and waved it toward the sky. Instantly, life force collided with death will, transforming into a power of extermination that shot toward the lightning bolt.</p>
 <p>A shocking boom filled the Heaven and the sea. The arm’s-width sized lightning bolt instantly collapsed into countless arcs of electricity that scattered about into the air above Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Before, Heavenly Tribulation like this would have destroyed me in both body and soul. Now, however… it doesn’t even qualify to make me enter my Second Anima.” Meng Hao’s expression was the same as ever as he stood there motionless. He then… looked back up at the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s behavior seemed to infuriate the Heavenly Tribulation. The lightning and thunder crashed about in the sky. One red lightning bolt after another began to form together and then fall down. This time, there were four bolts that descended. An earsplitting roar filled the air as the area for thirty meters around Meng Hao was transformed into a lake of lightning.</p>
 <p>Each of the four red beams of lighnting contained enough power to eradicate some of the late Nascent Soul stage. As they fell down, Meng Hao simply stood there and waved his sleeve, allowing the four lightning bolts to strike.</p>
 <p>Red lightning danced around Meng Hao, spreading out across the Violet Sea, filling everything for several hundred meters in each direction.</p>
 <p>As for Meng Hao, he simply stood there in the middle of the lightning, his entire body glowing with electrical light. The light quickly faded. In the space of only a few breaths it was completely gone. Meng Hao’s expression was the same as ever, without even the slightest bit of change.</p>
 <p>Currently, he was in the First Anima of the Six Animas Soul Transformations, with the full power of a peak late Nascent soul. Meng Hao had long since decided that this would be his normal state.</p>
 <p>Although the lightning surrounding him was incredibly powerful and out of the ordinary, it still was incapable of hurting him, despite the fact that he was only in the First Anima.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao gently shook his arms and legs, feeling the power of lightning that had fused into his physical body. He had experienced this feeling in previous encounters with Heavenly Tribulation, so he wasn’t surprised. He looked up, his eyes shining with a bright light.</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, an enormous sound like an enraged roar filled the sky. Eight lightning bolts merged together in the air up above. The Tribulation Clouds seethed and then began to pull back. Thunder boomed as the eight lightning bolts began to fall.</p>
 <p>These eight lightning bolts were bright red, almost like blood. Then fell down with intense destructive power, causing enormous pressure to bear down on Meng Hao. The pressure didn’t cause Meng Hao to fall back, though. Instead, he began to laugh. A Demonic-looking glow radiated from his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Now it’s getting interesting. Second Anima!”</p>
 <p>Of the six Nascent Souls inside Meng Hao, two overlapped and fused together. In the same moment, popping sounds could be heard from within Meng Hao as it swelled out. He grew half a head taller, and in the blink of an eye, he looked bigger than before.</p>
 <p>His majestic aura exploded out, doubling. Now he possessed the battle prowess of two peak late Nascent Souls. Waves kicked up in the Violet Sea around him, sweeping out in all directions. It was as if a whirlwind had erupted out because of Meng Hao entering his Second Anima.</p>
 <p>Laughing, Meng Hao did not retreat, but actually shot up into the air to attack the eight lightning bolts!</p>
 <p>This was not passively reacting to the enemy, but taking the initiative to attack head on!</p>
 <p>A huge boom echoed out as the eight lightning bolts slammed into him. An explosion of lightning burst out for hundreds of meters in every direction. Meng Hao was the center of it all, meeting the full force of the Tribulation lightning head on. He rocketed forward, completely unharmed by the eight lightning bolts. They didn’t even qualify to cause blood to ooze out from his mouth.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Tribulation seemed as if it possessed intelligence, and was currently furious. The sound of thunder filled the air. This time, eighteen red lightning bolts appeared. They looked like eighteen ferocious red dragons as they crackled through the air toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Third Anima!” Meng Hao’s eyes were now surging with an intense desire to fight.</p>
 <p>His body grew again. He was now more than a full head taller and his body more cut and rough. Only a scrap of the aura of a scholar was left, and now, his aura was much more Demonic .</p>
 <p>He flew up, performing an incantation gesture with his right hand as the eighteen lightning bolts fell. Suddenly, a multicolored light spread out, distorting the air as it slammed into the eighteen lightning bolts.</p>
 <p>A huge boom caused everything to shake. Meng Hao laughed as the area for nearly three thousand meters became a maelstrom of lighnting. However, it was powerless to obstruct his path. He continued to shoot upwards, his voice echoing out: “Fourth Anima!”</p>
 <p>Instantly, roaring filled his body as it expanded again. He was now even more brutally powerful, two heads taller than before, his shoulders wide, his frame slender. The scholar’s aura was completely gone, and the Demonic air was growing more intense.</p>
 <p>He gave off the feeling of a Demonic monster; even though he was currently smiling, Meng Hao now looked evil.</p>
 <p>Four Nascent Souls were overlapped and combined, equipping Meng Hao with the power of eight peak late Nascent Souls. He continued to shoot through mid-air toward the Tribulation clouds in the sky.</p>
 <p>Even as Meng Hao increased his speed, the Tribulation clouds roiled. More than twenty bolts of lightning shot down, causing everything to shake, even the sea below. They continuously slammed into Meng Hao, but were incapable of affecting him in any way. His right hand suddenly made a grasping motion in front of him, and an azure Immortal’s Sword appeared there. His left hand slapped his bag of holding, and an alcohol flagon appeared.</p>
 <p>He took a drink, then waved the sword, causing an azure beam of light to flicker out. Bolts of Tribulation Lightning exploded as they hit Meng Hao, causing countless sparks of electricity to fly about flickering into the air. More than a few fused into Meng Hao’s body. Gradually, a will of lightning was building up inside of him.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Tribulation Lightning being formed was no longer just red. More colors were added, a total of seven. They formed into a Seven-Colored Tribulation Lightning. It was one single bolt that seemed capable of ripping the air into pieces, a fierce Seven-Colored Dragon that pounced toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>“Fifth Anima!”</p>
 <p>Shocking popping sounds rang out from his body. He was now two and a half heads taller. His body was far more powerful, and the aura of his battle prowess exploded up. He now possessed power equivalent to sixteen peak late Nascent Souls. The sky and land dimmed, and the clouds seethed.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s body brimmed with incredible power. His hair whipped about and his eyes shone with a strange glow. As the Seven-Colored Heavenly lightning neared, the azure Immortal’s Sword in his hand suddenly shot forward into it.</p>
 <p>The Devil Spear magically appeared in his hand like a fierce dragon. Majestic black mist burst out, along with countless ferocious faces. It followed the azure Immortal’s Sword toward the seven-colored Tribulation Lightning.</p>
 <p>When the two forces slammed into each other, a huge boom could be heard. The seven-colored Tribulation Lightning exploded. The azure Immortal’s Sword was sent spinning. The Devil Spear in Meng Hao’s hand trembled and then exploded with a bang, transforming into a mist that surged out. The mist seethed, then formed back again into the Devil Spear.</p>
 <p>The shattered remnants of the seven colored Tribulation lightning became a seven-colored rain of lightning. It fell down in all directions, many of which fused into Meng Hao’s body. The lightning that was building up inside of him was growing thicker and thicker.</p>
 <p>A tremor ran through him, and blood oozed out of his mouth. He hovered there in mid-air, looking up. Suddenly, the Tribulation clouds began to shrink in on themselves. Seven-colored light spread out as the clouds rapidly began to transform into seven-colored clouds. Furthermore, from within the Tribulation clouds suddenly emerged a…</p>
 <p>Gigantic finger formed from seven-colored lightning!!</p>
 <p>The enormous finger was fully three thousand meters long and completely composed of flickering, seven-colored lightning. Anyone who saw it would be completely astonished. As soon as it appeared, the enormous finger emitted a destructive pressure that bore down on Meng Hao as if it wished to squash him like an insect.</p>
 <p>Even as the finger neared, Meng Hao’s eyes narrowed and he cried, “Sixth Anima!”</p>
 <p>All six Nascent Souls within him were now overlapped and combined. Six colors combined!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>He instantly grew taller, and his body more valiant. His shoulders were wide, his frame slender. There was now no scholar’s aura whatsoever. The only thing he possessed… was breathtaking Demonic evil!</p>
 <p>Beneath him, the Violet Sea roared. The vortex spun, sending crashing waves out. In his Sixth Anima, Meng Hao possessed more over thirty times the power of a peak late Nascent Soul. He now fully deserved to be referred to as the most powerful person under Spirit Severing in the lands of South Heaven!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao kicked down violently into the air. A bang rang out as ripples appeared, and he shot up straight toward the seven-colored finger.</p>
 <p>His right hand clenched violently into a fist. As the finger neared, a fierce glow appeared in his eyes. Then, he…</p>
 <p>Punched!</p>
