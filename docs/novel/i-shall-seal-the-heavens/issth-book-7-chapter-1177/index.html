 <p><strong>Chapter 1177: True Dao Immortal!</strong></p>
 <p>“Allheaven Dao Immortal!!</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” the guardian said hoarsely. “How could there still be an Allheaven Dao Immortal in the Mountain and Sea Realm? Impossible!!” He hadn’t paid any attention to Meng Hao’s azure glow before. After all, there were many Daoist magics and defensive magical items that could cast off green or azure glows. It wouldn’t be realistic to think of Allheaven Immortals every time such a light appeared.</p>
 <p>From what he could recall, Allheaven Dao Immortals were the stuff of legend, and only almighty figures could be counted among their ranks. As a simple guard that had been conscripted into service here, Allheaven Dao Immortals were the type of existence that was far above and beyond his station.</p>
 <p>If Meng Hao weren’t currently engulfed in the sea of flames, shining with an azure light that outshone the Divine Flame, thus provoking a close inspection by the guardian, then he would never have recognized that it was the light of an Allheaven Dao Immortal.</p>
 <p>A cold gleam flickered in Meng Hao’s eyes, and rumbling sounds emanated out from his fleshly body. His cultivation base soared, and his Nirvana Fruit fused more fully into him, thanks to the Divine Flame.</p>
 <p>Soon, he had reached seventy percent!</p>
 <p>Trembling, he threw his head back and roared. The azure light shining off of him grew more scintillating, spreading out in all directions with incredible strength that seemed capable of suppressing the Divine Flame. In fact, the flames shooting toward Meng Hao even paused in place.</p>
 <p>However, no matter how powerful that azure light became, the flame spark inside of Meng Hao continued to pull at the Divine Flame, exerting more force, causing it to move once again. All of the flames in the entire world trembled.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao shook violently within the sea of flames. He was reaching the point where he couldn't hold on much longer. His body was beginning to crack, and the Divine Flame was making it difficult to rotate his cultivation base.</p>
 <p>Were it not for the presence of the azure light, Meng Hao would already be dead.</p>
 <p>“Allheaven Dao!” Meng Hao roared in this critical moment. His third Nirvana Fruit fused even more. More azure light emanated out from him, reaching a distance of thirty meters!</p>
 <p>Within that thirty meters, nothing existed but a world of azure light!</p>
 <p>By now, his third Nirvana Fruit was eighty percent absorbed!!</p>
 <p>Normally speaking, the extra ten percent which had just fused would have taken a month of work. But now, with the burning Divine Flame, the process was completed in a flash. This could be seen as an opportunity for Meng Hao. However, that opportunity was backed by the shadow of death.</p>
 <p>With eighty percent of the power of an Allheaven Dao Immortal, Meng Hao could relax for a moment. His Eternal stratum worked rapidly to heal his life force, and yet even still, he could sense the impending threat of doom from the Divine Flame.</p>
 <p>“You’re going to die for sure!” said the guardian. “Who cares if you’re an Allheaven Dao Immortal? I never imagined that after standing guard here for all these years, I would eventually be able to see an Allheaven Dao Immortal burned alive right in front of me!” The man threw his head back and laughed.</p>
 <p>“You’re getting excited a bit too early,” Meng Hao said in a grating voice. His eyes shone with determination as he extended his right hand and pushed down hard onto his forehead.</p>
 <p>Incredible power surged into his mind, and it was almost as if he were attacking his third Nirvana Fruit. His whole body shook, and he coughed up three mouthfuls of blood. Almost instantly, the blood was scorched into a blood mist, and Meng Hao’s body withered even more. However, he was able to use the power his strike unleashed to further absorb the Nirvana Fruit.</p>
 <p>Ninety percent!!</p>
 <p>Ninety percent of an Allheaven Dao Immortal!</p>
 <p>Azure light exploded around him. No longer did it reach out to 30 meters, but rather, 300 meters, an increase of tenfold. At the same time, Meng Hao’s life force exploded up, and was significantly restored.</p>
 <p>He panted for a moment, then threw his head back and roared, a roar which caused tens of thousands of the surrounding 990,000 pagodas to collapse.</p>
 <p>This development caused the guardian’s face to fall. He stared at Meng Hao in complete shock, almost unable to believe the things that Meng Hao was doing. All of a sudden, his confidence was beginning to waver, and he had the feeling that perhaps... Meng Hao might succeed after all.</p>
 <p>“Impossible,” the man murmured, his eyes filling with a staunch gleam. “The exalted Dao Fang has a towering cultivation base. His curse cannot be broken by anyone in the Mountain and Sea Realm! He said that nobody can acquire this legacy, so therefore, nobody can!”</p>
 <p>“If the curse of Dao Fang really is impossible to break,” Meng Hao said, “well then... what are you guarding, and why does this place even need a guardian!?” He extended his right hand and pushed forward, causing the Divine Flame to seethe and then suddenly stop.</p>
 <p>Within the 300 meters of azure light, not a bit of Divine Flame existed. It had all been expelled outside the perimeter, allowing Meng Hao to finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>His Eternal stratum surged, restoring his body and replenishing his life force. Combined with the power of an Allheaven Dao Immortal, it ensured that Meng Hao’s energy rose higher and higher. Colors flashed up above, and although there was usually no weather in this place, roiling clouds materialized out of nowhere, writhing in the sky.</p>
 <p>An indescribable energy was now rising up from Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>It was nothing more than energy, but it caused the guardian’s face to fall. He began to pant as he looked at Meng Hao, eyes wide. He could sense the soaring rise in Meng Hao’s cultivation base, and it filled him with intense fear.</p>
 <p>The combination of explosive growth in fleshly body and cultivation base at the same time caused incredible pressure to radiate out.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao raised his hand, and the mastiff also began to emanate an azure light. The azure light obeyed Meng Hao’s will, blessing the mastiff, giving it the added protection of an Allheaven Dao Immortal.</p>
 <p>The mastiff let out a long howl of joy, then transformed into a beam of light that shot toward Meng Hao and flew into his bag of holding. Afterward, Meng Hao patted his bag of holding and produced a new set of clothing, which he donned. Then he looked up at the middle-aged guardian.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter if you’re a bit stronger,” the man roared, glaring at Meng Hao, “you still can’t absorb the entire sea of flames. Even if the flame spark can’t kill you, you still won't be able to take it away!”</p>
 <p>“You’re right, I can’t take it away now,” Meng Hao said. “But... I will soon. Don’t worry, I’ll let you watch, and then I’ll close your eyes forever!” With that Meng Hao closed his own eyes.</p>
 <p>Instantly, an azure magical symbol appeared on his forehead, not the Echelon mark, but rather the symbol of an Allheaven Immortal.</p>
 <p>It was circular, and was divided into nine complete sections and one incomplete section. However, that incomplete section was rapidly filling in.</p>
 <p>In the space of a few breaths, the final ten percent of the azure magical symbol began to glow with blinding azure light.</p>
 <p>The light was now several times more intense than before. It... almost looked like an azure sun.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s cultivation base rocketed up with increasing power. Heaven and Earth trembled, and the entire world shook as ripples spread out in all directions.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the numerous pagodas in the world began to collapse one by one under the increasing pressure of Meng Hao’s energy.</p>
 <p>Thousands. Tens of thousands. A hundred thousand. Two hundred thousand....</p>
 <p>As the pagodas collapsed, the whole world descended into rumbling that sounded like screeching roars that emanated from deep underground. Heaven and Earth shook violently, almost as if doomsday had arrived.</p>
 <p>All of that was because of Meng Hao!</p>
 <p>All of that was because Meng Hao was... an Allheaven Dao Immortal!</p>
 <p>The azure light spread out in all directions, and as it did, the Divine Flame shot back to avoid it. In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao was the only person in the entire 3,000-meter area.</p>
 <p>Even the guardian was forced to retreat, feeling more astonished than ever.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s body emanated boundless azure light, as if he were an azure-colored sun. His energy rocketed up, his cultivation base exploded, and he felt more powerful than he ever had in his entire life.</p>
 <p>If he met a Quasi-Dao Guru Heavencloud in his current state, he was completely confident that he could crush him as easily as dried weeds.</p>
 <p>He could even kill... Dao Realm experts, as long as they had 2 Essences or less!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes snapped open, and azure lightning shot out of them, smashing through the void and slamming into the middle-aged guardian's eyes. The lightning smashed his mind, crushing him like a wet branch.</p>
 <p>He screamed miserably, and blood sprayed out of his mouth as he tumbled backward, accompanied by terrifying booms. A single glance forced him backward by seven steps, after which he exploded into bits.</p>
 <p>As his Nascent Divinity flew out, it was clear a single thought on Meng Hao’s part could cause the surrounding azure lightning to destroy him.</p>
 <p>“Like I said, I’m going to let you watch me take away the flame spark,” Meng Hao said coolly, hovering there as if he were the most supreme being in Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>The guardian’s Nascent Divinity trembled in intense fear of Meng Hao. He still almost couldn’t believe that he... who had guarded this land for so long, who had a cultivation base in the great circle of the Ancient Realm, would actually... have his fleshly body destroyed by a single look from Meng Hao. Even his Nascent Divinity could be killed at any moment.</p>
 <p>“Allheaven Dao Immortal... so this... is an Allheaven Dao Immortal!</p>
 <p>“Back in the Paragon Immortal Realm, they weren’t Paragons, and yet, even Paragons had to respect them. No wonder they were called the most terrifying slaughter cultivators.... Allheaven Dao Immortals!!”</p>
 <p>The man’s Nascent Divinity was trembling as he stared at Meng Hao. His mind spun, and he just couldn’t believe that he had actually seen a legendary Allheaven Dao Immortal. Furthermore... it was not an awakening Allheaven Dao Immortal, but a complete, fully awoken, completely powered up...</p>
 <p>Allheaven Dao Immortal!</p>
