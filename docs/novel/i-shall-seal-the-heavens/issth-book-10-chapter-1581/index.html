 <p><strong>Chapter 1581: You Think You Can Ruin Me?!</strong></p>
 <p>Allheaven created something out of nothing, using the mark of the first Transcendor from the starry sky of the Vast Expanse to create what he saw as the perfect body.</p>
 <p>It was none other than... the Ghost Transformation!</p>
 <p>Ghost fire flickered in the eyes of Allheaven’s clone as he transformed. Soon, the clone had become a spectral figure wreathed with Ghost qi. Although his facial features weren’t clearly visible, the sinister aura which emanated off of him filled the entire area.</p>
 <p>It was almost as if he were no longer Allheaven, but instead, another version of Patriarch Vast Expanse.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s pupils constricted. This version of Allheaven was even more powerful than before, and the threatening pressure he exuded was even more intense. However, Meng Hao didn’t hesitate to take the initiative. He flickered as he vanished, reappearing right next to the image of the Ghost, whereupon he lifted his right hand up and then chopped it down.</p>
 <p>The Ghost let out a sinister chuckle, and his body suddenly distorted and began to spin around Meng Hao. Ghost qi erupted out, and within the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged over a thousand blows.</p>
 <p>The starry sky trembled as they fought with blinding speed. Strangely, when Meng Hao’s attacks landed on the Ghost, they passed right through him. It was almost as if they were completely ineffective. Similarly, the Ghost's magical techniques were not able to fully affect Meng Hao. With Meng Hao’s Dao as an Essence, he could affect natural laws, making him as powerful as a mountain.</p>
 <p>At first, it seemed like neither would be able to do much to the other, but then the Ghost's eyes flickered as he performed an incantation gesture. Then he began to speak in bizarre susurrations, deathly utterances that couldn't possibly come from the mouth of a living being.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the starry sky in the area began to fill with more ghostly figures. In the blink of an eye, there were far too many to even count.</p>
 <p>Voices could be heard speaking: “Millions upon millions of vicious ghosts can consume body and soul!”</p>
 <p>The ghosts’ eyes glowed with bizarre light, and their words seemed distorted and twisted, filled with sinister malice. Then the countless ghosts howled shrilly as they began to speed in Meng Hao’s direction.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes widened as the sensation of deadly crisis grew even more intense. Backing up, he let loose his cultivation base power, performing an incantation gesture with his right hand and waving his finger out in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Third Demon Sealing Hex!”</p>
 <p>It was... Present-Ancient Hexing!</p>
 <p>This Hex could manipulate the transformations of Time, making countless eras pass by in the blink of an eye. In a single breath of time, the sky could grow ancient and the lands could become primordial. As the effects of the Hex spread out, the starry sky withered. Before any of the ghosts could reach Meng Hao, they faded away into nothing.</p>
 <p>With the exception of Transcendors, all living beings would have a very difficult time staving off the ravages of the passage of Time. Of course, the Ghost had Transcended, but as for all of the ghosts that had been summoned, they had no such qualifications.</p>
 <p>As the ghosts were transformed into ash and smoke, the Ghost version of Allheaven looked on with flashing eyes. This outcome was something he had predicted would happen, and in fact, a closer look would reveal that he was actually smiling.</p>
 <p>Even as that smile appeared, he began to speak in a bizarre voice.</p>
 <p>“Millions upon millions of ghosts entomb the mind and transform it in my image! Go, invade the hearts of all! Shadowheart Tribulation!”</p>
 <p>Even as the words left his mouth, his body began to distort and shrink, transforming into a shadow that couldn’t be affected at all by Meng Hao’s magical manipulation of Time. He was like a blur as he shot toward Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The drifting ash and dust that was all that remained of the ghosts from moments ago suddenly seemed to become sustenance for this shadow. As it neared, its power level rose to a level so high that apparently, the Ghost didn’t even need to get close to Meng Hao to hurt him. The shadow seemed to merge with the void, casting everything around Meng Hao into darkness.</p>
 <p>Allheaven’s voice then began to echo out in all directions. “Meng Hao, I will now ruin your Demon Sealing Hexing magic, your so-called Third Hex!”</p>
 <p>The boundless shadows swirled around Meng Hao at high speed, emanating shocking coldness. As for Meng Hao, his eyes flickered icily as he performed an incantation gesture. However, the Present-Ancient Hexing did nothing.</p>
 <p>“Well done, Ghost....” he murmured. It was a critical juncture, and yet his expression was placid. Instead of continuing to try to force a result out of the Third Hex, he chuckled coldly and allowed the shadows to surge into his body.</p>
 <p>Soon, they had completely merged into him, fusing with him, becoming a part of him.</p>
 <p>This Ghost version of Allheaven might not be able to kill Meng Hao, but the truth was that he didn't intend to. He wanted to find a weakness within Meng Hao’s Hexing magic, and then use that weakness to infect and even ruin that magic!</p>
 <p>Only by doing such a thing could he have a chance to cut Meng Hao down in their final battle. The truth was, what terrified Allheaven the most was what had led Meng Hao all the way to Transcendence in the first place... his Demon Sealing Hexing magic!</p>
 <p>“You think you can ruin my Demon Sealing Hexing magic?!” Meng Hao let out a cold harrumph. Although spectators wouldn’t be able to tell, he knew that the power of Present and Ancient was completely beyond the ordinary.</p>
 <p>If it couldn’t be defended against outside the body, then how much more powerful would it be inside the body, especially when backed by the power of the Daosource? The true question was, would the ghosts inside of Meng Hao ruin the Hexing magic, or would the Hexing magic destroy the ghosts?</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as Meng Hao lifted his right hand up and touched his index finger to his forehead. In that instant, the Present-Ancient power of Time erupted out inside of him.</p>
 <p>The boundless power of Time flowed through Meng Hao, seemingly soft, but as powerful as an ocean which, with enough time, could wear away even the most majestic of reefs.</p>
 <p>An explosion of Time occurred inside of Meng Hao, and as that happened, the ghosts inside of him went mad. They began to weaken, until Meng Hao flicked his sleeve. It took only a single breath of time for 100,000,000 years passed by.</p>
 <p>Ten breaths of time later, all of the ghosts inside of him were completely destroyed by the passage of Time.</p>
 <p>He reached out his hand, and the Present-Ancient Hexing spun within his palm, filling up with countless figures, becoming a shining sphere. Finally, he clenched his hand into a fist, and a cracking sound could be heard as the sphere was smashed.</p>
 <p>Not too far away in the starry sky, Allheaven’s clone coughed up a mouthful of blood, and within the vicious expression on his face could be seen just a touch of shock.</p>
 <p>“Time to finish things,” Meng Hao said, his eyes flickering with killing intent. His murderous aura then transformed into a corporeal blade which slashed toward Allheaven!</p>
