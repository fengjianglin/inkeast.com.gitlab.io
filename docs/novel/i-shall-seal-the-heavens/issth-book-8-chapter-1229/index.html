 <p><strong>Chapter 1229: Did I Say You Could Go?</strong></p>
 <p>Meng Hao watched as the Nine Mountains and the Nine Seas formed into the shape of a huge giant, apparently shaped together by the call of the Daoist priest’s magic. As soon as it appeared there in the starry sky, it waved its finger toward the enemy cultivators.</p>
 <p>That simple wave of a finger caused the starry sky to be swept away, layer after layer. The cultivator’s faces were filled with shock and quickly fell back, even the Dao Realm experts.</p>
 <p>Many people were aware that the Noble Ran of the Righteous Noble Sect had created the Seal the Heavens Incantation. When it was brought up in conversation, it was generally considered a big joke, and therefore, no one would ever have been able to guess that when the Daoist priest unleashed it on this day... it would explode out with a shocking, supreme power.</p>
 <p>Blood sprayed out of the mouths of the ordinary cultivators, and the Dao Realm experts could not prevent the blood from oozing out of their mouths. The single wave of the giant’s finger was apparently backed by the power of the Mountains and Seas, and it wasn’t targeting the cultivators in order to harm them, it was actually... performing a sealing.</p>
 <p>One swipe of a finger was sealing the Heavens!</p>
 <p>If the Heavens could be sealed, there was no need to even mention the people under them!</p>
 <p>That waving finger caused sealing marks to appear on all the cultivators. One by one, they coughed up blood, and were sent spinning through the starry sky, completely out of control.</p>
 <p>“The Seal the Heavens Incantation.... This is impossible!!”</p>
 <p>“How could the Noble Ran’s poppycock magical technique actually be... so powerful!!” Everyone was astonished.</p>
 <p>The Daoist priest was trembling, and he also coughed up a mouthful of blood, and instantly aged significantly. In order to avoid any further trouble for the Righteous Noble Sect, he ceased any further attacks. Then he turned and looked at the resplendent beam of light which was fading off into the distance.</p>
 <p>It was almost as if he could see Meng Hao within the light, and could tell that he was just as shocked as all the other cultivators at what had happened.</p>
 <p>“My little disciple,” he said coolly, “this is your Master’s Seal the Heavens Incantation!” Then he remained there, hovering in midair, surrounded by the other cultivators who had all just been scattered about.</p>
 <p>A certain aura was emanating off of him in that moment, an aura that was difficult to describe. Suddenly, he no longer seemed muddle-headed and unreliable. He looked like a transcendent being, completely beyond ordinary.</p>
 <p>Completely ignoring the other cultivators, he turned and headed back to Planet Luo River and the Righteous Noble Sect!</p>
 <p>In another patch of the starry sky in the territory of the Heavengod Alliance, near the border, floated an asteroid . No records from any sect contained any information about a teleportation node on this particular asteroid, but all of a sudden, it began to glow brightly. Moments later, the asteroid exploded into pieces as a stone platform appeared from within.</p>
 <p>The platform itself was covered with cracks and the markings of a teleportation spell formation. The spell formation was currently activated and running at full power and, from the looks of it, it wouldn’t be too long until it broke down completely. Soon, more cracks appeared over its surface, and a flying shuttle flew out from inside of it.</p>
 <p>As soon as it did, the stone platform lost its ability to hold itself together, and shattered. At the same time, the flying shuttle also transformed into ash.</p>
 <p>Subsequently, Meng Hao appeared there in the starry sky.</p>
 <p>Everything was quiet; not a single sound could be heard. Meng Hao turned and looked off into the distance, still thinking with amazement about what he had just seen.</p>
 <p>“Seal... the Heavens... Incantation....” he murmured. How could he ever have imagined that the Daoist priest’s comical magical technique would be so shockingly powerful?</p>
 <p>For one person to seal hundreds of thousands of cultivators... well, that Daoist magic was definitely no ordinary Dao, it had ascended to the level of a strategic weapon. One could even imagine how, if there was some great war being fought, the Daoist priest could completely turn the tides by himself.</p>
 <p>In all the years he had practiced cultivation, Meng Hao had never seen anything like it before, and it left his heart racing. After all, throughout the more than one month that he had been in the Righteous Noble Sect, he had practiced the technique hundreds of times at the bequest of the Daoist priest.</p>
 <p>“There’s always something new to learn....” he murmured. “The further you travel, the more you see and experience. It's only then that you realize that there are Heavens beyond what you imagined could exist, and likewise, people who exceed your imagination. Likewise, whatever Daoist magics you knew, there are always more powerful ones out there!” Staring off into the distance, he clasped hands and bowed deeply in his appreciation toward the Daoist priest.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao was the type of person to remember every single individual who had helped him.</p>
 <p>However, he also knew that now was not the time to wallow in emotions. After bowing, he quickly shot off into the distance.</p>
 <p>“The border region of the Heavengod Alliance is dotted with artificial planets that are used as teleportation checkpoints. Other than those planets, there is nothing else but the vast border itself....</p>
 <p>“The gateway planets will be heavily fortified, and I definitely won’t be able to get past them.... Therefore, I’ll just have to break through that endless border.” Having made his decision, he took advantage of the fact that no one was around to shoot off into the distance.</p>
 <p>Time passed. A day later, something like a white line appeared off in the distance. At first he couldn’t quite tell what it was, but as he neared, the white line turned into a white wall. It was illusory, and spread out as far as the eye could see in either direction. Meng Hao looked it over, hesitating for a moment. Finally, a cold glint appeared in his eyes as he shot toward the wall.</p>
 <p>He reached it in the blink of an eye, and then slammed into it with the full force of his Paragon Bridge. The wall shuddered, and cracking sounds could be heard as fissures spread out across the surface of the wall.</p>
 <p>Just as he was on the verge of breaking through, his face fell and he suddenly stopped in place due to the intense sensation of deadly crisis that filled his mind. A beam of light suddenly appeared out in the void, spreading out as if to envelop Meng Hao and lock him in place.</p>
 <p>“Nobody who goes berserk in the Heavengod Alliance can leave peacefully.” The owner of the calm voice was an illusory face which had just appeared in the starry sky. It was none other than the old man who had originally determined Meng Hao’s location.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes gleamed icily, and he gave a cold harrumph as he once again battered the white wall, shattering it. He burst through, assuming he was now outside of the Heavengod Alliance, only to find that directly ahead of him was a second white line, which was... a second white wall!</p>
 <p>Just looking at it, it was possible to tell that there was not just a second white wall, but beyond it, a third one and a fourth one.... They went on and on, packed together one after another. Unexpectedly, there were no less than 100,000 walls!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s face instantly turned unsightly.</p>
 <p>“The Heavengod Alliance is not a place where people can just come and go as they please. The Noble Ran might have helped you, but you still... have no way of escaping.”</p>
 <p>Even as the old man spoke, the light of numerous teleportations began to shine up in the area. A total of fifteen teleportation formations could now be seen, with the shadows of countless individuals forming inside of them.</p>
 <p>Once they fully appeared, it seemed as if Meng Hao would have no other choice but to attempt to flee.</p>
 <p>However, the old man had underestimated Meng Hao. In almost the same instant the teleportation light began to shine, Meng Hao suddenly looked over at the illusory face.</p>
 <p>“So, it turns out you can’t come here personally, nor can you actually kill me. All you can do is control the power of the Heavengod Alliance’s border....” The old man’s expression flickered as Meng Hao’s cultivation base suddenly exploded with the power of an Allheaven Dao Immortal, and his peak fleshly body. Rumbling sounds could be heard as, unexpectedly, he didn't flee, but instead shot toward the teleportation portals.</p>
 <p>As soon as he closed in, he unleashed the God-Slaying Fist.</p>
 <p>The fist landed on a teleportation portal that was just about to complete its teleportation. When Meng Hao struck it, it distorted, and then the cultivators inside shouted out in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Break,” Meng Hao said coolly. Instantly, the teleportation collapsed, and the cultivators inside began to distort as the teleportation magic was destroyed. As for the cultivators inside, only the most powerful were free from danger, and yet, even they were now incapable of completing the teleportation.</p>
 <p>“Child!” the face roared angrily, and yet it was powerless to do anything. Meng Hao pretended as if he hadn’t heard anything at all. His body flickered as he unleashed another fist strike!</p>
 <p>One punch!</p>
 <p>One punch!</p>
 <p>Rumbling could be heard as three teleportation portals were destroyed in quick succession. As for the other eleven, the people inside were materializing. Meng Hao laughed coldly, then raised both hands high into the air. As he lowered them, he cried, “Paragon Bridge!”</p>
 <p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!</p>
 <p>The Paragon Bridge then exploded out from inside Meng Hao, bursting through the starry sky with crushing pressure. Instantly, four more teleportation portals were destroyed, and a moment later, five.</p>
 <p>There were only two teleportation portals which actually managed to finish their teleportation. Before they could be destroyed, the people inside of them charged out.</p>
 <p>There were a total of about a hundred cultivators, led by two people. One of them wore a long, blood-colored robe, and the other was the young man shadowed by the Heavengod image, who had his hands clasped behind his back. After looking around for a moment, their scalps went numb, and they actually wished that they hadn’t successfully teleported here to begin with.</p>
 <p>Of the fifteen teleportation portals they had begun with, only two had managed to teleport their passengers successfully. The two leaders’ hearts began to pound. Looking over at Meng Hao, they began to back up.</p>
 <p>They had come here to chase Meng Hao down and kill him, but now they were the ones who were running away!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao looked over at the enraged illusory face and said, “Since you won’t let me leave, then... I guess I’ll just stick around and have my fill of slaughtering your people for a while!”</p>
 <p>Laughing coldly, he shot toward the newly-arrived cultivators.</p>
 <p>The hundred or so cultivators’ scalps were all numb from the sight of Meng Hao charging them, his energy surging. The cultivators’ minds reeled, and they fell into retreat. If they had a bit more of an advantage in terms of numbers, and if they had some Dao Realm support, then they would be able to surround Meng Hao and bombard him from all sides. But now, they were facing Meng Hao by themselves, and it instantly drained their courage.</p>
 <p>After all, the person who had completely exterminated the Blacksoul Society was the type of person who left them completely terror-struck.</p>
 <p>“Think you can just leave?” Meng Hao asked, killing intent flickering in his eyes. He was already completely fed up with being chased, so he transformed into an azure-colored roc and shot toward the nearest cultivator. A talon that could shatter metal or rock slammed into the man’s head, and a cracking sound rang out. Blood spurted out in all directions, but by then Meng Hao had already appeared in front of another cultivator, whereupon he flapped his wings and transformed into a beam of azure light.</p>
 <p>Everywhere he went, blood-curdling screams rang out. The young man in the leadership position was terrified, and completely regretted coming to this place as his Heavengod image suddenly shattered. A popping sound could suddenly be heard from the other young leader, who instantly transformed into a red mist.</p>
 <p>“So, it turns out it was you!” Meng Hao eyed the red mist. Completely ignoring the young man with the Heavengod image, he shot forward in pursuit of the red mist.</p>
