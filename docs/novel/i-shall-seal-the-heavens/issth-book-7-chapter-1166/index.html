 <p><strong>Chapter 1166: Dad, Mom, Hao’er Has Come Back!</strong></p>
 <p>When Meng Hao left, it was as a Spirit Realm cultivator, taken away by Fang Xi’s father. Back then, he was a stranger without any reputation, someone the Fang Clan barely noticed. Neither did the Ninth Mountain and Sea pay him much heed.</p>
 <p>At that time, few people cared whether or not he lived or died.</p>
 <p>He left quietly, his parents looking on sadly. Upon leaving Planet South Heaven, he had told himself something....</p>
 <p>“One day I'll come back, and I’ll make dad and mom proud of me!”</p>
 <p>Today, he had come back!</p>
 <p>His cultivation base was no longer in the Spirit Realm. Instead, it was at the point where he could shake those of the terrifying Quasi-Dao level. Even powerful experts of the Senior generation would have to take him seriously, and treat him as an almighty member of their own generation.</p>
 <p>He was no longer a stranger without any reputation. Meng Hao was so famous that his name came up in conversation virtually every day in the Ninth Mountain and Sea. After all, he was also Crown Prince Fang Hao!</p>
 <p>Nobody could afford to disregard him, not the Ninth Mountain and Sea, not Paragon Sea Dream, not the Mountain and Sea Realm as a whole!</p>
 <p>He had come back, not alone, but rather, with a host of Fang Clan experts, all there to pay respects!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao hovered in the starry sky, looking in the direction of Planet South Heaven, thinking about many things. Finally, he called out in a loud voice: “Dad, mom, Hao’er has come back!”</p>
 <p>As his voice rang out, all of the cultivators in the sects and clans of Planet South Heaven trembled. They could all sense the massive pressure weighing down from the sky, and although they couldn't clearly see what was out there, they felt as if they were suffocating. It was as if countless beings were up above, emanating pressure, pushing Heaven and Earth to the point of collapse.</p>
 <p>In the Great Tang of the Eastern Lands, in a tiny city controlled by the Fang Clan, was a Tower of Tang. That was where Fang Xiufeng and Meng Li often went to look out into the starry sky and observe their children. That was where they had watched Meng Hao rise to prominence on Planet East Victory, something which had filled them with happiness, anticipation... and hope.</p>
 <p>“Did you hear that?” Meng Li asked, quivering slightly. She looked at her husband, who looked as somber as ever, and yet at the same time, was radiant with joy.</p>
 <p>“I heard,” Fang Xiufeng said, his tone extremely calm as he stood there. “You women are too excitable. You know how worldly-wise I am, so this is nothing new. Isn’t it just a big crowd? Why’d the kid have to make such a big deal over coming home? What a racket!” As he straightened out his clothes, Meng Li glared at him, clearly not very happy with his attitude.</p>
 <p>“Oh be quiet,” she said. “Don’t tell me you’re not pleased that your son got your whole clan to come pay respects. Stop pretending you don’t care, you think I don’t know you?” The two of them emerged from their house and flew up into the sky.</p>
 <p>“Women,” Fang Xiufeng muttered coolly, ignoring his wife’s words. They had just barely begun to fly up into the air when Fang Xiufeng suddenly blurted, “Wait, is this outfit alright?”</p>
 <p>He looked down and straightened out his garments one more time.</p>
 <p>“All we're doing is going to greet some Elders and Patriarchs, right?” Meng Li said, tongue in cheek. “Aren’t you the top Chosen of the last generation in the Fang Clan? Didn't you just say that you’re worldly-wise? Why are you suddenly so nervous?”</p>
 <p>“Who said anything about being nervous?” Fang Xiufeng retorted, coughing dryly. “I've been the top fighter for years, I don’t get nervous at anything. I was just thinking that I need to look good for Hao’er’s sake, now that he's back. The younger I look, the better.”</p>
 <p>Meng Li covered her mouth as she laughed. Her laughter made Fang Xiufeng even more embarrassed than before. It was actually just as his wife had said. Although he maintained a calm exterior, inside, he was bubbling with nervousness and excitement.</p>
 <p>The Fang Clan was his family, and although he had been willing to be stationed on Planet South Heaven for Meng Hao’s sake, he had never forgotten that he was part of them. Not once.</p>
 <p>Therefore, to see virtually the entire clan here to pay respects was incredibly moving.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s parents turned into two streaks of light that shot up into the starry sky outside of Planet South Heaven, which was the border between it and the rest of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. This was the furthest they could go from the lands of South Heaven. As soon as they arrived, Fang Xiufeng looked at Meng Hao, at the two Patriarchs standing behind him, and all the other countless clan members arrayed further back.</p>
 <p>Fang Xiufeng could keep his composure no longer. His face reddened as he clasped hands and made to bow. However, Meng Hao hurried forward and prevented him, then knelt down in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Hao’er pays respects to dad and mom!” he said. Even as his voice echoed out loudly, all of the Fang Clan cultivators, including the direct bloodline clan members, all clasped hands and bowed deeply.</p>
 <p>“We offer greetings, Clan Chief!!”</p>
 <p>As their voices echoed out in all directions, Fang Xiufeng stared in shock and disbelief. He looked at Meng Hao, and then all the familiar faces further off. Finally, his gaze came to rest on Fang Shoudao.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch... this....”</p>
 <p>“Xiufeng, you are rendering a great service by standing guard here on Planet South Heaven. Furthermore, you have made many other great contributions to the clan. I have already discussed the matter with the leadership in the clan, and from henceforth, you will be the Clan Chief of the Fang Clan!” Fang Shoudao gazed deeply at Fang Xiufeng, his expression somber as he also clasped hands and bowed.</p>
 <p>“Fang Shoudao offers greetings to the Clan Chief!”</p>
 <p>“Fang Yanxu offers greetings to the Clan Chief!” As soon as the two Patriarchs bowed, the direct bloodline clan members immediately lowered their heads and bowed.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Clan Chief!”</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Clan Chief!!”</p>
 <p>Their voices echoed out like thunder, causing the starry sky to tremble, sending ripples out into the void. The chorus of a million voices could even be heard down on the lands of Planet South Heaven.</p>
 <p>Fang Xiufeng was trembling, and Meng Li gaped in shock. Meng Hao finally rose to his feet and walked over to his father and mother. He gazed at his mother for a moment, then gave her a big hug.</p>
 <p>“Hao’er, this....” Meng Li was shocked at everything that was happening and looked at Meng Hao questioningly, unable to wrap her mind around what was happening. Previously, both she and her husband had assumed the clan coming to pay respects was a mere formality, an outward display of respect shown as a gift from the clan.</p>
 <p>However, despite guessing that there was another reason for the visit, neither of them could ever have imagined that... it was to make Fang Xiufeng the Clan Chief!</p>
 <p>“Mom,” Meng Hao said, smiling, “I'm the Crown Prince of the Fang Clan. It’s only natural that dad should be the Clan Chief. I wouldn’t accept anyone else but him.” Although his words seemed casual, in truth, they carried a domineering air that only a select few could detect.</p>
 <p>Fang Xiufeng’s eyes shone brightly, and he looked at Meng Hao with a somber expression. His lips moved slightly as he quickly transmitted some questions to Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao hid nothing. He briefly responded with a description of Allheaven Clans and Dao seeds, after which, Fang Xiufeng trembled.</p>
 <p>“So, it's called a Dao seed....” Fang Xiufeng murmured. He had realized earlier that his energy was noticeably different than before, something he had previously found hard to believe. It had seemed completely outlandish. But now that he knew both the cause and the effect, Fang Xiufeng suddenly realized that it was just as Meng Hao had said; other than himself... Meng Hao would never have approved of anyone else being the Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>That was one area that Fang Shoudao and Fang Yanxu had been worried about.</p>
 <p>“Many thanks, Patriarchs Shoudao and Yanxu. Since the clan wishes that I be the Clan Chief, well then... I will do everything in my power to live up to the duty and obligation.” Fang Xiufeng did not refuse. Suddenly, his energy grew more awe-inspiring. His eyes shone like lightning, and as he looked around at all the members of the Fang Clan, his cultivation base erupted with power.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, it turned into a tempest which shook the entire starry sky, causing all hearts to tremble. At the same time, Soul Lamps appeared around him, instantly revealing his cultivation base to be at the great circle of the Ancient Realm!</p>
 <p>He seemed not a bit less powerful than Guru Heavencloud; he was just a single step away from the Dao Realm. Furthermore, that step could be taken at any time he wished.</p>
 <p>However, if he failed, he would end up in the Quasi-Dao Realm. The main reason he wished to avoid such an outcome was not because he feared death. No, he wanted to live as long as possible, so that he could strike fear into the hearts of any enemies of his son and daughter.</p>
 <p>As his energy surged out in all directions, the clan members who had previously been hesitant to accept this new development could suddenly sense how powerful Fang Xiufeng was.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Fang Xiufeng was a sword cultivator. Sword cultivators were inherently powerful, so that, coupled with his cultivation base, made it so that at his full power Fang Xiufeng was clearly strong enough to fight with Quasi-Dao experts!</p>
 <p>Even more shocking was that natural laws and Essence also swirled around him. Although it might have seemed like he didn’t practice cultivation while on Planet South Heaven, the truth of the matter was that his cultivation had long since ceased to be practiced externally, and was all performed internally. The focus was no longer his fleshly body, but his heart.</p>
 <p>Up to this day, he had never revealed the full extent of his shocking power to anyone.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes glittered, and he suddenly waved his finger casually. No one other than Fang Shoudao could detect the meaning of that seemingly random act.</p>
 <p>As soon as Meng Hao’s finger waved through the air, the Dao seed in Fang Xiufeng suddenly exploded with power. The azure glow which already existed inside of him grew more dazzling, until it was like a beam of azure light shining up into the starry sky.</p>
 <p>As soon as that beam of azure light appeared, Fang Xiufeng’s energy grew even more powerful. Strange colors flashed, and all of Planet South Heaven rumbled. Shockingly... the power of an Allheaven Immortal was... awakening in Fang Xiufeng!</p>
 <p>Because of that, the azure light in him grew even stronger. His cultivation base rotated and his blood surged. At the same time, an Imperial will suddenly flickered in his eyes.</p>
 <p>When the members of the Fang Clan saw this, they were completely shocked. As for Fang Shoudao, his eyes gleamed with a strange light, and with excitement.</p>
 <p>Apparently because of the power of the bloodline, the initial awakening of the Allheaven Immortal within Fang Xiufeng caused azure light to also shine up brilliantly from all the other members of the Fang Clan.</p>
 <p>The starry sky shook, and the lands quaked. It was as if the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea was being shaken. Even the Mountain and Sea Realm trembled. Apparently... they were all bearing witness to the rise of an Allheaven Clan!</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Clan Chief!”</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Clan Chief!!” It was hard to say who began crying it out first, but soon the noise of the voices was even louder than before, echoing out like a storm.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao, on the other hand, looked exhausted. Although the wave of his finger had seemed simple, it left him feeling drained. However, to see his father looking so powerful, and his mother so excited, made it all worth it.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao smiled, a charming, happy smile.</p>
