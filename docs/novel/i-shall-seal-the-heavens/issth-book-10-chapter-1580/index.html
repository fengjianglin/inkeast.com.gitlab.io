 <p><strong>Chapter 1580: Third Transformation!</strong></p>
 <p>Emperor Dragons primarily ate serpents. They only existed for a short time within the starry sky of the Vast Expanse, less than a thousand years. After that, the entire race vanished.</p>
 <p>Because of that, none of the living beings that currently existed would even recognize what an Emperor Dragon was. Not even the old lizard had ever seen one.</p>
 <p>People had seen dragons before, but not a dragon like this, with the crown of an Emperor, nine claws, and pitch-black scales. It was ferocious to the extreme.</p>
 <p>However, the meaning of the character in the Dragon’s name actually wasn’t emperor. It was leech! [1. In Chinese the two characters used here for emperor and leech here have exactly the same pronunciation, even down to the tone, making this wordplay pretty cool in Chinese.]</p>
 <p>A Leech Dragon!</p>
 <p>It had the normal whiskers of a dragon, but when it opened its mouth, what emerged was a razor-sharp, blood-sucking mouthpiece like that of a mosquito. Its entire appearance was shocking to the extreme.</p>
 <p>Virtually no one was even aware that such creatures had ever existed. They were extinct. In fact, the only person in the starry sky who knew about them... was Allheaven. By creating something out of nothing, he was able to use the Leech Dragon as his second transformation!</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as the Emperor Dragon appeared, its energy redoubled several times, reaching a completely shocking level that caused even Meng Hao to frown.</p>
 <p>He knew that Allheaven was powerful, and that defeating him in battle would be no easy task. Now that he could see these Allheaven Transformations for himself, especially the Emperor Dragon, he was left with an uneasy feeling of impending doom.</p>
 <p>“This Emperor Dragon is not just Transcendent in terms of fleshly body, but also cultivation base,” thought Meng Hao. “As for its soul... that appears to be its only limitation. However, from the look of it, all it would need would be some time to make that breakthrough! In fact, I’ve never encountered something that could actually break through to full Transcendence so easily!</p>
 <p>“Allheaven created something from nothing, and managed to make up for some of the deficiencies of the soul. This thing... is actually the same type of living being as the nine-headed serpent, but in terms of overall level, that serpent couldn’t even compare.” Meng Hao’s eyes glittered as the Second Demon Sealing Hex was unleashed, Real-Unreal Hexing. Instantly, the surrounding void filled with numerous bizarre fluctuations that rapidly coalesced into the form of a mirror. Unexpectedly, visible within that mirror was another Emperor Dragon, which looked exactly like the first!</p>
 <p>Even as the newly created Emperor Dragon roared, Meng Hao waved his hand, sending it flying toward Allheaven’s Emperor Dragon.</p>
 <p>The sudden appearance of these two dragons was a shock to everyone present. Even as their cold gazes locked onto each other, an intense murderous aura exploded out from each dragon, which collided into the other. Both of them began to wither rapidly.</p>
 <p>This was the trump card of Emperor Dragons, the Emperor Dragon Cosmic Corrosion!</p>
 <p>Piercing howls echoed out as the two Emperor Dragons withered up. However, after only a moment passed, blood suddenly spurted out all over Allheaven’s Emperor Dragon. In the blink of an eye, it was stained completely blood-red. Exuding an air of domineering madness, it then flew through the void toward Meng Hao like a shooting star.</p>
 <p>It closed in with spectacular speed, shattering the starry sky, seemingly bent on crushing anything that dared to get in its path.</p>
 <p>This was the ultimate divine ability of Emperor Dragons, Blood Tyranny.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the Emperor Dragon’s energy and power rose to heights that could ignore all natural laws. As it closed in, Meng Hao snorted coldly, then waved his sleeve, causing his own Emperor Dragon to utilize the exact same divine ability.</p>
 <p>The two Emperor Dragons slammed into each other, and a huge boom echoed out. Meng Hao frowned as his own Emperor Dragon was shredded to pieces, completely incapable of harming Allheaven’s dragon, which continued on with its deadly charge.</p>
 <p>It seemed as if all living beings, all types of power, all Transcendent cultivators, would be crushed by this attack. It was a simple attack, but an attack filled with infinitely destructive power.</p>
 <p>The simpler and madder the attack, the more powerful it was!</p>
 <p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE! The Emperor Dragon got closer and closer. 3,000 meters. 300 meters. 30 meters. The blood covering its body burned, and it looked like nothing in the starry sky could do anything to stop it. It was as if this attack was strong enough to break out into the Universe itself. It seemed invincible, unblockable, capable of turning anything it struck into ash.</p>
 <p>The sense of deadly crisis within Meng Hao grew more intense.</p>
 <p>“A Transcendent Emperor Dragon, making its ultimate attack...” His eyes flickered with the desire to do battle. This was the first true fight he had experienced since Transcending. The first Allheaven Transformation didn't leave him with much of a desire to fight, but now, that feeling was burning hot within him.</p>
 <p>“What a pity,” he said, shaking his head. Instead of fighting back, he simply reached up and pushed out with his hand.</p>
 <p>“Unreal!”</p>
 <p>With that single word, he completed the unleashing the Second Demon Sealing Hex, the Real-Unreal Hexing. By using the “real” aspect of the Hex, he created a projection of the dragon. But by using the “unreal” aspect, he could transform what was real into something illusory.</p>
 <p><em>If I say you really exist, then even if you die, you shall still exist!</em></p>
 <p><em>If I say you are not real, then you shall vanish into unreality!</em></p>
 <p>The ripples in the area suddenly faded away into shapelessness. A shocking energy blasted into the Emperor Dragon, which then lurched a halt a mere three meters in front of Meng Hao’s hand, where it trembled, a look of disbelief shining in its eyes.</p>
 <p>“Disperse,” he said, waving his hand gently to the left. Instantly, the Emperor Dragon’s energy, all of its domineering power, all of its invincibility, was crushed away. The dragon’s body shattered, and it dispersed.</p>
 <p>The Real-Unreal Hexing could make things both real and unreal!</p>
 <p>“That’s the best you’ve got, Allheaven? If so, I’m afraid you’re not going to get a chance to see all of my Demon Sealing Hexing magic.” Meng Hao’s eyes glittered as coldly as a sharp blade as he looked off into the void, where Allheaven was materializing back into another clone.</p>
 <p>His young face was ashen; although Meng Hao’s strength was not anything unexpected to him, he was still left with a feeling of lingering fear. However, he couldn’t bring himself to admit that it was true strength on the part of Meng Hao; in his mind, it was merely weakness on his part after having existed for so long within the stream of time.</p>
 <p>“I won't stop fighting until one of us is dead!” growled Allheaven’s clone. Even as the words left his mouth... ghost fire sprang up all over him!</p>
 <p>It was the third Allheaven Transformation!</p>
