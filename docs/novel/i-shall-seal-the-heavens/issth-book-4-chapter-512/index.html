 <p>Voices joined together to instantly shake the surrounding Cultivators of the alliance of twenty bandit Tribes. They stared in shock, along with the members of the Black Dragon Tribe. Everyone was flabbergasted.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>At the same time, the seething fog began to grow thicker and emanate a shocking aura. The surrounded members of the bandit Tribes had no choice but to fall back. Some who didn’t move fast enough were sucked into the fog. Instantly, bloodcurdling screams could be heard as they were trampled to death.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just the Cultivators of the twenty bandit Tribes that gasped. The members of the Black Dragon Tribe were the same, and even the Cultivators of the Heavenly Court Alliance and other great Tribes who were on Blackgate Fort. Everyone was completely shaken.</p>
 <p>“What are they yelling?”</p>
 <p>“Who is Lord Fifth?”</p>
 <p>“How come I feel like I’ve heard this before…?”</p>
 <p>As of this moment, Meng Hao was now the only member of the Crow Divinity Tribe who was on the outside. His body was a wisp of green smoke that flickered back and forth, taking advantage of this opportunity to slay more of the early Nascent Soul Elders.</p>
 <p>Even as miserable cries rang out, countless bloodshot gazes suddenly came to rest on Meng Hao as all of the Nascent Soul Cultivators suddenly turned to look at Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>Given that they could no longer attack the Crow Divinity Tribe, Meng Hao was suddenly a glowing target. Instantly all of the bandit Tribes’ Nascent Soul Cultivators shot toward Meng Hao, along with more than ten totemic Sacred Ancients. They radiated killing intent as they neared him.</p>
 <p>These powerful experts were a force that could cause anyone under the Spirit Severing stage to be dumbstruck. Even Meng Hao would not be able to stand up to their combined attack. In fact… if they managed to attack him from all sides, then he would certainly be torn to pieces and completely exterminated.</p>
 <p>The forces aligned against him were far more than he could handle. However… that was exactly what Meng Hao wanted.</p>
 <p>Roughly seventy percent of the bandit Tribes’ most powerful experts and totemic Sacred Ancients were now closing in on Meng Hao, filled with killing intent, their eyes shining with the desire to slay him. It was at this point that Meng Hao suddenly stopped moving. For the first time, he hovered there in mid-air, not moving even an inch.</p>
 <p>The fact that he had stopped instantly attracted countless looks from the majority of the members of the twenty allied Bandit tribes. Virtually all of their most powerful experts looked at Meng Hao with vicious killing intent, and then shot toward him. Instantly, he was being charged from all directions.</p>
 <p>“DIE!!” came the grim cries as the people came closer and closer. In the blink of an eye, they had surrounded Meng Hao. It was at this point that Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding with his right hand. Instantly, a wooden box appeared which he held high up into the air. His expression was dark as he slowly opened its lid.</p>
 <p>Within the wooden box was a blooming flower.</p>
 <p>Exotic Heartdevil Flower!! [1. The Exotic Heartdevil Flower was used by the Five Poisons Tribe against the Five Crow Divinity Tribes in chapters <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-4-chapter-439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">439</a>, <a href="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-4-chapter-440/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">440</a> and beyond]</p>
 <p>In this instant, all eyes subconsciously looked over at the flower. When that happened, an intense rumbling filled the minds of all onlookers. Instantly, the whole battlefield turned deathly silent.</p>
 <p>Within that deathly silence, the Exotic Heartdevil flower began to wilt. This flower was extremely powerful, but there were simply too many Cultivators present. The vast number of people in the area was causing the flower to begin to wither.</p>
 <p>Of course, Meng Hao had long since predicted that this would happen. After acquiring the flower, he had studied it and come to understand it. All he wanted was this one brief moment.</p>
 <p>During that moment, the only people who weren’t affected were the members of the Heavenly Court Alliance and the members of the great Tribes up on the battlement of Blackgate Fort. It was as if they were in a different world.</p>
 <p>However, their expressions were filled with shock. Absolute silence reigned. They looked down at the Exotic Heartdevil Flower, and the deathly still that covered the battlefield.</p>
 <p>“Exotic Heartdevil Flower….”</p>
 <p>“Who could ever have imagined that the Crow Divinity Tribe would still have that flower!?”</p>
 <p>“It’s a rare flower, but actually somewhat weak. However, if you use it cleverly it can be considered a precious treasure!”</p>
 <p>Duo Lan was breathing heavily as she looked down at the scene. The sense of deja vu she was experiencing continued to grow stronger. However, she still could not figure out who exactly Meng Hao was.</p>
 <p>Next to her, Zhang Wenzu seemed to be paying attention to the scene below, although only slightly.</p>
 <p>As for Luo Chong, he was panting as he looked down at Meng Hao. Within his complicated feelings was a touch of admiration.</p>
 <p>Zhou Dekun was blinking. He had never imagined that Meng Hao would have a treasure such as this.</p>
 <p>Even as everyone up on the battlement of Blackgate Fort was shocked, down on the battlefield, the Nascent Soul Cultivators who had been chasing Meng Hao, as well as the totemic Sacred Ancients, were all trembling, motionless. It was at this point that Meng Hao made his move.</p>
 <p>A Blood Clone appeared. Its expression was one of greed, as if it thirsted to drink up lives. As it shot toward the group of more than ten totemic Sacred Ancients, Meng Hao stepped forward and hurled the Devil Spear out. A towering devilish mist rose up, filled with countless faces, to shoot toward the crowds of people.</p>
 <p>Next, Meng Hao took a deep breath as his Wood-type totem tattoo magically appeared on his forehead. A sea of flames roared into being and freezing Frost soil spread out. The all-conquering power of the his Metal-type totem tattoo was fused in as well. Four of the five elements instantly exploded out.</p>
 <p>The sea of flames burned everything. The gigantic tree extinguished lives. The power of metal slashed through the air. The Frost soil kicked up a frigid wind that froze the sky.</p>
 <p>Booming filled the air as all of these things happened in the exact same moment. There were no bloodcurdling cries. However, one totemic Sacred Ancient after another withered up. One Nascent Soul Cultivator after another felt their bodies exploding.</p>
 <p>All of it happened in the space of only eight breaths. During those eight breaths, Meng Hao was able to completely reverse the situation on the battlefield.</p>
 <p>For four breaths of time, the power of Meng Hao’s four elements totems swept out explosively in all directions. The power transformed into an attack which slammed into the Nascent Soul Cultivators.</p>
 <p>One bandit Tribe Elder after another felt their Cultivation base burn under the power of the Exotic Heartdevil Flower. Their bodies were not under their own control, and their wills were lost. Any power they had to resist Meng Hao’s divine abilities and magical techniques was completely weakened to the point where they could not withstand even a single blow.</p>
 <p>Massive booms echoed out across the battlefield as the ordinary Cultivators of the bandit Tribes trembled, their faces filled with confusion. They felt as if they were experiencing an out of body experience, as if their bodies were mere husks.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao knew that the entire battlefield would belong to him for the space of time of eight breaths.</p>
 <p>At the same time, discussions broke out on the battlement of Blackgate Fort.</p>
 <p>“This guy is completely cruel and diabolical!!”</p>
 <p>“He intentionally caught the attention of all the powerful experts, then took advantage of the situation to take out the Exotic Heartdevil Flower. He’s not just vicious, he’s adept at scheming. However, if he thinks he can turn the tide of the entire battle with only that flower, then he’s a bit naive!”</p>
 <p>“That flower has it limits. At the most it will probably last for the space of ten breaths before vanishing. Maybe he can kill some people during that time, but, exactly how many? For example, those late Nascent Soul stage experts are fundamentally powerful enough to last for even sixteen breaths under the influence of an Exotic Heartdevil Flower.”</p>
 <p>By this time, five breaths of time had passed. The Exotic Heartdevil Flower was half withered, and its power was beginning to wane. The late Nascent Soul stage Cultivators were showing signs of intense struggle; it seemed it wouldn’t be long before they were able to shake off the effects of the flower. Meng Hao’s eyes flickered. He did not continue with any slaughtering, but instead began to perform an incantation. He pointed his finger down toward the ground, causing boundless Demonic Qi to instantly rise up. A vortex appeared that only he could see as it then began to rotate soundlessly. Meng Hao became the center of a raging tower of Demonic Qi.</p>
 <p>Under the crushing pressure of this Demonic Qi, the 400,000 enemy neo-demons, who were no longer under the control of their Dragoneers, and were also being affected by the Exotic Heartdevil Flower, also began to tremble.</p>
 <p>In their eyes, Meng Hao was like some sort of Demon Emperor. Because of the Demonic Qi, they had no choice but to yield to the pressure. As the last of the eight breaths ran out, one neo-demon after another lowered their heads and began to approach Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>The Exotic Heartdevil Flower was fully wilted; it transformed into ash which then drifted away with the wind.</p>
 <p>Everyone on the battlefield seemed to wake up as if from sleep. Their bodies trembled as they looked out in confusion. It took only a moment for the members of the bandit Tribes to suddenly gasp. Their expression instantly filled with complete disbelief.</p>
 <p>The moment that they woke up, the Blood Clone finished consuming a fifth totemic Sacred Ancient. At the same time, thirteen of the Nascent Soul Elders who had been surrounding Meng Hao, exploded into showers of blood under the power of Meng Hao’s four elements totems.</p>
 <p>If that were the extent of it, it wouldn’t count for much. However, before the Cultivators of the bandit Tribes alliance could even recover from their shock, they saw Meng Hao floating there in mid-air, surrounded by 400,000 neo-demons.</p>
 <p>At the same time, shocking roars could be heard as the bandit Tribes’ own 400,000 neo-demons shot toward Meng Hao. This was not an attack, but rather, they joined to circulate around him, emitting subservient cries.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, 800,000 neo-demons were completely shaking Heaven and Earth!!</p>
 <p>From ancient times until now, there had never been a person who could control an 800,000 strong neo-demon horde. To everyone watching, this was virtually inconceivable.</p>
 <p>Nonetheless, the sky outside of Blackgate Fort was now filled with 800,000 roaring neo-demons. The sky shook, and everyone on the battlement of was thoroughly astonished. Within Blackgate Fort itself, the Heavenly Court Alliance was startled. As for the powerful experts of the great Tribes with Spirit Severing Patriarchs, their minds were all filled with profound trembling.</p>
 <p>In fact… four streams of indescribably powerful Divine Sense suddenly spread out from within the Black Lands. These were… streams of Divine Sense belonging to Spirit Severing Patriarchs!</p>
 <p>These streams of Divine Sense were filled with intrepid, savage power. They passed through Blackgate Fort to sweep across the lands of the Western Desert, eventually coming to rest on Meng Hao and his horde of 800,000 neo-demons.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, the tide of the battle truly had turned!</p>
 <p>Everyone who stood atop Blackgate Fort was panting and staring in shock. It was in this moment that a tremor ran through Duo Lan. She suddenly realized why Meng Hao seemed so familiar.</p>
 <p>“He’s….” Her face filled with an expression of complete disbelief.</p>
 <p>Next to her, Zhang Wenzu’s face was now filled with concentration. As he looked at the 800,000 neo-demons, his scalp went numb.</p>
 <p>As of now, the Crow Divinity Tribe didn’t even need to attack. Nor did the Black Dragon Tribe need to fight. Meng Hao waved his hand, causing the 800,000 neo-demons to charge toward the allied bandit Tribes. The land trembled and the sky shook. The clouds in the sky roiled as the sounds of slaughter began to spread out.</p>
 <p>Miserable shrieks rang through the air one after another as the bandit Cultivators, as well as their totemic Sacred Ancients, Greatfathers, and other powerful experts, were instantly stupefied.</p>
 <p>They wanted to kill Meng Hao, but he was now hidden behind 800,000 neo-demons. How could they possibly kill him!?</p>
 <p>They wanted to slaughter the members of the Crow Divinity and great Black Dragon Tribe, to cause Meng Hao to show his face. However, the fog of the Crow Divinity Tribe’s spell formation towered up, within which could be seen the shadows of running figures. The members of the great Black Dragon Tribe were quickly absorbed into the fog of the spell formation, concealing them completely.</p>
