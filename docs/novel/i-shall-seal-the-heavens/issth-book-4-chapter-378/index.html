 <p><strong>Chapter 378: Exterminate the Spirit!</strong></p>
 <p>“I am the Agarwood, a Spirit from the Ninth Sea. I fell to South Heaven and into the Western Desert…. I encountered a magical transformation, which reopened my consciousness. Righteous Bestowal made me Demonic. My bloodline remained in South Heaven and evolved into a Clan. My legacy was passed down from generation to generation, but few nowadays possess my bloodline.</p>
 <p>“The Agarwood has two heads, the body of a dragon, and the tail of a phoenix. It never sheds tears; shedding tears ends its life. Now, I am gone. I left South Heaven to return home…. Other than the League of Demon Sealers, only my descendants can receive my legacy!” The ancient voice echoed out in Meng Hao’s head. Endless amounts of glorious light surrounded him. Suddenly, the illusory image of a creature appeared. It was shaped like a dragon, with two heads, and the tail of a phoenix, and was no less than three thousand meters long!</p>
 <p>The instant the two-headed Agarwood appeared, the sky faded, and a roar filled all creation. Meng Hao could sense a bizarre, unspeakable power pouring into him from the Agarwood.</p>
 <p>The descending Lightning Blade of the black-robed Cultivator shattered into pieces. His eyes filled with astonishment, and he immediately fell back, dumbstruck. He could sense an unprecedented aura of fear and terror emanating off of this two-headed beast.</p>
 <p>“Run away!” This was the first thing that filled his mind. He had to get away from this place. His Cultivation base was at the Spirit Severing stage, but he was a cautious person. That was why he had done his research before coming here.</p>
 <p>His prudence was why he didn’t care that he was a Spirit Severing Patriarch, nor that he was facing up against nothing more than a Core Formation stripling. Matters regarding face meant nothing to him at the moment. All he cared about was the acute sense of crisis that filled his heart.</p>
 <p>As the black-robed Cultivator fled, a voice filled Meng Hao’s mind. The voice was familiar. It was none other than the sixth generation Patriarch, Hanxue Bao! “Kill him!”</p>
 <p>Next, another voice could be heard, that of the fifth generation Grand Dragoneer! “Kill him!”</p>
 <p>“Kill him!”</p>
 <p>“Kill him!”</p>
 <p>Voices filled his head. From the sixth generation all the way to the second, Qi’nan Tian. They rang out one after another, and as they did, Meng Hao’s eyes filled with a cold glow. He slowly lifted up his right hand.</p>
 <p>The Agarwood which twisted about in the air around him suddenly blurred with speed. It transformed into beams of light that bored into Meng Hao’s body, fusing into him!</p>
 <p>Meng Hao breathed in slowly, and then said, “Tempest!” Instantly, a black tempest sprang into being around Meng Hao. It spread out rapidly, making it seem as if the entire world were filled with its fury.</p>
 <p>Within the tempest appeared the towering figure of Hanxue Bao. His appearance was somewhat indistinct, but his stature was indomitable. As soon as he appeared, his gaze fell upon the black-robed Cultivator.</p>
 <p>The black-robed Cultivator’s scalp went numb, and a sensation like death swept over him. He suddenly had the urge to laugh out loud. He was a Spirit Severing Patriarch, and yet here he was, feeling the approach of death in front of a Core Formation Cultivator.</p>
 <p>Not only was it terrifying, it was supremely comical.</p>
 <p>“Ten Thousand Dragons,” said Meng Hao, waving his right hand. The Ten Thousand Dragons Pool appeared again. Within it, ten thousand black dragons roared. Shockingly, behind them appeared the figure of an old man wearing a black robe, who gazed coldly at the Spirit Severing Cultivator.</p>
 <p>This was none other than the fifth generation Patriarch!</p>
 <p>“Yellow Springs!” said Meng Hao, the third in his string of statements. A roaring sound filled the air as the Yellow Springs suddenly appeared, along with the eighteen layers of hell. The world turned gray, and a thick death aura sprang up which transformed into the image of a man wearing a gray robe. He held a skull in one hand, and gray Qi rippled around him which transformed into the images of all manner of beasts.</p>
 <p>This was the fourth generation Patriarch!</p>
 <p>“Midwinter!” said Meng Hao. He felt power bursting around him, all coming from the brands in his mind. This was the bizarre power of the Agarwood that had poured into him!</p>
 <p>The third patriarch appeared within a snowstorm, the coldness of which froze the very ground.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, crackling sounds filled the air as Mount Agarwood appeared, surrounding by endless snowy winds and lightning. At the very peak of the mountain, surrounding by snow and wind, was an old man who looked down at the black-robed Cultivator.</p>
 <p>The black-robed Cultivator’s face was pale white. He spit up a mouthful of blood, dramatically increasing his speed. He was trying to create a portal to teleport away, but couldn’t.</p>
 <p>“Four Seasons!” Killing intent radiated out from Meng Hao’s eyes. As it did, the sky above changed as images of the four seasons appeared, covering everything.</p>
 <p>“Agarwood!” This was the last of Meng Hao’s successive words. As he spoke them, his right hand descended, and he pointed directly at the fleeing black-robed Cultivator.</p>
 <p>As he extended his finger, the black tempest congealed into the form of two enormous wings!</p>
 <p>The ten thousand roaring dragons, along with the Dragons Pool itself, began the head of a dragon!</p>
 <p>The Yellow Springs twisted, pulling the eighteen layers of hell along with it to form an enormous dragon-shaped body, nearly three thousand meters long.</p>
 <p>Mount Agarwood collapsed, and the pieces formed into the tail and claws of a phoenix!</p>
 <p>Finally… the Four Seasons Sky fused together to form a second head. All of these things congealed together to become what in ancient times had rebuked the Heavens… the Agarwood!</p>
 <p>Stormy wings, dragons’ heads, a body formed from the Yellow Springs, a mountain for a tail, and the Four Seasons!</p>
 <p>When the Agarwood appeared, it let out a roar that cracked the sky and shattered the land. It was a force that could annihilate everything, sweeping out in all directions. At this moment, the black-robed Cultivator sensed an unprecedented feeling of life-and-death danger. It was a force of destruction which he could simply not bear.</p>
 <p>His pupils constricted, and both hands rapidly flashed an incantation. Magical treasures appeared, and finally a black glow that rose up to the heavens and took on the shape of a black sun.</p>
 <p>“If the true self of any of you appeared, I would be dead. Instead, you’ve formed the Agarwood. Well, I’ve performed my Second Severing. You can’t destroy my reincarnation. The only thing you can do is stop my first body!</p>
 <p>“Reincarnation exists, so I will always exist. My Karma cannot be annihilated! The Deification Altar of the Heavens of Ji has my name on it! You can’t hook my Karma! I’ll be resurrected!” The black-robed Cultivator raised his head up and howled. The black sun slammed into the Agarwood, and an enormous boom rose up. Everything shattered, destroying the land, killing all of the Cultivators directly below.</p>
 <p>Luo Chong was lucky; around the time Meng Hao had received the brand of the fifth generation Frigid Snow Patriarch, he’d gotten a bad feeling and had fled. Because of his prudent action, he and a few hundred other Cultivators who went with him were spared.</p>
 <p>The explosion rippled out, and the Agarwood slowly vanished.</p>
 <p>The black sun also faded. As it did, an image could be seen within of the black-robed Cultivator, which then transformed into ash. The brightly glowing light which had surrounded them slowly sank into the earth, and they were gone.</p>
 <p>The black-robed Cultivator was nowhere to be seen.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao wasn’t sure if he was alive or dead. Slowly, everything around him started to return to normal. An unparalleled sense of weakness washed through him. His vision started to fade and he began to collapse into unconsciousness.</p>
 <p>Before that could happen, though, he bit the tip of his tongue, using the last scrap of borrowed energy he possessed to do something he would normally be incapable of doing… he spit out some Divine Will which then shot off in the direction of the former Dongluo City.</p>
 <p>That was his final action before everything faded into blackness and he fell down to the ground.</p>
 <p>Holy Snow City was still there, although it was virtually in complete ruins. There were less than three hundred Cultivators left alive, including the Four Grand Elders. All of them stood there, their faces pale, looking at Meng Hao with expressions of deep veneration.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao couldn’t see anything, but he could sense that someone was holding him. He also smelled a delicate fragrance. Within the blackness of his world, an ancient voice slowly echoed out in his mind.</p>
 <p>“Successor, remember the Agarwood. I can project to you three times to help you avoid death.”</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, far away from Holy Snow City, on the other side of the Black Lands, in the former Dongluo City, more than five thousand Cultivators were running and yelling.</p>
 <p>“Have faith in the Lord Fifth, gain eternal life! When the Lord Fifth appears, who dares to cause strife!”</p>
 <p>The more than five thousand Cultivators were dashing around the city in a circular pattern. The sight of it was quite astonishing. The ground shook as they ran, and a fog roiled around them, deep within which was what appeared to be a bright glow.</p>
 <p>The glow bore the semblance of a sword, slowly gathering together. The glow didn’t spread out, although it did emanate a frightening aura. Nearby the glow was the parrot, who looked nervous. Its wings flapped as it flew around the bright glow.</p>
 <p>“Ah, the Immortal Execution Formation, created by none other than myself, Lord Fifth. Dammit, this spell formation never screwed Lord Fifth over nine times. That never happened!” The parrot clenched its jaw as if it had just made a difficult decision. Just as it seemed to be on the verge of charging into the bright light, the Divine Will from Meng Hao arrived.</p>
 <p>The parrot suddenly stopped moving. It stared in shock for a moment, then let out a shriek.</p>
 <p>“Scared me to death! Just about completely broke my concentration. So, you’re in trouble, eh Meng Hao? Need me to rescue you? Alright, alright. We’ll have to see what furred and feathered things you can find for me in the future. I guess I’ll go save you.” With that, the parrot flapped its wings, flying up.</p>
 <p>A roaring filled the air and the ground shook. More than five thousand Cultivators who had taken refuge in the Church of the Golden Light stared blankly up into the sky at the parrot as it spoke.</p>
 <p>“Listen up, children! Your Patriarch Golden Light is in trouble. Let’s go save him! Come come. Start running in the way I taught you. Use the steps of the Immortal Execution Formation. Three circles to the left, three circles to the right. Shake those butts…. Go as fast as you can! Now, call it out with me….”</p>
 <p>The Cultivators formed a long line and began running. A billowing fog sprang up that looked like dark clouds, which then whistled off into the distance.</p>
