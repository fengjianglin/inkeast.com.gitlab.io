 <p><strong>Chapter 55: Overbearing</strong></p>
 <p>A dark look flashed through Meng Hao’s eyes. He was surrounded by disciples of various Sects from the State of Zhao, and the white-robed Cultivators were approaching from the East gate. If he aroused the attention of the various eccentrics from the three sects within the city, then his chances of getting away would be very slim.</p>
 <p>When the disciples of the State of Zhao Sects saw the Violet Fate Sect disciples walking up, excited expressions lit their faces. To be able to make friends with them would increase their standing in their own respective Sects, and would provide great advantages in further development. Most of them had assumed the Violet Fate Sect disciples would ignore all of them, but it turned out they really were approaching them.</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Sun is very well known; that must be why they’re coming over.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah. He’s a blood relative of one of the Elders of the Winding Stream Sect. His Cultivation base is extraordinary. The Violet Fate Sect disciples must be coming over to give him some face.” One by one, ingratiating smiles appeared on the faces of the surrounding State of Zhao disciples, especially the young man in the expensive clothes. He was growing more and more excited. Hearing the whispers of the bystanders, his heart filled with pride. It seemed he was fairly well-known after all, enough so to cause the Violet Fate Sect disciples to walk over. This matter would surely be talked about near and far, and his standing in the Sect would change immediately. His name would be known throughout the entire Cultivation world of the State of Zhao.</p>
 <p>It seemed that to Meng Hao, what was happening was no big deal. He smiled, looking like he didn’t care at all. As the young man in expensive clothes moved forward to greet the white-robed Cultivators, the State of Zhao disciples followed. The female disciples among them looked especially excited.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s eyes flickered. He pulled the iron spear out of the ground, and then turned to leave.</p>
 <p>“Daoist Brothers from the Violet Fate Sect, I, Sun, shall treat you to a feast in the Phoenix Heaven Restaurant,” said Sun Hua, his expression one of extreme excitement and pride. “Fellow State of Zhao disciples, please join me in receiving the brothers from the Violet Fate Sect.” The collection of Cultivators behind him made the image even more distinct. Coupled with his excited expression, it was clear that he was taking the lead among the State of Zhao disciples.</p>
 <p>Even as the words left his mouth, and he bowed with cupped hands, the Violet Fate Sect disciples walked past him, not even looking at him. En masse, they passed the entire group without a glance, hurrying quickly forward.</p>
 <p>Sun Hua’s mouth dropped open as he watched this happen, as did the other State of Zhao disciples who were following him.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the person in the lead position of the Violet Fate Sect disciples let out a hearty laugh.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist, please stay,” he said. “Brother, did you just return from the treasure mountain? You have an outstanding demeanor. All of us who witnessed your actions on the mountain hold you in the highest regard. I am Qian Shuihen [1. Qian Shuihen's name in Chinese is 千水痕 qiān shuǐ hén - Qian is a surname which also means "1,000." Shui hen literally means "water mark"] of the Violet Fate Sect. Greetings, Fellow Daoist, may I respectfully ask your esteemed name?”</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist, we’ve been looking for you,” said another. “We never imagined that we would run into you here. Hahaha! If the Fellow Daoist has time, I will send someone to arrange a banquet. I am Lu Song [2. Lu Song's name in Chinese is 吕宋 lǚ sòng - Lu is a common surname. Song has no real meaning. It's the same "Song" as the Song Dynasty] of the Violet Fate Sect. Please, allow me to treat you to a feast.”</p>
 <p>Among the ten or more Violet Fate Sect disciples, these two had the highest Cultivation bases. They were at the eighth level of Qi Condensation. Faces filled with smiles, they hurried in front of Meng Hao, blocking his way. The spoke with utmost politeness, and when they approached, they saluted with clasped hands. When the State of Zhao disciples saw this happening; their faces filled with awe and veneration.</p>
 <p>An almost imperceptible frown appeared on Meng Hao’s face, but quickly disappeared. He smiled, and returned a polite salute. He mumbled his name unclearly, although he knew that even though he didn’t say it clearly, these people could search him easily if they wanted to.</p>
 <p>The State of Zhao Cultivators watched on in disbelief. Their heads spun as they watched the Violet Fate Sect disciples chatting in this way to Meng Hao.</p>
 <p>This was especially true of Sun Hua, whose face went through a series of different expressions. He was insulted, of course, and watched Meng Hao with a look of disbelief.</p>
 <p>He knew that the white-robed Cultivators were from the Violet Fate Sect in the Southern Domain. They were proud and arrogant, considering themselves to be unmatched in the world. And yet, they were incredibly polite to Meng Hao, and their eyes were filled with veneration.</p>
 <p>Although he wasn’t quite sure what had just happened, cold sweat broke out on his forehead when he saw them being so polite. He realized that if he had made a move just now to test out the spear, he would most likely have lost a lot of face.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Zhou Kai looked on, dumbfounded. Originally, he had regretted calling out Meng Hao’s name, but watching this scene unfold, his eyes filled with admiration.</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Meng really did deserve to be an Inner Sect disciple. It’s a good thing I gave him those Spirit Stones back then. The Sect was dissolved, and we were kicked away like stray dogs, but he’s still out stirring up trouble. And somehow he’s got the disciples from one of the great Sects of the Southern Domain to treat him so well.” Zhou Kai sighed inwardly.</p>
 <p>Up in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, Qiao Ling blinked a few times, watching in disbelief as the Violet Fate Sect disciples surrounded Meng Hao. When she saw him speaking calmly with them, she couldn’t forget what had happened moments ago between her and Meng Hao. Her interest in him was piqued even more.</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Meng,” said Qian Shuihen, shifting the conversation topic to the spear in Meng Hao’s hand. “Is this the treasured holy spear you used to rebuke the Demonic beasts on the treasure mountain?” He had looked the spear over just now, but it didn’t seem to have any extraordinary qualities. And yet he clearly remembered how Meng Hao had wielded it to bloody so many Demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>“Of course it is,” said Lu Song, laughing. “Your actions on the mountain that day left me in complete veneration of you. Elder Brother Meng, there’s no reason to deny it.”</p>
 <p>A strange look appeared in Meng Hao’s eyes, but only for a moment. He smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>“Yes, this is the spear I used that day on the mountain,” he said candidly.</p>
 <p>“This spear can only be called a great treasure,” said Lu Song. “I saw you use it to injure many Demonic beasts. Countless, in fact. Elder Brother Meng’s mighty actions have replayed themselves constantly in my mind.” He glanced at the spear, his eyes burning. Then he looked over coldly at Qian Shuihen, and the two of them locked gazes. They clearly didn’t like each other, and both of them knew that the other was determined to come out on top.</p>
 <p>When the State of Zhao Cultivators heard all of this, their gazes were drawn to the iron spear. Their original intention had been to examine this treasure of Meng Hao’s. As of now, they didn’t need to. If the Violet Fate Sect disciples were convinced of its power, then it must be true.</p>
 <p>Sun Hua’s eyes gleamed, and he walked forward a few steps, staring at the iron spear.</p>
 <p>“Although, I do have to say,” laughed Lu Song with a shake of his head, “Elder Brother Meng, you really threw our trial by fire into chaos. You took so many medicinal pills, Spirit Stones and magical items from the treasure mountain….” From his expression, it seemed he didn’t mind.</p>
 <p>“Oh that….” Meng Hao laughed, taking a few steps back.</p>
 <p>“It’s no matter,” said Qian Shuihen, taking a few steps forward, eyes on the spear. “That treasure mountain belongs to Eccentric Song, and he shot his mouth off, saying that anyone with the skills could take whatever they want. Actually, Elder Brother Meng’s actions left me feeling immensely satisfied. But… Elder Brother Meng, regarding this spear; would you be willing to offer it up for sale? The Violet Fate Sect would be willing to offer a fair price for it!” Because Meng Hao held it in his hand, Qian Shuihen had no way to thoroughly inspect it. Because he was not at the Foundation Establishment stage, he didn’t have Spiritual Sense, and therefore no way to sense the minute details.</p>
 <p>“Well….” Meng Hao looked hesitant.</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Meng,” said Lu Song, his eyes glittering. “This spear is really very important to us. Please, allow yourself to part with it!” He knew that the first objective was to force Meng Hao into agreeing. Then he and Qian Shuihen would have to battle it out. He took a step forward as he spoke, an overbearing air filling his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Eccentric Song treats people wickedly and mercilessly. You took away many of his most prized treasures. If our Violet Fate Sect’s Elder Wu hadn’t held him back, Elder Brother Meng would be in quite a bit of danger right now.” Qian Shuihen advanced further, his bearing extremely overbearing. At this point, he made no effort to conceal his power and might as he spoke.</p>
 <p>The other Violet Fate Sect disciples slowly moved forward, forming a circle around them. Their eyes gleamed with the desire to lay hands on the spear.</p>
 <p>“This spear is just an ordinary item,” said Meng Hao, looking around at the circle of people, then turning back to Lu Song and Qian Shuihen with a frown.</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Meng, there’s no need for jokes,” said Lu Song with a laugh, his eyes moving over the haft of the spear. “I know I’m not mistaken. This is the spear that you used. That notch in the side, I saw it clearly that day.”</p>
 <p>Meng Hao stared blankly. It seemed this person had looked at the spear even more closely than he had. He hadn’t notice any notch before, but now that he looked, sure enough, there it was.</p>
 <p>When Lu Song saw his expression, it only served to further his certainty. Though he wore a smile on his face, his eyes were cold. He wasn’t allowed to kill Meng Hao to earn a spot in the Inner Sect, but could use other means, and he wouldn’t hold back.</p>
 <p>“Even if it’s only an ordinary object, we still wish to buy it,” said Qian Shuihen threateningly, his voice even colder than before. “We are determined to have this spear. Please, Elder Brother Meng, don’t make things difficult for us, otherwise, we will be very displeased, and you will be too. You might have the spear in hand, but the Violet Fate Sect is one of the five great Sects of the Southern Domain. Even this far away, our power is greater than you can imagine, Fellow Daoist. Furthermore… it’s not we who want the spear, but rather Sect Elder Wu.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, the State of Zhao Cultivators all exchanged glances. Their faces lit up with sneers for Meng Hao, but they maintained their silence.</p>
 <p>Sun Hua’s smile was especially wide. Gaining the help of these people to get information about the spear was a good thing. Regardless of what happened in the end, he should be able to take advantage of the situation to make a move. Furthermore, despite Meng Hao having a treasured spear, he wouldn’t dare to offend a great sect from the Southern Domain.</p>
 <p>“If I don’t agree, will you force me?” asked Meng Hao, his gaze growing grim.</p>
 <p>“Our Sect doesn’t steal treasures from people,” said Lu Song with a laugh. “But Elder Brother Meng should think things through carefully. What good will it do you to offend us? Furthermore… if we really wanted to steal the spear, we could get other people to do it for us. We wouldn’t have to do anything.” He glanced over at the State of Zhao disciples standing a short distance away and nodded. Sun Hua and the others suddenly looked very excited.</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Meng, I, Qian, very much admire your performance on the treasure mountain. But let’s not beat around the bush. Whether or not you want to sell the spear, you will!” His eyes were grim, and his words cold.</p>
 <p>Meng Hao’s heart groaned. If these people wanted to bring trouble upon themselves, he wouldn’t stop them. A variety of expressions crossed his face, and he retreated a few more steps back, muttering to himself. Then, gritting his teeth, he lifted his head. His eyes were bloodshot.</p>
 <p>“Esteemed Violet Fate Sect disciples. If you truly wish to purchase my spear, please, name your price.” Meng Hao flicked his sleeve, stabbing the spear into the ground. His face seemed to be grim and filled with pain.</p>
