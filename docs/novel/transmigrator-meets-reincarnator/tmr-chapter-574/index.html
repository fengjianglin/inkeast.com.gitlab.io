 <p><strong>Chapter 574: Countess Jing'an Takes Over (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What else could Countess Jing’an say? Matriarch He was using her responsibility as a daughter-in-law to pressure her. If she didn’t take over the management of the household, then she would be deemed unfilial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While standing beside them, Chu Lian frowned slightly. She didn’t understand Matriarch He’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she wanted to speak up for her mother-in-law, the matriarch and Madam Liu were both her elders. She was in no position to speak right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an was soft-hearted. She didn’t dare to disobey the matriarch upfront. Thus, she reluctantly agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t decline because she didn’t have any legitimate reason to refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t managed the household in the past because she had been seriously ill and she didn’t have the energy to do it. She had even needed the matriarch’s help to take care of her. However, her health had significantly improved. Since the matriarch had personally requested to hand over the rights of managing the household to her, she didn’t have any good reason to decline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an grasped the handkerchief in her hand, stood up, and bobbed towards the matriarch. “Mother, please rest assured. I’ll do my best to manage the household.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and stand up. You’ve just recovered, so there’s no need to keep bowing like that. Well then, I’ll rest easy now that you’ll be taking care of the household affairs. If you have any questions, feel free to ask Muxiang and Miss Ying.” A smile finally appeared on the matriarch’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Countess Jing’an returned to her courtyard with several maidservants in tow, each carrying a stack of account books.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian followed behind her mother-in-law. She noticed that the countess was frowning deeply, appearing laden with worry. Chu Lian tried to console her. “Mother, you don’t have to worry too much. We don’t have that many people in our estate. There’s only a head steward and an assisting steward in the outer court. There are also plenty of senior servants acting as stewards in the inner court. As long as you keep these people in check and you look over the account books thoroughly, there shouldn’t be any major problems.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an was a little embarrassed. She smiled apologetically at Chu Lian and said, “I’m really useless. At this age, I still need reassurance from a young girl like you. Don’t worry, I’m not that easily fooled. When I married into House Jing’an, I did manage the household for several years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that Mother thinks of it this way. If you need any help, you can send someone to Songtao Court to find me. I don’t have much to do anyway. Although I’ve never managed a household before, I can help you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an felt more relaxed after Chu Lian’s offer of help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She nodded and told her to return to her courtyard to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She patted Chu Lian’s hand and said, “Alright, it’s just some minor household affairs. I have senior servants who can assist me as well, so I’ll be fine. You should concentrate on nourishing your body. I’m still waiting for my grandsons!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s face immediately reddened due to her mother-in-law’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had never thought about having children at such a young age. Back then, she had even thought about finding a nice and quiet place to live out a rural lifestyle in seclusion. However, with the passage of time and the progression of her relationship with He Changdi, she was actually starting to hope that a child would form in her belly as soon as possible. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She and He Changdi could watch their adorable little child grow up, bit by bit. They could raise him or her together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sending Chu Lian off with her servants, Madam Liu returned to her own courtyard and headed directly for her study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had much to do today, and she wasn’t going to have any free time to take care of her granddaughters. Countess Jing’an sat in front of her desk and flipped open the account books. It didn’t take long before she discovered many suspicious gaps in them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was dumbfounded after making a rough calculation of the estate’s assets. Why were there so few stores and properties left in the public accounts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging by these calculations, the monthly income probably wouldn’t even hit five hundred taels…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, that was under the assumption that the stores were turning a profit…</span></p>
