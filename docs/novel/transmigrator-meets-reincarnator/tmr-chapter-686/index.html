 <p><strong>Chapter 686: Baby Moving (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first three months, He Changdi had still obediently slept on the chaise beside the bed. However, now he refused to let her sleep alone in bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the protests of the two senior servants, He Changdi had removed the chaise by the bed and was now hugging her to sleep every night. He would even help her turn around at times. Sometimes, when it came to midnight, Chu Lian would suffer cramping in her legs. Since she slept in his arms, the moment she moved, he would wake immediately and help her with the cramps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time passed and he became used to his ‘work’, Chu Lian was starting to feel that her husband had become even better than Xiyan at taking care of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was still in the midst of a daze. She turned to look up at He Changdi with blank eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Changdi noticed that there wasn't any pain in her expression, he first heaved a sigh of relief before placing a kiss on her cheek. He lowered his voice and whispered gently into her ear, “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something moved within her bloated belly again. This time, Chu Lian was completely sure of what was going on. She came back to her senses and burst into a wide smile. She replied He Changdi with an equally soft voice, “Hubby, he’s moving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The novice dad was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile on Chu Lian’s face widened into a grin until her eyes were sparkling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pulled He Changdi’s hand over and set it down on her belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little bun then helpfully gave another tiny kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was trained in martial arts, so his five senses were stronger than most. He could clearly feel a bump suddenly appearing on the smooth skin he was touching, before subsiding back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reacted just like Chu Lian had and froze up entirely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cracks started appearing in his frozen expression as he processed what was going on. The weird look on his face made Chu Lian burst out into peals of bell-like laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She covered He Changdi’s hand with her own and wrapped her other arm around his neck. She looked up at him, full of smiles, as she continued watching his expression change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time she had felt the baby move in her whole pregnancy. Being able to share in this moment with her loved one was a different sort of bliss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi gulped hard. His normally clear eyes were now clouded over in bewilderment. He asked stupidly, “This is our child moving?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded with a smile, “The little fellow is saying his to his dad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she was talking, He Changdi could feel another bump under his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the baby kicked much harder than before. Perhaps he had sensed his dear dad on the other side, so he wasn't holding back in the last. The force of this kick made Chu Lian gasp a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s expression immediately turned into a frown upon seeing this. His face turned somewhat overcast as he asked, “Does it hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shook her head, “I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi rubbed a circle around his wife’s belly, “Why is this rascal so disobedient?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile dropped from Chu Lian’s face and she rolled her eyes at her husband, “He’s only a few months old, it’s just a subconscious reaction from our little fellow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi let out a cold chuckle, which sent a chill down Chu Lian’s spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He doesn’t know how to take care of you even while in your belly. Well, let’s see how I’ll take care of him when he’s out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A twitch developed in the corner of Chu Lian’s mouth, “Are there any dads like you? He hasn’t even been born yet and you’re already thinking of how to discipline him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He should be glad he’s not out yet, or it won’t just be a verbal threat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had no words to reply to that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, perhaps the little fellow had realised that he was being threatened by his dear old dad. Later on, whenever He Changdi was by Chu Lian’s side, he refused to move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing far off behind the corner of a wall, Muxiang stared at the happy couple hugging in the pavilion with dead eyes. Her lip was already red from how hard she was biting it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a poisonous look in her eyes. She wanted Chu Lian to just fall right into the lotus pond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her fists were already clenched so tight that her nails were digging into the flesh of her palm, while her expression was contorted into an ugly mask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been enduring for all this time, but it was finally time to take action. In this lifetime, anyone who stole away her ‘husband’ would die a gruesome death! Even if it was someone in her previous body!</span></p>
