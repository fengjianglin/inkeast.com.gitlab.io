 <p><strong>Chapter 690: Who Are You? (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the halfway mark up the mountain, Muxiang noticed a signal hidden in the bushes and made a discreet hand gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A group of masked men on horses abruptly charged out from either side of the silent mountain road. They immediately got into a skirmish with the guards of the Anyuan Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the strong masked men, wearing a short tunic with bunched up sleeves, charged straight towards Countess Jing’an with his sword drawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing had been about to rush to Chu Lian’s side, but she had no choice but to draw her own sword and block the man’s attack for the countess instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clashing of swords resounded in the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muxiang was shouting for the guards to protect Chu Lian, but Laiyue and their stronger guards were all blocked by the masked men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palanquin that Chu Lian was seated in was stolen away by the two grey-clad porters carrying her. Another man stuffed a rag in Muxiang’s mouth and carried her away with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The masked men seemed to lose all desire to fight once they had completed the kidnapping. One of their leaders made a hand signal, and the group of masked men dispersed just as quickly as they had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just a short fifteen minutes, there was only a group of injured guards and the shell-shocked Countess Jing’an left at the halfway mark of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Countess Jing’an realised that Chu Lian had been kidnapped, she collapsed to the ground in fright and roared angrily, “Chase them down! No matter what, you have to bring Sanlang’s wife back safely in one piece!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice was trembling as she gave orders to Laiyue, “Hurry, send some men to pass the news to Third Young Master, Master and Prince Wei’s Estate! Quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their family soldier, Huang Zhijian, had already led a party of guards after the kidnappers. Laiyue quickly instructed some men to send the report. He didn’t dare to lead the pursuit himself at the moment since Countess Jing’an was still here. They had already lost one of their madams, they couldn’t let anything happen to the other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So her two porters had been part of the setup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked around her surroundings constantly, but since this was the forested area of Mount Lanxiang, other than bushes and trees, there was nothing she could use as landmarks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pressed her lips and accidentally brushed against the pouch at her waist, causing some tiny fragments to fall out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under these pressing circumstances, no one noticed the light-coloured powder falling from Chu Lian’s ouch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned her gaze to Muxiang, who had been tied up and was being carried on someone’s shoulder. The maidservant’s head had been covered by a cloth bag, so she couldn’t see the servant’s expression at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what seemed strange to Chu Lian was how Muxiang had reacted at first. She had struggled with all her might at the start, but after they had left the line of sight of Laiyue and the others, Muxiang had suddenly stopped moving as if she had fainted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two porters carrying the palanquin were sprinting madly. Chu Lian didn’t dare to do anything but hold on to the palanquin for dear life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, once the kidnappers had lost the guards in pursuit and made a long detour around the forest to throw them off, they stopped by a thatched hut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian and Muxiang were pushed into the single room of the hut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an old, scarred set of desk and chairs in the room. Other than a pile of hay in the corner, there was nothing else. This crude hut consisted of a single narrow door without any windows, making the entire room seem especially dim and damp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian used the mud wall to help herself up and stood facing the pile of hay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The kidnappers had all retreated out of the room after tossing Chu Lian and Muxiang inside, and they were guarding the hut from twenty metres or so away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian frowned. Her eyes quickly landed upon Muxiang, whose head was still covered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The supposedly unconscious Muxiang suddenly started moving. She untied the ropes restraining her hands in a few quick movements and pulled off the bag covering her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, her friendly-looking face was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her expression was completely different from the usual kind and submissive Muxiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What showed on her face was a sinister light. The corners of her mouth were twisted into a smirk, and there was a darkness in her eyes now. She seemed like a completely different person, without the slightest shadow of the previous Muxiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The furrow between Chu Lian’s brows deepened. Her red lips were slightly parted. It was clear that she was still recovering from her shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She gulped subconsciously, “Who… Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gears in Chu Lian’s head turned. This group of masked men had kidnapped her and left her alone with Muxiang in this thatched hut. Could all this have been set up by Muxiang?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, why had the kidnappers only taken away the two of them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muxiang stood up and walked a few steps towards Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no longer any remnants of the obedient maidservant in the Muxiang before her. She swayed confidently with every step, her chin raised high and arrogance radiating from her every pore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smirked deeper as she stared down Chu Lian, who was standing up against the wall. She even bent down a little to get closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muxiang was originally tall and slender. At this moment, standing in front of the shorter and smaller Chu Lian, she was at least half a head taller. After reincarnating into this body, Muxiang experienced the sweet feeling of looking down on someone else for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She let out an uncanny laugh. Her tone carried hatred even as she spoke mockingly, “Hah? Who am I? That’s what I should be asking you instead, Marchioness Anyuan! Who are </span><i><span style>you</span></i><span style>? Don’t you feel the slightest bit of shame having stolen this body? Aren’t you even a little guilty after stealing someone else’s husband and hiding the truth? You monster! I’d like to see how long you’re going to keep up this pretense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill ran up Chu Lian’s spine as she stared up at Muxiang with wide eyes. Muxiang stared right back at her with an expression warped with anger.</span></p>
