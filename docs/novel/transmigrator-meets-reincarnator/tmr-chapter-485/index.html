 <p><strong>Chapter 485: Considerate (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pouted, buried her face into the front of his robes, and said in a slightly muffled voice, “Hubby, Grandmother doesn’t like me anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had been using a questioning tone earlier, but now she was stating a fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t stupid. Despite the Matriarch’s attempt at acting as per normal, she had still been able to sense that something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When someone truly cared for you, you would be able to sense it in their gaze, their actions, their words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just Chu Lian who had this feeling; He Changdi felt the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His brows wrinkled slightly and he thought of the movements in the estate during the past two days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had suffered on the trip to the north and she had even succeeded in bringing back the medicinal ingredient needed to cure his mother. Grandmother wasn’t an unreasonable person, so she should be treating Chu Lian even more dearly. Why had she become cold and distant instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>There had to be some external factor influencing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s pupils dilated as he sunk deep into his thoughts. When a sudden notion came to him, his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After his past life, He Changdi knew how important it was to make sure that there were no conflicts between even the closest of families. Otherwise, the gaps in their hearts would give rise to internal family troubles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandmother was aging and his aunt was right by her side. Many things were different from his past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He comforted his wife by stroking her back with his palm. His heart steeled with resolution as he made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lian’er, what do you think happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s brows formed a frown. She sat up and straightened her posture before sharing her analysis with him. “Hubby, could it be... Uncle Mo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang looked at her with undisguised admiration, as they had reached the same conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about this, I’ll handle it. As for Grandmother, she’s old and may have become muddleheaded, so don’t take her actions to heart. I’m the one who you’re spending the rest of your life with, not her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian knew that He Sanlang was right, but feeling alienated from the matriarch for no reason left a bad taste in her mouth. In the past, she may not have cared about this, but since she wanted to pass her days happily with He Changdi and help him manage the family, it was hard for her to stay positive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a granddaughter-in-law, she didn’t want to be disliked by her grandmother-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian puffed up her cheeks and said, “But I’m still unhappy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi understood his wife’s train of thought. It was precisely because she cared about him that she wanted the approval of all of his relatives, and to be on equal footing with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The caring consideration from his wife warmed He Sanlang’s heart. Her cute, chubby, puffed up cheeks gave him a sudden urge… He let out a low chuckle and pulled her closer. With just a simple tilt of his head, his lips were already covering her pout. He tasted her smooth, sweet lips before pushing past them and plundering her mouth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian ran out of air, she pushed at his chest and he finally released her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still have the strength to get angry now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s lips had turned red from his bullying. She glared at him with her clear eyes and said, “He Changdi, you’re getting more and more out of hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s icy face broke into a smile that resembled a warm breeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chu Lian was still displeased with him, she couldn’t bear to spoil this relaxed expression of his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that she had become estranged from the matriarch, albeit through no fault of her own, he was the one stuck in the middle. Things would be tough for him in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s heart ached for her grim-faced husband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stroked He Sanlang’s cheek and said softly, “Forget about it. I’m not made of gold, so I can’t be liked by everyone. I can’t control how Grandmother thinks either, but I’ll be fine as long as my conscience is clear. You don’t have to think too much about this. We’re not living our lives for others to see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang hadn’t expected Chu Lian to be able to let the matter go. His heart was instantly enveloped in warmth that he had never felt before.</span></p>
