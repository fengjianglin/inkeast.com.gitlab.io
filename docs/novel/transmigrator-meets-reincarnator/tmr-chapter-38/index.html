 <p><strong>Chapter 38: Not Letting You Eat (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky had already turned dark. Chu Lian had already returned to the Ying Estate today, and had been surrounded by a group of women she didn’t know. She didn’t have much of an appetite, and so hadn’t eaten much today. By the time she had returned to the Jing’an Estate, she was already starving. However, because of the fire, she had completely forgotten about her hunger. By now, her stomach was growling in protest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian leaned against the couch, comedy book still in hand. She was bored while waiting for dinner time, so she had already showered and changed into her sleeping clothes. However, there was still no sign of dinner in sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t right! Her sister-in-law, Madam Zou, was the conscientious sort. The two of them hadn’t eaten dinner yet, and Eldest Sister-in-Law couldn’t have possibly forgotten about them. Not to mention, there was still Matriarch He...</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the day of the tea ceremony, Chu Lian had discovered that Matriarch He was really sweet on her youngest grandson. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian couldn’t wait any longer. She shouted for Xiyan, who was in the outer chamber. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan quickly walked in. “Third Young Madam, do you have any orders?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go ask and see if dinner has been sent over. I’m hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiyan bobbed in acknowledgement, she went out to find out what happened to their meal. She returned as quickly as she left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While leaning against her red pillow as she read her comedy, Chu Lian casually asked, “So, how did it go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan had a conflicted expression on her face and didn’t know what to say. After a moment, when she didn’t hear any reply from her, Chu Lian cast her gaze over in curiosity. “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only then that Xiyan reported how Laiyue had stolen their food delivery away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan felt aggrieved inside. How could Third Young Master keep making things difficult for Third Young Madam? He wouldn’t even let her have a proper meal! She was faring even worse than in the Ying Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gaped in astonishment, her black eyes shining and full of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang was way too childish! So he wasn’t going to let her eat at all?! Was he trying to starve her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian rolled her eyes and didn’t think much of it. She didn’t notice the aggrievement and unhappiness in Xiyan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiyan, go to the study and ask Third Young Master about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan agreed and left with a gloomy face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the study, Laiyue felt like banging his head against the wall. He was forced to face the red-eyed maidservant as she complained about the unfair treatment of her mistress. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“My dear ancestor<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, it isn’t that I don’t want to let you in, but I have my orders.” After saying so, Laiyue pointed in the direction of Chu Lian’s bedroom and lowered his voice. “Young Master said not to let anyone in, even if it’s Third Young Madam.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan bit her lip as tears were about to fall from her eyes. “What has Third Young Madam done wrong, that Third Young Master is treating her this way? Our madam is starving right now, and you don’t seem to care at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue felt a headache coming on. “Miss Xiyan, I’m begging you, please don’t make things difficult for me. I’m just a servant like you. How could I disobey my master’s orders?”</span></p>
