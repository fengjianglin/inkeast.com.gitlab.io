 <p><strong>Chapter 509: Dealing with Her (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian really didn’t know if she should cry or laugh. She presented her pale, smooth palm to He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?” He Changdi pretended not to understand his wife’s meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the letter? I want to read it. I want to see what nonsense that Xiao Bojian was trying to pull!” Chu Lian was about to explode in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of situation was this? Why did it feel like she had been wronged through no fault of her own?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hand was beginning to feel sore from being held out so long, but He Changdi didn’t move an inch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to see the letter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian reminded him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi awkwardly coughed a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to avoid meeting his wife’s questioning gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gaped in shock. Disbelieving, she asked, “Don’t tell me you destroyed the letter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang awkwardly turned his head away. He pursed his lips without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian noticed his evasive gaze and knew that she had hit the nail on the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger flared up within her, giving her the urge to punch him a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She puffed up her cheeks and glared at He Changdi with her big eyes for a long moment. Finally, Chu Lian angrily turned her back to He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only at this moment that He Changdi finally realised that he had been too impulsive earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was absolutely no way he could have controlled the rage and jealousy in his heart while holding a letter from his love rival in his hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi knew he had made a mistake. He reached out, wanting to turn Chu Lian around to face him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian wasn’t willing to let him have his way and stubbornly ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang knew his wife was really angry with him, so he didn’t dare to use force. He could only lightly pet her back, like he was trying to soothe a grumpy little kitten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t want to continue like this for long, so she said, “Go wash up first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi stared at the side profile of his wife’s face for a while before he got up and went to the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s mood was slightly better when she didn’t hear him call for the maidservants outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She laid on her side, wrapped inside the soft blankets, and thought about the things that He Changdi had just told her. She was really curious about what Xiao Bojian had written in the letter that Fuyan had been keeping. Also, how had Fuyan gotten hold of that letter? It was too bad that He Changdi had already burned it. She couldn’t even read it if she wanted to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps due to having waited late into the night for He Changdi to come to bed, or perhaps from all the tiring activities today, Chu Lian ended up falling asleep mid-contemplation...</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Sanlang came out of the bathroom, the first thing he noticed was his wife’s sweet sleeping visage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t get into bed immediately. Instead, he sat by the bedside for a long time, dressed only in a thin sleeping gown. His shadowed eyes stayed on Chu Lian’s gentle face. It was as if he wanted to engrave her face into his heart, so that he would never forget it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he finally laid down and embraced the petite woman beside him, the night had already passed. Slivers of light were creeping up over the horizon to the east.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, when the young couple ate breakfast together, the atmosphere between them had become a lot more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was such a surprise that Senior Servant Gui even purposely asked Wenlan about it in private.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian and He Changdi finished their breakfast and the maidservants had cleared the table, He Changdi asked Chu Lian a question as she was sipping some honey water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you planning to deal with Fuyan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that they had lured all the perpetrators out from hiding, the couple didn’t need to continue acting at odds anymore, so their interactions were naturally more intimate than yesterday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the tension from their quarrel in the carriage still hadn’t been dispelled completely. Thus, there was still a tiny bit of distance between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian understood her own shortcomings. She wasn’t someone born and raised during the Great Wu Dynasty, so it was inevitable that she would be too soft-hearted at times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You decide what to do with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi looked up to meet her eyes. “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll be too severe with her? Despite everything, she has been serving you since your maiden days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shook her head. “Since I’ve already handed her over to you, do with her as you see fit. If you leave it to me, it might cause us some trouble in the future.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang dropped the topic. “Alright. Since you’ve handed her over to me, don’t ask about it anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian and He Changdi were still talking when a maidservant came in to report that Matriarch He had requested the couple to go over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple exchanged looks. They returned to their room to change before going to Qingxi Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was still rather early. It wasn’t even time yet for the usual morning greetings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the family was already present by the time the young couple arrived at Qingxi Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Countess Jing’an was only a few moments behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple from the main branch was also present. Madam Zou had a terrible expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He’s eyes turned towards Chu Lian and He Changdi right after they came in. She calmly said, “Take a seat. I’ve called everyone here to conclude last night’s incident.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch didn’t say anything else. She looked like she was waiting for someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian quickly found out who she was waiting for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few minutes later, Great Doctor Miao strode in, carrying his medicine box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After staying up for the whole night, Great Doctor Miao’s complexion wasn’t very good. However, he seemed to be in a rather relaxed mood. Based on his expression, Chu Lian could guess that Miaozhen and her child were already fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, Great Doctor Miao cupped his hands together in a greeting when he entered the parlour. He stroked his white beard as he said, “Miss Miaozhen is fine now. If she takes in proper nourishment and takes care of her health in the coming days, she will be able to give birth to her child without any problems.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He and Countess Jing’an’s faces were naturally filled with joy after hearing his report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This was all thanks to Great Doctor Miao.” Matriarch He bowed to express her humble gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Great Doctor Miao’s expression remained rather blasé. There wasn’t any fear on his face as he remarked, “This old man thinks that the matriarch is thanking the wrong person. The one you should thank is Third Young Madam.”</span></p>
