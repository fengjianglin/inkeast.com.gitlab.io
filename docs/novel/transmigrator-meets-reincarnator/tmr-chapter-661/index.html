 <p><strong>Chapter 661: Pregnant (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt uncomfortable under his direct gaze. Her face instantly flushed and she turned her head away to avoid his eyes, but He Changdi caught hold of her chin and started raining kisses on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He started at the corner of her lips, then sucked on her full bottom lip and nibbled on it. Just as he was about to push deeper into her mouth, He Changdi seemed to recall something and quickly let go of Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still immersed in the steamy bout of affection, Chu Lian couldn’t make sense of what happened. Her originally bashful eyes fluttered open and she turned her confused, misty gaze upon He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s heart softened and he stroked her smooth, reddened cheeks lovingly. “I have a cold. I’m afraid I’ll pass it to you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was then that Chu Lian found out why he had suddenly moved away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pressed her pink lips together. Using He Changdi’s momentary distraction, she raised her body and attacked his thin, slightly pale lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her little lithe tongue reached into his mouth, twisting around in exploration. He Changdi stiffened at the intrusion as the desire in his eyes thickened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thirst he had tried to resist was back in full force thanks to Chu Lian’s simple gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he delved deeper into their kiss, He Changdi heard the woman in his arms say in a slightly muffled voice, “I’m not afraid of a cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A corner of his lips hooked up in a smile as he turned the tables on his invader and completely dominated her mouth in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their battle continued until Chu Lian was gasping for breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi loosened his hold on her a little. Her sweet, fragrant breath fanned out in puffs right against his nose. He continuously placed tiny kisses at the corners of her mouth and cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian took a breather as she laid bonelessly against He Changdi’s shoulders. It took some time before the flush on her cheeks faded away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither of them broke the silence. Instead, they took comfort from leaning on each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t long before Chu Lian dozed off, still leaning against He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time their carriage reached the Anyuan Estate, darkness had already fallen outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Chu Lian was still sleeping soundly in his arms, He Changdi couldn’t bear to wake her. He wrapped her up tightly in his cloak and carried her into the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even before they had reached the main courtyard they shared, Chu Lian had already woken up. However, thanks to He Changdi’s bold actions, she was too shy to open her eyes and continued feigning sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main courtyard of their new estate was still called Songtao Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once He Changdi entered their courtyard, he ordered the servants to call for Great Doctor Miao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Chu Lian had been in the pink of health initially, she had suffered some damage on the trip to the north. It had taken a period of nourishment in order to get her health back to normal. This time, she had also suffered some fright at the hunting grounds. Although the imperial physicians had given her a clean bill of health, He Sanlang was still worried for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he asked for Great Doctor Miao to take a look at Chu Lian the moment they were home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they had moved out of the Jing’an Estate, Great Doctor Miao had followed them to the Anyuan Estate. Chu Lian had arranged for Great Doctor Miao to have his own courtyard and even a special medicine room. At his age, Great Doctor Miao didn’t have much that he was interested in, aside from medicine and good food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the small and simple family of House Anyuan and Chu Lian’s cooking, the Anyuan Estate was the ideal living space for Great Doctor Miao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Great Doctor Miao was rather grateful to the couple. When He Changdi requested his presence, he came quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian ‘woke up’ when she arrived back at Songtao Court. Since the ones serving in Songtao Court were all her close servants, she didn’t have anything to be embarrassed about around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She gave a slight cough to hide her remaining awkwardness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When Uncle Miao comes over later, let him check your pulse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eternal ice on He Changdi’s face seemed to have melted away completely. There was a slight smirk in its place, and he simply nodded in reply to her request without any contest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui had already taken Jingyan and Wenlan with her to the kitchen to cook dinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Doctor Miao was still strong and healthy despite his age, and he arrived at Songtao Court with his medicine box in no time. The moment he entered the parlour, he saw Chu Lian and He Changdi sitting at the head of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His first reaction was to give them a glare and lightly admonish them. “What did you do to yourselves? Wasn’t it supposed to be a simple trip out? Look at what’s happened to you both! Others might think that you’ve gone to battle instead of just hunting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple had been around Great Doctor Miao for some time now, so they treated him like a senior member of their family. When Great Doctor Miao reprimanded them like this, all they could do was smile sheepishly back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Doctor Miao set his medicine box on the table and sat down with an air of authority. He faced the couple and asked, “Who’s first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned to look at He Changdi, who took the hint and walked over to Great Doctor Miao’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Doctor Miao took up his hand and remained silent as he read He Changdi’s pulse. After a short while, he said, “It’s nothing major; you caught a cold from the weather because your body wasn’t in the best condition. You tired yourself out and put stress on your body by worrying too much. Just have a good night’s rest and take some medicine and you’ll be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, Great Doctor Miao turned his attention to Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, how about you? How did you get yourself into this state? I just got you back to good health and this is how you repay me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian lowered her head in shame from the doctor’s scolding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi quickly tried to defend his wife. “Uncle Miao, it’s all my fault. Don’t scold Lian’er.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Doctor Miao harrumphed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you going to come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi vacated his seat next to Great Doctor Miao, and Chu Lian stood up and sat in He Changdi’s place. She extended a fair wrist and placed it on the handkerchief on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Doctor Miao focused on reading her pulse. Suddenly, he frowned and pressed harder on Chu Lian’s wrist. It took him much longer to read her pulse than he had for He Changdi. He continued checking her pulse for eight whole minutes and even checked both of her wrists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi noticed the grave expression on his face. His heart leaped in alarm. He could barely wait for Great Doctor Miao to finish reading Chu Lian’s pulse before he asked, “Uncle Miao, did something happen to Lian’er?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian hadn’t thought much of the long diagnosis. She hadn’t had much appetite these two days and was a little giddy sometimes. To her, it seemed like the symptoms of low blood sugar. She had eaten more according to what Physician Li had recommended and the symptoms had mostly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Great Doctor Miao was a genius in the medical field, so she started feeling uneasy from how serious he looked.</span></p>
