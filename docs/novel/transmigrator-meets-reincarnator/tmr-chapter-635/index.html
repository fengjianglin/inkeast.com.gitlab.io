 <p><strong>Chapter 635: How Stinky! (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the tent was filled with sounds of merry-making and chatter, a guard posted outside the tent came in to report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi set down his chopsticks and asked with a cold expression, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard was one of He Changdi’s men, so he replied very respectfully, “My lord, Great Steward Wei has arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By Great Steward Wei, the guard was referring to the emperor’s trusted attendant, Eunuch Wei Chenghai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why had he chosen to visit during mealtime?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, everyone in the tent had heard He Changdi’s conversation with the guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They all set down their chopsticks as Eunuch Wei was ushered in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eunuch Wei entered the tent with two younger eunuchs behind him, one of them even carrying a container for food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eunuch Wei first greeted everyone with a bow before smiling as he began to make small talk. “Ah, what a coincidence; even Old Duke Zheng and Your Highness are here! I wonder what delicacy Honoured Lady Jinyi has made this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had mentioned Chu Lian in his question, the task of answering him naturally fell upon her shoulders. “No, no, it wasn’t any sort of delicacy, Eunuch Wei. I only told my maidservants to make a few simple dishes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch’s smile became even warmer. “You must be joking with me, Honoured Lady. I could smell that fragrance from all the way over there. It was quite particular.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian almost choked on her saliva after hearing Eunuch Wei’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shot a nonchalant glance over at the entrance of the tent. Just as the eunuch had said, the emperor’s luxurious tent could be seen not too far away. The easterly winds were blowing today as well, and they had been cooking upwind. No wonder they had been able to smell it from the emperor’s tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If not for Eunuch Wei still present on the scene, Chu Lian might have let herself wear an expression of regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had been observing their interactions and he found Eunuch Wei’s attitude towards his wife rather strange. Before Chu Lian could reply once more, he stepped forward to block her from view. He cut in with, “May I ask what business Gonggong has here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tiny wrinkle developed on Wei Chenghai’s brow. He wasn’t very happy with the way He Changdi had interrupted his and Chu Lian’s conversation. However, he was used to navigating treacherous social waters amongst the officials, so he wouldn’t show this little bit of dissatisfaction on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His lips remained spread in a smile as he said, “Well, it’s rare for such a chance to present itself. His Majesty would also like to try Honoured Lady’s cooking. Thus, I’ve come over shamelessly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eunuch Wei sent a signal at the young eunuch behind him. The young eunuch quickly responded by offering up the food container in his hands. “His Majesty said that we couldn’t let Honoured Lady offer up her food without a gift in return, so this is a reward for Honoured Lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t refuse a gift, especially not something bestowed by the biggest boss in the Great Wu: the emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian received the box with both hands and made her gratitude known. When she turned around, she shot a reassuring look at her husband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian worked swiftly. Since it was something to be served to the emperor, she had to cook it herself. All Wenqing and Wenlan could do was help with some minor tasks at the side. Furthermore, they had to be very careful with something made for the emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, the dishes weren’t very complicated, and she finished cooking in just forty-five minutes. She handed over the food to Eunuch Wei directly, and he quickly left for the emperor’s tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she was done cooking, the others in the tent had already had their fill. Since they still had some hunting to do in the afternoon, everyone quickly dispersed and returned to their own tents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When only Chu Lian and He Changdi were left, Chu Lian opened up the box that Eunuch Wei had sent over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gaped in surprise at the contents. The box was completely filled with birds’ nest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They weren’t the normal grade of birds’ nest either; these were top quality blood birds’ nests, in the most perfect crescent shapes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Products of this quality were usually used as tributes in the Great Wu, and there were very few of them in number. These were sent over from the Xinluo Country every year and only the most esteemed and respected women in the palace could enjoy these.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in the modern world, this kind of birds’ nest was considered extremely rare and precious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would the emperor gift her such valuable items for no reason…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stared at the huge pile of blood birds’ nests with her eyebrows drawn together. She looked up at He Changdi, who seemed to be brooding over the gift as well, and asked, “Hubby, what do you think His Majesty is thinking by sending over such precious gifts…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s profound gaze flickered over to Chu Lian. All the events of today had also left him rather confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He caressed Chu Lian’s cheek gently and shook his head. “I can’t discern His Majesty’s intentions for now. Let’s just wait and watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she couldn’t understand what was going on either, Chu Lian simply set aside her thoughts and ordered Wenqing to put away the top-quality birds’ nest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s give some to Mother when we return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Countess Jing’an’s illness had already been cured, she had struggled with it for so long that her body was sorely lacking in vigour. The nutritious birds’ nest was exactly what she needed to boost her health right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Warmth suffused through He Changdi’s heart. He pulled Chu Lian over into his lap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need. I just sent some medicinal ingredients to Mother a few days ago,” He Changdi explained, raining light kisses down her cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian took his hand and started playing with his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I don’t have any use for this birds’ nest! My body’s perfectly healthy; I don’t need to eat things like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eating nutritious products like birds’ nest when unneeded could instead cause adverse effects to her body and affect her health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, He Changdi didn’t catch Chu Lian’s meaning immediately, and his mind somehow turned on a crooked path instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He bent down closer to her ear and let out a low chuckle. “What, are you worried that you’ll be overly ‘nourished’ again? Don’t worry. With me around, we can work together to extinguish your fires anytime.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was in awe of how He Changdi’s mind could twist anything into something perverted!</span></p>
