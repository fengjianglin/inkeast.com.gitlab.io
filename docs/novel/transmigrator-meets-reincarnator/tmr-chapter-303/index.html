 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 303: The Beardy is He Sanlang (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the two men were bickering, the sound of footsteps came from the cave entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Hongyu noticed that He Changdi's eyes were turning grave, he quickly hit his own head as if he had just remembered something. "That's right, Brother He, I forgot to tell you! Your family's private soldiers came with us. That should be them arriving now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after he finished speaking, a group of men entered the cave. In the lead was Mo Chenggui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Mo Chenggui caught sight of He Sanlang, he ran up to his young master excitedly. He stood in front of the other private soldiers and bowed to He Changdi. "Third Young Master, this old servant is relieved that you're well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps due to the difference in their status, there was no trace of the haughtiness and disdain that Mo Chenggui had shown in front of Chu Lian. These old soldiers who had followed Old Count Jing'an into battle were truly loyal and concerned for the male masters of the He Family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing behind the rest, just a few metres away, Chu Lian was immersed in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her almond-shaped eyes were wide open while her slightly pink lips were parted. A single sentence resonated in her mind: 'The beardy is He Sanlang!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could that be!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes unconsciously fixed on He Changdi, heart pounding in her chest. Whether it was because of the flurry of emotions she was now experiencing at realising the truth, or the perpetual tension and nervousness in her heart ever since being chased by the Tuhuns, Chu Lian knew one thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she remembered all the stupid things she had done in front of He Sanlang while taking him for a stranger, she really just wanted to bury herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As her thoughts ran wild in her mind, she couldn't hold back a glare at He Sanlang. That... that fellow had known all along and had actually teased her on purpose, just to watch her make a fool of herself. How... how utterly shameless!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's face flushed red as her chest heaved with every breath. However, she couldn't reveal the truth in front of these people, so she could only bear with the frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi nodded and replied calmly, "I'm fine, but the war in Liangzhou continues. We have to return quickly."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hongyu had also turned serious. He smiled and nodded at Chu Lian before leading the men out of the cave and ordering someone to bring He Changdi a horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only then that He Sanlang turned to look at Chu Lian and noticed her frustrated expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian knew that she was the one at fault for being face blind and not recognising him, so she felt too embarrassed to be the one to speak first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, when she met with his cold gaze, Chu Lian shifted her eyes away guiltily. He Sanlang stood ramrod straight with his hands behind his back. He continued to stare at her until she could feel goosebumps rising on her skin. Finally, he stalked over to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How impressive, my wife. You didn't even manage to recognise your own husband? Then you should open your eyes a little more and take a good look. Otherwise, you might even take a stranger for your husband next time and put a green hat on my head!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang didn't wait for Chu Lian's fiery gaze to turn onto him again. &nbsp;He swept her up into a princess carry and brought her out of the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was extremely angry, but she couldn't quarrel with her husband in front of so many people. It would be bad for both of their reputations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the most she could do was glare at He Sanlang while remaining silent in his embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, He Changdi could feel the grudge and killer intent in Chu Lian's eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked down coldly at her and said, "If you like to look at me so much, I'll let you have your fill when we get back to Liangzhou!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gritted her teeth and began to inwardly complain to herself. Who's trying to look at him? Only that crazy He Sanlang could say something like that with a straight face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Hongyu saw that He Changdi was carrying Chu Lian out of the cave, a mischievous look lit up his eyes. "Brother He, take good care of Sister-in-Law!" He pointed at a handsome horse nearby. It was all black except for its white tail and hooves. Xiao Hongyu explained, "Brother He, we found your horse for you, but it has quite a few wounds on its body. The wounds were probably made by those damned Tuhuns. You can't ride on this horse for now, so you and Sister-in-Law can take my horse instead. I'll ride with Zhao Liang."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang looked at his beloved steed and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned her gaze curiously towards the handsome black horse. It seemed to be rather intelligent. When it noticed its owner, He Changdi, looking at it, it even whickered at him and blinked its big eyes coquettishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian's eyes followed the curve of the horse's smooth back, she noticed that there were some wounds on the horse's rump and back which had already started to scab over. A small suspicion surfaced in her mind. If she didn't guess wrongly, those wounds weren't made by the Tuhuns- instead, they were likely made by He Changdi himself to drive his steed faster when chasing after her mad horse... </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Chu Lian sent an apologetic look to the horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang personally helped Chu Lian onto Xiao Hongyu's horse before leaping up and sitting behind her. When Zhao Liang saw that the captain was only wearing his armour and that the cloak on the captain's wife was dirtied, he took off his own cloak and passed it to He Sanlang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang gave pause before receiving the cloak. He looked down at the fragile woman before him. He hesitated for a moment, but finally, he wrapped the dark coloured cloak around Chu Lian and made sure she was completely covered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian began to feel warmth return to her, she looked down and noticed the thick cloak on her body. She was about to speak up and thank him, but He Sanlang spoke first. He lowered his voice and said, "You don't have to thank me. I just don't want you to catch a cold and become a burden for me!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>That one sentence made the gratitude in Chu Lian's heart vanish into thin air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian decided to shut her mouth and stop bothering with that crazy husband of hers!</span></p>
