 <p><strong>Chapter 602: The Past is Dead (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count Jing’an harrumphed, clearly disinclined to bother with He Ying and her daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just He Ying and Miss Pan who felt extremely awkward from being ignored, but Matriarch He as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying and Miss Pan had been under her care and protection after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once everyone in the parlour had finished greeting Count Jing’an, it was finally He Dalang’s turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changqi hadn’t seen his father in years. He missed his father just as much as anyone else in the family, but he knew that it was his own fault that his father was coldly ignoring him now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count Jing’an finally cast his gaze upon his disappointing eldest son. Fury and frustration warred within him. In a deep voice, he ordered, “Follow me to the study.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changqi stood up and followed the count out of Qingxi Hall with his head bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that the count had returned, the entire estate was bursting with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The news quickly spread to Countess Jing’an’s courtyard. The countess disregarded her ailing health and immediately tried to get out of bed to see the husband she hadn’t laid eyes upon in years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, He Changdi and Chu Lian arrived just in time to stop her, otherwise the countess might have made her condition worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That night, the entire family gathered in the outer court’s parlour to have a reunion dinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even He Erlang returned to the estate earlier than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The estate was bustling with noise and excitement. It was even livelier than it was on New Year’s Day. The dishes served for dinner were personally cooked by Chu Lian and her handmaids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was fragrant stir-fried pork, spicy stir-fried beef, griddle shredded cabbage, poached fish slices, old duck soup… There were more than ten dishes in total and they were all things that Count Jing’an had never eaten before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the meal, he couldn’t help but compliment his youngest daughter-in-law’s cooking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since his belly was now full with an extremely satisfying reunion dinner, Count Jing’an’s mood was much improved compared to when he was dealing with the mess that Dalang had created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That night, Count Jing’an led his two little granddaughters and his wife back to their courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the main bedroom of Countess Jing’an’s courtyard, the servants had already retreated, leaving the couple to themselves. Their two granddaughters had been taken to bed by their nursemaids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count Jing’an took his wife’s hand and led her to sit by the desk. The couple was very close and they hadn’t met in many years, so they were full of longing. Right now, the two of them had much to say to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The count was the most concerned about his wife’s health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had already received He Changdi’s letter, stating that his wife’s illness had been cured, he couldn’t rest easy without seeing it for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that his previously bedridden wife was standing before him with a pair of healthy, ruddy cheeks, he was elated beyond belief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The burly middle-aged general’s eyes reddened. He gripped his wife’s hand and said, “Peiwen, you’re finally all better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an, Liu Peiwen, smiled along with her husband. “Yes, I’m all better. Those days when I was trapped in bed feel like a dream now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me what the person who healed you is like. Great Doctor Miao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count Jing’an knew roughly how his wife had been cured, but he wasn’t clear on the details involved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an knew that he would ask about it, so she explained the entire situation from start to end patiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took her a whole hour to finish explaining it all. She smiled as she looked at her husband. “It must be the heavens who couldn’t bear to see me lying in bed and helped to cure me earlier so I could welcome you back home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The count chuckled and nodded. He lamented, “Sanlang’s wife is really our He Family’s lucky star. If not for her, Great Doctor Miao wouldn’t have stayed in our estate so readily and helped to cure your illness. Although Mother is getting old and becoming more muddle-headed, she must have been guided by a greater power when she went to plead for this marriage for Sanlang. I’ll go thank Great Doctor Miao myself tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an nodded in agreement. “Yes, we should thank him personally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after, she seemed to have thought of something as she let out a giggle and said, “Husband, now that you mention it, Sanlang has been growing more and more ever since his wife married into our family. He’s a marquis now! Could Sanlang’s wife be a lucky star for her husband as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count Jing’an burst into laughter and reminded his wife, “Remember not to mention this out of our rooms; let’s just keep it as a joke between us. This kind of talk can’t be spread outside, or it might draw disaster upon us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that the count had returned, Countess Jing’an had found her pillar of support once again. Her mind was now clearer than before. She hurriedly replied, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two drank their tea together. When the count noticed that his wife was looking at him as if she had something she didn’t quite dare to say, he had a good guess at what she was keeping in. He sighed softly and said, “Dalang is honest and considerate to the bone. I know he’s loyal to the family. It’s not completely his fault that his marriage with Madam Zou turned out this way. The two of them have already divorced now, so don’t think too much about it. We have to take each day as it comes. As for He Ying’s child, don’t worry. As long as I’m here, I’ll never approve of their marriage. Even if Dalang were to marry again, his second wife has to be a good, kindly lady. Otherwise, Little An and Little Lin will be the ones who’ll suffer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Liu hadn’t expected her husband to have made a clear decision on the matter. It was as if a great burden had been lifted from her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She leaned against her husband’s side as the tightly wound nerves in her heart relaxed.</span></p>
