 <p><strong>Chapter 337: Getting Along in the Tent (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He Sanlang seemed to have gotten into a bad habit. Back in the cave, he had also lifted up her skirt without any warning. She was already so used to it that she was no longer surprised by his actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Wenqing and Wenlan were still in the tent. Showing off such an intimate action with an audience made Chu Lian blush a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She drew her legs back with the intention to escape, but before she could, He Changdi caught hold of her calf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't move," he murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian froze on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan exchanged glances, sharing their joy. Wenqing was the one who came up with the sensible explanation to prolong this scene. She said, "Third Young Master, Third Young Madam hasn't eaten yet. We servants will go and bring some food back."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without waiting for permission from their two masters, Wenqing tugged Wenlan behind her and escaped from the tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that their audience was gone, Chu Lian relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked down and watched as He Changdi's slender fingers rolled up her pants leg before gently removing her sock. Her slender, fair leg was now exposed to his eyes, from her calf all the way to her ankle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As He Sanlang's warm palms brushed along her calf, he revealed the wound around her ankle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rather severe-looking injury had already scabbed over. However, since the skin around it was as white as snow, the dark coloured scab was a little eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A glint flashed through He Changdi's eyes as he looked at the wound. His Adam's apple trembled a little as he touched the scab gently. "Does it still hurt?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was enjoying the warmth of his palms as they massaged her skin. Her almond-shaped eyes began to close in pleasure. She shook her head in reply to his question and said, "It stopped hurting after it scabbed over. It just gets a little itchy at night under the warm blankets."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang carefully inspected her wound for a while more. When he realised that her wound was indeed much better after it had scabbed over, he breathed a soft sigh of relief. A weight he hadn't even known he had been carrying seemed to have lifted from his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Changdi noticed that the leg he held was turning a little cool, he quickly put Chu Lian's sock and shoe back on. His palm lingered on her smooth leg for a moment more, almost as if he couldn't bear to let it go, but he finally stood up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All the care he had just shown had been carried out by his subconsciousness. He hadn't thought much of it while checking her wound, but now that he was done, the atmosphere was turning a little awkward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn't think much of the intimacy at all. She turned to continue staring at He Changdi with her wide eyes. As she blinked, she felt that He Sanlang seemed to be exceptionally handsome today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could her lunatic husband possibly have been cured?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi hadn't expected Chu Lian to stare directly at him without any reserve or shyness. His originally relaxed mood slowly turned tense once again. While his eyes still seemed like dark, icy pools, his neck and the tips of his ears were flushed red, completely out of his control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian noticed his reaction and found it fun, so she simply continued staring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were husband and wife anyway, and He Changdi was a good-looking man after all. Since she couldn't consummate their marriage, wasn't she at least allowed to admire her eye candy as much as she wanted?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi felt trapped by Chu Lian's gaze. He was beginning to feel uncomfortable, and he was even tempted to begin reprimanding her- this wicked woman shouldn’t be so unreserved about her staring! Such 'loose' behaviour was unbecoming of a noble lady.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his eyes wandered about the inside of the tent a little absentmindedly, his tense gaze abruptly caught on one little spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A familiar blue leather-bound book leaped into He Changdi’s view, causing not only his neck and ears, but even his entire face to turn red in a full-on blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Xiao Hongyu! He was going to take that brat to task!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi shared a tent with Xiao Hongyu, so he knew that that damn brat liked to read that blue leather book at night while hiding under the lamp, acting like some sneaky thief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only had to glance at it once or twice before realising what it was. It was just some lewd drawings. He Changdi wasn't interested, nor had he minded Xiao Hongyu's reading- before this, at least. Now, however, the fact that it was lying in plain sight today didn't bode well for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wicked woman Chu Lian must have discovered it. She might have even opened it! That shameless, wicked woman! She actually looked at those sorts of drawings!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surely that wicked woman didn't think that this naughty book was his?</span></p>
