 <p><strong>Chapter 475: Husband and Wife (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s strength had already been completely sapped by the activities just now, so she leaned against the screen and told Wenqing to prepare a hot bath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When that was done, Chu Lian entered the fragrant, steaming bath and let out a comfortable sigh of relief. Strength was slowly returning to her limbs. When she recalled what she had just done with He Changdi in bed, a furious blush flared back to life on her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She covered her burning cheeks with her hands and soaked in the bath in an absent-minded daze until the sound of footsteps resounded behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she turned around, she was met with the gloomy-looking He Sanlang. Her husband stripped off his sleeping robe and tossed it haphazardly to one side before stepping right into the bathtub.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t have any time to react before He Changdi was already in the bath with her. With another pull of his long arms, she was already wrapped in his naked embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes widened in shock. It took her a moment to find her voice again. “He Changdi, what are you doing! Get out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The usual cold layer of frost had returned to He Sanlang’s handsome face. He scooped up some warm water and poured it over Chu Lian’s smooth shoulders before suddenly bending over to nibble her earlobe. His deep, hoarse voice echoed through the bathroom. “What am I doing? I’m just taking a bath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian saw that his hands were starting to wander, so she started struggling. The level of water in the bath dwindled as water splashed all over the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, they weren’t able to finish their bath as half of the water in the tub had spilled over...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian let out a shrill cry as she was carried back to their bed by He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang seemed to be trying to prove himself to her as he entered her continuously, ignoring Chu Lian’s pleas for mercy. At last, he managed to last longer than their first hurried coupling...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Near the end, Chu Lian didn’t even have the strength to lift a finger any longer. The moment He Changdi had finished, she dozed right off from fatigue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was covered in beads of sweat all over, but his mood was the highest it had ever been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pulled out and went off to the bathroom to clean himself. When he was done, he found a handkerchief and dipped it in warm water to clean Chu Lian’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finished cleaning his wife and realised that red marks had been left all over her snow-white skin from his excessive use of force, guilt rose within him and he started feeling vexed with himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He helped Chu Lian into a clean set of nightclothes and gently fed her a few spoonfuls of the warm honey water on the side table. Finally, he changed the bedsheets before carefully setting her back down on the bed and snuggling in right beside her, his gaze fixed on her defenseless sleeping expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside, in the servant’s wing, Xiyan was feeling sorry for her mistress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew that Chu Lian hadn’t consummated her marriage with He Changdi on their wedding night and that this was the couple’s first time together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in the beginning when there hadn’t been much movement in the bedroom, she had still been extremely worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later on, after Wenqing had gone in to prepare a hot bath, the sounds and movements coming from inside were even louder than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could even hear her young madam’s soft cries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had never cried in front of her servants before. Xiyan was frantic with worry, afraid that Third Young Master was abusing her mistress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past when she had been bored, she had listened in on the senior servants’ gossip. The servants had talked about how there was another servant being abused by her husband, who took out the stresses of his job on her and beat her until she cried for mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more she thought about it, the more worried she got until she couldn’t take it any longer. Xiyan abruptly stood up and said, “I have to go in to check on Third Young Madam! I won’t let anyone bully Third Young Madam, even if it’s Third Young Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing was alarmed by Xiyan’s declaration. How could she actually let Xiyan enter the bedroom?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the two of them entered the bedroom at this time, their lives would likely be forfeit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She practised martial arts, so her hearing was more acute than Xiyan’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, Senior Servant Zhong had specially educated them on the birds and the bees, so she was much more knowledgeable than Xiyan on these matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t easy for her to explain it so openly. However, she understood that it was always hard for women during their first time. Although she felt for Third Young Madam as well, she was more afraid of Third Young Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were just servants, so it was better if they didn’t interfere with their masters’ activities.</span></p>
