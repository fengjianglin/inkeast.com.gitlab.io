 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Chu Lian opened her eyes, it was He Changdi who fell into her sight. In the time it took to overcome that short instant of confusion, He Sanlang had already tried placing a gentle kiss on her soft lips. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian immediately reacted by turning her head to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her temper piqued, she said, “He Changdi, you lied to me last night!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her whole body was wrapped up in the blanket within his embrace. She couldn’t move at all. At this moment, she could only move her lips. He Changdi couldn’t hold back his chuckles when he saw her flushed face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did I ever lie?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian recalled his shameless and insatiable demands from last night, she gnashed her teeth in frustration. However, she had already experienced for herself how well he could twist his words. Moreover, they were lying together on the bed right now and her whole body was still aching. She couldn’t afford to provoke him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pouted and turned her head away. She didn’t want to answer his question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang stared at her reddened earlobe for a moment. He lowered his head to suck on it, his warm breath puffing over Chu Lian’s ear as he whispered huskily, “It was my bad last night. Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The combination of his question and their intimate pose made the flush of red on Chu Lian’s ears extend to cover her entire face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pursed her lips together and remained silent. It was too embarrassing to talk about this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, He Changdi wasn’t a doctor. He wouldn’t be able to help even if she told him that it was hurting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Sanlang saw that his wife was evading his gaze with a bashful look, he could guess what her answer would have been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang was worried about her, so he suggested, “Don’t go over to visit Grandmother and Mother this morning. I’ll send someone to let them know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes widened and she immediately shook her head upon hearing his suggestion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been completely fine and healthy yesterday. If she didn’t visit her elders today for the usual morning greetings, what would everyone else think? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t want to discuss this topic with him any longer. She shifted her position and looked at the handsome man beside her. Then, she brought up her own question. “You went out to exercise this morning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spark of discomfort flashed through He Changdi’s deep eyes, but he quickly recovered his usual calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He squeezed the lovely woman in his embrace and said, “Mm, it’s an old habit I’ve had even before I went to the north. When I joined the northern border troops later, Uncle Qian was really strict, so the time I spent training became even longer.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang didn’t dare to speak the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, after consummating their marriage, he had been too excited to fall asleep last night. Instead, he had held her in his arms and spent the entire night staring at her, only managing to nap for about 3 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he had woken up, it had still been dark outside. Chu Lian had been sleeping on his chest with her rosy cheeks, fair skin, and bright red lips. Moreover, her nightclothes had gotten a little disheveled in her sleep. A man’s lust was the strongest in the morning. He Sanlang was also at the age when his body was full of vigour. With his beloved wife sleeping in his arms, it was unbearable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, afraid of hurting Chu Lian, He Sanlang pursed his lips with a grim expression and headed out to the martial arts arena to vent... Ahem… He also paid a visit to Great Doctor Miao on the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded without noticing the hidden meaning in He Changdi’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wriggled a little and complained, “He Changdi, let go of me. It’s getting late. I need to get up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Chu Lian was struggling, He Changdi suddenly bent down and whispered something into her ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian instantly froze, the healthy blush on her face instantly fading to a pale pallor. She seriously wanted to strangle He Changdi right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…..You actually went to look for Great Doctor Miao!”</span></p>
