 <p><span style>His words shocked Matriarch He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When had this brat become so sensible?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more she looked at it, the stranger it seemed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying’s eyes lit up after she heard He Erlang’s words. She glanced at her daughter with clear intentions. Unfortunately, Pan Nianzhen was still looking down in a daze and she didn’t catch the look her mother had thrown her way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying furrowed her brows slightly as she looked at her absent-minded daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He hadn’t expected He Erlang to have suddenly turned so amenable to her requests. Her mood was currently better than it had ever been for some time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She called for everyone to sit down. There were only a few of them and they were all family, so they didn’t separate the men and women for dinner. Everyone gathered around a large round table to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fermented rice wine had been specially prepared for the occasion so the women could drink freely without fear of becoming drunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were not separated by gender for dinner, their seating positions had been specially prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Dalang was sat to the left of Matriarch He, while Countess Jing’an was seated on her right. Chu Lian sat beside He Sanlang and Miss Pan was on her other side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Erlang was seated across from Pan Nianzhen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the reunion dinner tonight, Matriarch He had specifically ordered the kitchen to prepare a table full of dishes. There were also several new dishes that Chu Lian had instructed Xiyan to make in the main kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The table was laden with a magnificent feast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying looked at the exquisite dishes in front of her, before turning to smile at Chu Lian, “Sanlang’s wife, I heard about Guilin Restaurant the moment I arrived at the capital. Everyone has been saying that the dishes at Guilin Restaurant are the best in the capital. When will I get the chance to try them sometime?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Chu Lian could answer, He Ying pinched Pan Nianzhen’s hand under the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Miss Pan was shocked, she quickly reacted and continued the conversation, “Mother, what do you mean by going to Guilin Restaurant? Third Cousin-in-law’s Guilin Restaurant hasn’t been reopened yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing her daughter’s words, He Ying looked surprised and smiled sheepishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian swept a cool gaze over the two women beside her. Her expression didn’t show any hint of change and she maintained a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to He Ying and her daughter, Matriarch He was also reminded of Guilin Restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch asked, “Lian’er, what’s happened to Guilin Restaurant? Why hasn’t it reopened yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was only He Ying and her daughter asking about it, Chu Lian could simply smile and ignore them. However, now that the matriarch had personally spoken up, she couldn’t continue pretending ignorance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian replied in a serious manner, “Grandmother, I was planning to make some changes to the layout of Guilin Restaurant at first, so I told Xiyan to close the restaurant before the new year. The servants probably didn’t dare to do anything else without my approval, since I wasn’t in the capital. Thus, the reopening has been delayed until now. Now that I’m back in the capital, I’ll work on reopening the restaurant as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He dropped her line of questioning and nodded. She advised, “It’s best if you can reopen it earlier. The old Duke of House Zheng has already sent his servants over several times to ask about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, she knew that it was actually the matriarch who was pushing her to reopen the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Old Duke Zheng really couldn’t wait to eat those delicacies again, he wouldn’t have sent people over to ask the matriarch. He would have come to look for her himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s thick brows wrinkled slightly as he listened to his grandmother’s words from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch gave the order to start eating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was a rare reunion, they disregarded the usual formalities and the whole family chatted while eating.</span></p>
