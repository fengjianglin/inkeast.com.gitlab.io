 <p><strong>Chapter 431: The Horrible He Sanlang (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s fingers were nimble, and she quickly but carefully took off the bandages covering He Sanlang’s leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at the wound on his knee first and found that the wound had already scabbed over. The surrounding skin was also clean and dry, so there was nothing wrong with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian frowned and traced the wound upwards. She started checking on the injuries on He Sanlang’s inner thigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since He Sanlang couldn’t move his leg right now, Chu Lian had no choice but to move into another position and climb onto the bed. She kneeled on the inner side of the bed while bending over to take a good look at the wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi hadn’t thought much of her inspection at first, but her unintentional pose made his thoughts run wild. His gaze flitted downwards, only to see her fair little face near a very important part of his body...</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already fallen for Chu Lian and desperately wanted to be closer to her physically, so it was even harder to restrain his reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian hadn’t noticed her lunatic husband’s response at all. She finished inspecting that wound on his right thigh and found that it was actually healing pretty well and that there was no problem with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The realisation that he had been lying, coupled with how he had tried to stop her earlier, hit her like a ton of bricks. She instantly puffed up with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to her fury, her face flushed red and even her almond-shaped eyes were lit up with the fire of her rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian harrumphed. She looked up, about to vent her temper on He Changdi, when her gaze accidentally fell upon a part of his body that was a little abnormal right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What could a thin pair of shorts hide?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excited Little Brother He stood out clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes widened in disbelief as all of the blood in her body rushed to her cheeks. Her blush even extended all the way down to her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took Chu Lian a dazed two seconds before she quickly moved away. Following that, her limpid eyes glared accusingly in He Sanlang’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gaped as she tried to recover her wits. Finally, she spat out, “He Changdi, you pervert!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the whole of the Great Wu Dynasty, He Sanlang was likely the only one who had ever been branded a pervert by his own wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was also both ashamed and frustrated at his own reaction. The roots of his ears were also completely red. However, he still managed to keep his aloof expression on his face as he stared at Chu Lian’s lobster-red face in a daze. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, he tried to explain in a raspy voice, “I didn’t do it on purpose, I couldn’t hold it back…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s response was to shoot a fierce glare at him. The meaning behind it was clear: could you be any more shameless?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s heart was thumping rapidly in her chest. Even though she had lived in the modern era for over twenty years, she had never experienced anything like this before. Her face was so red that it felt like it was on fire. She wanted to escape from this awkward situation as fast as she could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian scrambled off the bed in a panic, intending to pull on her shoes and run away. However, the more panicked she was, the clumsier she became. As she was getting off the bed, she accidentally tripped over her own skirt and almost tumbled right off the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, He Sanlang had been watching her the whole time and was able to catch her at the right moment. With a tug of his strong arms, Chu Lian landed in his embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had already gone through the whole spectrum of emotions by now. The fright from the near-fall shocked her into a dazed state. Bewilderment filled her eyes, softening her usual sharp wit and adding an extra trace of cuteness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Urged on by that lovely sight, He Changdi’s pupils dilated before he bent over to capture those rosy red lips. The soft, slightly cool feeling of her lips against his sent a wave of enjoyment crashing through his whole body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since they had shared their first kiss in the tent, the memory of it would pop into his mind from time to time. Every time he reminisced about it, He Changdi would get even more love drunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian hadn’t expected this sudden attack from He Sanlang at all. Her almond-shaped eyes widened as far as they could go and she struggled in his grasp. Her muffled grunts didn’t do anything to move him and she didn’t have any strength to push him away. She wanted to try kicking instead, but when she remembered that his leg was still heavily injured, she stuck to using only her hands to push against his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Lian’s weak arms were like ants trying to push down a tree. Once He Changdi had tasted enough of the sweetness of her lips, he gently pushed past her teeth to brush against her tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang had become even more familiar with this after the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The all-consuming kisses made Chu Lian short of breath. Although the force of her arms against his chest slowly weakened, He Changdi wasn’t willing to let her off so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hands he had placed on her back started wandering and caressing her. Although she was dressed in layers of clothing due to the cold weather, he was still able to hold on to her slender waist easily. With a slight tug, she was now flush against his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only when Chu Lian’s face had flushed completely red again that He Sanlang finally let her go. Even then, he wasn’t willing to part with her. He showered kisses lovingly on her fluttering eyelids, the bridge of her nose, the fine corners of her lips, and her dainty little chin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had almost fainted from the lack of air during their kiss. Her mind was a complete blank while her body felt like a wet noodle. All she could do was gasp for air right now, so she didn’t have the spare energy to mind the light kisses that he was dropping on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it didn’t take long for her to recover. When she finally realised that there was something hard jabbing her in the waist, Chu Lian’s soul instantly returned to her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right as He Changdi’s trail of kisses had reached Chu Lian’s slender neck, she shot out a hand to cover his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He Sanlang, why are you so horrible!”</span></p>
