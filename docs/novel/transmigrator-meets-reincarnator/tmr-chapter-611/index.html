 <p><strong>Chapter 611: Thousand Blessings Festival (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had his hands on his knees as he rubbed the green jade ring on his thumb. Chu Lian was also wearing a smaller-sized ring like his on her left hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian noticed He Changdi’s gaze directed at her, her smile brightened even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang raised his brows a little. In a charming voice, he said, “What are you smiling at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian tilted her head. He Sanlang had an originally frosty disposition, but his experience as part of the northern army had given him a trace of a military man’s air. His face was incomparably suave; he had well-defined features, a tall nose, and a pair of dark eyes which were incredibly captivating. He was like a frigid iceberg in the midst of a raging storm, and anyone who accidentally wandered into his reach would never be able to break away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Learning from him, Chu Lian raised her eyebrows as well and said, “He Changdi, I don’t notice it normally, but you’re pretty handsome now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had refined facial features, and his skin was fairer than most men. His figure looked like it was sculpted by the gods. He had truly received the best traits of both Countess Jing’an and Count Jing’an. She hadn’t felt much about it at all when she was reading the novel, but now that she could see him with her own eyes and he had become her husband, she was overwhelmed by the difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite his thick skin, there was no way He Changdi could stay stoic against his wife’s unbridled praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t show it on his face, his ears reddened a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they spent their days together, Chu Lian had already become more aware of the minute changes in his expression, so she snickered inwardly. Actually, He Changdi was still very innocent in some ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi didn’t speak a word and pursed his lips. From a bystander’s point of view, it was like his face had become even grimer, perhaps bordering on enraged, but that wasn’t actually what happened. He was just shy and embarrassed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was incredibly entertained. She wanted to tease him more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two sat facing each other with half an arm’s distance between them. He Sanlang could reach Chu Lian just by straightening his long legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She leaned forward slightly and blinked her wide almond eyes at him. “He Changdi! Your ears are red!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she said that, she moved back like a child who had just received a treat and began to laugh while covering her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A twitch developed on He Changdi’s forehead. Taking advantage of the fact that Chu Lian had her guard down, he reached forward and caught her, pulling her over to his side and making her sit beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still in the middle of laughing, Chu Lian was startled by his sudden overbearing action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she had the chance to relax, her small mouth was sealed by a pair of ice-cold lips and her mouth was plundered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes widened. She subconsciously resisted by pushing away the strong man with both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, her feeble arms didn’t have enough strength to make any difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Changdi was satisfied with the taste of her sweet mouth, he let go of her. Her cheeks were like now as red as apples as she leaned against He Changdi’s chest, panting heavily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With watery eyes, she glared at him in protest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi leaned down so that his mouth was by her ear. With a deep voice, he whispered, “You look really good right now, too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes widened in mingled shock and bashfulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he say that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been sincere while praising his appearance, yet he had only complimented her after their kiss?! Was he trying to say that she only looked good when she was out of breath?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just wanted to tease him a little and wasn’t expecting to be assailed in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian brandished her claws and struggled in his embrace, but He Changdi seized hold of her with a grim face, fiercely admonishing, “Stop moving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his face actually turn grim made Chu Lian even more depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to retort, but before she could, she came into contact with something hard under his robes, causing her to freeze up entirely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was now the very picture of an obedient puppy. She was rather speechless, all she had done was struggle a little, and He Sanlang had such a huge reaction… Was this a good or bad thing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi pulled her closer into his embrace. He restrained his emotions and suppressed his growing impulses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he looked down at the woman in his arms. He Changdi really wanted to straighten her out right this minute, but this regrettably wasn’t the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some time later, He Changdi suddenly whispered something into her ear, which made her eyes widen again as she looked at him in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s expression didn’t change at all. He acted as if he was earnestly discussing an important scientific question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong? Senior Servant Zhong said that it will be easier to get pregnant by doing that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was incredibly tempted to roll her eyes at him. There wasn’t any correlation between the posture they used and the chances of getting pregnant. Besides, her period had just ended, so this was her safe period. The possibility of her getting pregnant was miniscule at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way,” she said. Her face began to redden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who knew what He Sanlang was thinking right now? His mind seemed set as he continued to insist. “How would you know if you don’t give it a try?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple were in the midst of discussing physical limitations in the carriage when the mounted Laiyue reminded them from outside, “Third Young Master, Third Young Madam, we’re about to arrive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, the carriage slowed down, then came to a complete stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue spoke up again. “Third Young Master, Third Young Madam, you’ll have to get off the carriage here. The path onwards has been blocked by the other carriages.”</span></p>
