 <p><strong>Chapter 680: Muxiang Enters the Estate (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian quickly came back with a small, exquisite mahogany box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sat down by He Changdi’s side and pushed the box to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There, that’s for you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s voice was low and magnetic as he asked with a little smile, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian passed him the tiny silver key that she kept on her at all times, “Won’t you know once you open it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Expectation built up in He Changdi’s heart unconsciously. He took the silver key and made quick work of the lock. With a clack, the box sprung open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a contract and a square personal seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although He Changdi didn’t interfere with Chu Lian’s businesses and he never investigated her properties, he still knew a little about what his wife did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His servants were still right by her side after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A personal seal from Tonghui?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tonghui Bank was a bank opened by one of the rich Shandong nobility. Although it wasn’t as big as the government-controlled Longhui Bank, it was a private bank so there were all sorts of powers backing it. It was a mix of crooks and honest folk. Those who didn’t want to reveal their identity would use Tonghui Bank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tonghui Bank would issue a type of personal seal specially for important clients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as they brought the stamp to a branch of Tonghui Bank, they would immediately be able to draw cash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were very few of these seals in circulation; less than a hundred according to rumours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tonghui Bank was older than the Great Wu Dynasty, so it could be imagined how valuable a personal seal from Tonghui Bank was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also a direct reflection of how profitable Chu Lian’s northern market was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded without any change in expression, “It’s mine. I’m giving it to you to use. Aren’t you lacking in funds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s gaze fell upon his beautiful wife. He sighed and stroked her smooth cheek, “My silly Lian’er, don’t you know what this seal represents? And you’re giving it to me just like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian puffed up her cheeks and rolled her eyes, “What else could it represent? It’s just money… What can I do with all that money anyway? You’ll put it to better use. Our Great Wu is large but lacking in material goods, so it’s easy to earn money. Anyway, it’s not like there’s a limit to how much I can earn. &nbsp;I’m not a dragon that needs to hoard gold either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian thought differently from most noble ladies because she was a modern person at heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most noble madams would simply store and save up their money once they earned it and feel content looking at the mountain of gold at home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What they didn’t know was that money had to be spent in order to generate wealth. The amount of money that Chu Lian had was just a number anyway, using it where needed and getting things done was more important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had only opened up the market in the north on a lark, for the citizens of Liangzhou and giving the poor barbarian people another source of income. Based on some luck and some power, she had somehow made the business bigger than she had imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the business grew too big, it might attract unwanted attention, so Chu Lian was actually satisfied with what it was now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as she had enough money to spend and her days were spent carefree, that was enough for her. Having a huge amount of silver wouldn’t bring her any joy and would instead bring a lot of worries. Why not just throw it all to He Changdi and let him settle it for her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s heart warmed because of her gesture. He had encountered so much unjustness in his past life. Even his own parents had never done anything so thoughtful for him before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, he felt that all the pain and suffering he had gone through in his past life had been for the sake of earning the love of this woman in his arms now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian noticed that his eyes had gone unfocused and that his lips were pressed together as he remained silent, she frowned and waved one fist in front of him. She acted tough as she mock threatened, “What? You don’t want it? Are you afraid I’ll charge interest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi focused his gaze on her lovely features. The stiffness in his expression faded and softened as if the spring breeze had pushed it away. He hugged Chu Lian tightly as his magnetic voice resounded by her ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lian’er, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian rested her head against He Changdi’s chest. There was a slight smile on her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple stayed ensconced in their little corner of warmth for an hour, unknowing of the growing impatience in Muxiang’s heart as she waited in the parlour outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she had followed Wenlan over to her new room, she had been taken to the parlour next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The handmaids and senior servants who were usually close to Chu Lian were all here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan looked at her sister, who was right next to her, but Wenqing shook her head. Just as she was about to speak, Senior Servant Zhong called the two sisters over to the corridor outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the two handmaids could speak, Senior Servant Zhong ordered, “The two of you, take Muxiang with you on your work. She is to take the place of Jingyan temporarily. When you have the time, tell her about Madam’s usual habits and the rules of our estate. Do guide her along.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan were surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing thought it over before asking, “</span><i><span style>Momo</span></i><span style>, is this Madam’s order? Although Sister Muxiang is Matriarch He’s handmaid and we won’t mistreat her, isn’t it a little inappropriate to let her take the position of personal handmaid so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong had her own doubts in her heart, but this wasn’t her decision to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This order came from Master and Madam. Since our masters have already decided, we are to follow their orders. However, we cannot be complacent and forget to take caution against her. The masters had this meaning too when they ordered you to guide Muxiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan exchanged glances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They then replied in unison, “</span><i><span style>Momo</span></i><span style>, don’t worry. We understand.”</span></p>
