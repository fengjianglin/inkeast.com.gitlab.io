 <p><strong>Chapter 664: Suspicion (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang hugged his lovely wife in his embrace. His warm palm unconsciously traveled back to Chu Lian’s abdomen. As if afraid that his touch would harm the fragile life growing within, he didn’t dare to rest his palm fully on her abdomen and instead, simply stroked the sides softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t feel that anything was wrong with He Changdi’s actions or the importance he was placing on their unborn child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just him after all; even she treasured their child very much. That little unformed bean was going to be their legacy on this earth. There was nothing cuter than creating a new life, what’s more a life that they had created together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thought came to Chu Lian suddenly, and she wriggled around in He Changdi’s embrace to ask, “What were you discussing with Uncle Miao just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi looked down at her without any visible emotions in his expression, although he appeared slightly stiff. “Uncle Miao passed down some things to take note of during the pregnancy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was a little touched by this gesture. Normally, most doctors or physicians wouldn’t know much about taking care of a pregnant woman unless they specialised in gynecology. However, Great Doctor Miao was the exception, and he had even specially passed down that knowledge to He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once my pregnancy is stable, let’s prepare a gift for Uncle Miao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi nodded seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Chu Lian didn’t know was that Uncle Miao had only called He Changdi out to warn him repeatedly not to sleep with Chu Lian in the first trimester of her pregnancy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had also warned He Changdi to control himself. The rest of the information about pregnancy had only been told to him as an aside...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple rested on the chaise together for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was the one to softly speak up first. “He Changdi, why didn’t you tell me about those things earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi stiffened. The arm he had placed under Chu Lian’s neck moved to help her tuck in some stray strands of hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know about it all?” He Changdi’s voice was reminiscent of the tolling of an ancient set of bells, able to make one immersed in its sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was rather unhappy as she said, “It was Sister Hui who specially came to tell me about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That loose-mouthed woman...</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi remained silent without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only when Chu Lian used her elbow to jab at his sturdy chest that He Sanlang reluctantly spoke up. “Lian’er, I didn’t want you to worry for me. It was Prince Jin and I who miscalculated this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian suddenly fought out of his embrace and sat up. She turned around to glare at him with disbelief. “You… The two of you really developed your own silver mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed like a fluffed up kitten hissing angrily at an opponent, not at all threatening and very cute. He Sanlang couldn’t resist pinching one of her soft, smooth cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A corner of his mouth curled up, giving him a devilish flair that made Chu Lian’s heart skip a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know about everything already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gulped audibly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She slapped his chest and said, “What the hell were you thinking?! How could you dare to do such a thing?! You’re lucky His Majesty didn’t blame you for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi harrumphed inwardly. Even if they didn’t do it, there would have been someone else who did!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Xiao Bojian who had used that private silver mine to get to where he did in his previous lifetime!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silver mine was in the north, not too far from the mountain where Chu Lian had fallen. It was the Tuhun spies who first found it. Although he had known of this vaguely in his past, he hadn’t had the details of its location, nor had he known that this had something to do with the Tuhuns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t until this lifetime that he had gone to investigate further and gotten all the details. That was when he had found out that the Tuhuns wanted to steal the silver mine for themselves!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian had likely been in cahoots with the Tuhuns even in his past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also due to the Tuhun interference that he and Prince Jin hadn’t suffered any consequences on the surface even after this matter had been reported to the emperor. To the rest of the world, they had cleared out all the Tuhun spies and secured the silver mine for their empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a different matter altogether in private. The emperor’s opinion of them had likely sunk to rock bottom! How could the emperor not lay blame on them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just from the spring hunt alone, they could see that the emperor had purposely suppressed Prince Jin from shining too much and had intentionally shown favour to Sixth Prince instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sixth Prince was only fifteen this year, yet the emperor had actually given him permission to join in court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those with discerning eyes could tell that the crown prince had been locked up and was only an empty shell. The ones who had the ability to fight for the throne were Fourth Prince and Sixth Prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back when they had discovered the silver mine, the only ones with them had been their trusted subordinates. They had even placed a group of loyal assassins sworn to the death to guard it. Going by common sense, the existence of the silver mine should have never leaked out. How had this news somehow made it up to the emperor?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been investigating along with Fourth Prince’s men these few days, but none of the subordinates seemed suspicious. Since He Changdi had known of the silver mine thanks to his previous memories, then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could there be someone else who was the same as him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s pupils dilated as a dangerous light shone from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each suspicious incident seemed to be connected by an invisible line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meeting Xiao Bojian in Suzhou, Chu Lian getting kidnapped, the messy things that had happened when they had returned to the Jing’an Estate, Chu Lian almost getting trapped at Miss Yuan’s coming-of-age… There had been so many strange events that had never happened in his previous life. Adding on to that the secret of the silver mine leaking...</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could it be possible? Unless… there was really someone else who had experienced the same lifetime he had!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi suppressed his turbulent emotions and took in a deep breath, shoving all his terrifying guesses to the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s done is done, we can’t cry over spilled milk.” He Sanlang’s voice was cold and calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sighed. That was true. Things had already come to this point. She didn’t think that He Changdi and Prince Jin developing a mine on their own was that major of a crime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they hadn’t done it, someone else would have. If the silver mine had landed in the hands of someone sinister, then the situation might be even more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a selfish world. While there weren’t any obvious factions in the war for the throne, since He Changdi was close to Prince Jin, if Prince Jin wanted to vie for the throne, he had no choice but to be dragged into Prince Jin’s faction.</span></p>
