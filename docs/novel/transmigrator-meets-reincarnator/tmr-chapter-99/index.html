 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 99: Restaurant (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were getting along well when Senior Servant Liu came in with a smile, reporting that Eldest Young Madam had brought the two young ladies over with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked at the account book before looking up at Matriarch He again, her eyes shining with expectation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He smiled. "You silly child. Alright, I'll inform your sister-in-law myself when she comes in."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting the matriarch's reassurance, Chu Lian stopped worrying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn't tell what Madam Zou would think about this, since the novel hadn't mentioned much of her personality. However, she was Wei Fengzi's close friend after all, and Wei Fengzi was someone to watch out for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the novel, Madam Zou had gotten seriously injured from 'Chu Lian's' ploy early on. She couldn't even get out of bed. However, now Madam Zou was perfectly healthy and managing the entire estate. They were wives of different branches of the family and their interests weren't in conflict.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But no matter what kind of personality Madam Zou had, Chu Lian didn't want Matriarch He's gift to give rise to any resentment between them and affect the peace they had now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her husband wasn't by her side to shelter her, and she didn't want to create an enemy for herself within the estate. That would just make her days harder for herself! </span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, when Madam Zou entered Qingxi Hall and heard that Chu Lian had already been there for some time, her eyebrows knitted together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She brought her daughters into the parlour with a smooth expression. When Madam Zou performed her greetings, Chu Lian stood up and returned it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, Matriarch He started to explain how Chu Lian would be taking over the management of Guilin Restaurant. The slight tension in Madam Zou's heart went away upon hearing the matriarch explaining everything to her so clearly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew a little about the private properties that the matriarch held.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most profitable one was a sencha shop. Its monthly earnings were roughly two to three hundred taels. The worst property was Guilin Restaurant. It had been a losing business for years. Madam Zou still couldn't understand why Matriarch He kept it with her even though it wasn't earning money at all. She could have sold it off to buy another store in a more bustling location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just a restaurant in the red, and Matriarch He had explained it to her straightaway, so Madam Zou didn't mind that only Chu Lian was given a property. Her impression of Chu Lian also improved by a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dalang's wife, you've managed the estate for so many years and you've done well in managing the businesses in your hands. When you're free, do give a few pointers to Sanlang's wife."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou gave a genuine smile this time. "If Third Sister-in-Law doesn't mind, then come to my courtyard at any time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then I'll have to thank Eldest Sister-in-Law in advance!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He's heart was soothed as she watched her granddaughters-in-law interacting peacefully. Her gaze fell upon her great-granddaughters and she opened her arms wide. "Little An, Little Lin, come over to Great-Grandmother's side and let Great-Grandmother have a look at you two."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He tenderly stroked their heads. However, seeing them, she did have some regrets. Little An was already six, but there were no great-grandsons for her to pamper yet. As she thought so, her eyes turned to Chu Lian's flat belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since her arrival to the Great Wu Dynasty, Chu Lian had become rather sensitive towards other people's gazes and the meanings hidden inside them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she noticed the matriarch eyeing her belly, she stiffened and her mood worsened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had forgotten that she had submitted that blood-stained white handkerchief to Matriarch He's servants. In Matriarch He's eyes, she and He Sanlang had already consummated their marriage on their wedding night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the Chu Family's misses had the reputation of being particularly fertile. Perhaps Matriarch He thought that she had 'hit the bullseye with one shot'.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's mouth twitched in her embarrassment. She was still a virgin, so it was impossible for her to be pregnant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be scarier if she actually got pregnant in this condition!</span></p>

 <p><strong>TL Note:</strong> If you like Chu Lian's funny and silly inner thoughts, try reading&nbsp;<a href="http://volarenovels.com/this-mc-is-kickass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This MC is Kickass</a>! The female lead is literally named Nutjob and the story starts out with her accidentally making the ugliest game character in history...
