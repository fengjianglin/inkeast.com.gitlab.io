 <p><strong>Chapter 326: Rumours (5)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What General Sima normally drinks?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The quality of Zhengshan tea was only slightly lower than that of the imperial tribute teas. The amount of Zhengshan tea produced was even less than that of the North Fujian loose-leaf tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every year, before it was time for the spring harvest of tea, the nobles would fill up all the reservations for Zhengshan tea cakes. It wasn't something that could be bought with money alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, Miss Yuan had tried to use some Zhengshan tea stolen from her grandfather to provoke Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked at the adjutant and almost burst out laughing. Were General Sima's thoughts the same as this adjutant's, or was it just this female adjutant who was stupid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had thought about declining the tea outright, but instead, she chose a more subtle route and hoped the female adjutant would get the message. Honestly, this kind of ploy was just too clumsy and silly. She had also seen it done before by Miss Yuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before Chu Lian could speak, Wenlan could no longer hold back her desire to protect her master. "Excuse me, Madam. You might not know this, but our master doesn't like to drink sencha because it tastes weird."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting such a reply, the female adjutant's face flushed red and her lips started trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned to look at Wenlan disapprovingly. Wenlan stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female adjutant's disrespect had been written all over her face. Chu Lian didn't intend on admonishing her own maidservants in front of strangers. She turned back around, keeping her face warm and friendly as she kept her silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After some time, the female adjutant finally got over the dissatisfaction in her heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She took in a deep breath and forced a smile. "It was this subordinate's fault for not checking about Honoured Lady Chu's likes in advance."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian replied with a courteous, "It's fine."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The adjutant Xiaoyan wanted to continue saying something else, but before she could, a soldier announced from outside the tent that Great General Qian had sent an escort for Honoured Lady Jinyi, and they were to head to the commander's tent immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stood up and led her party out of the warm tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan sent them off at the entrance. As she stared at Chu Lian's disappearing back, the smile on her face finally faded away and her long face contorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The handmaid next to her complained in a low voice, "Hmph, that Honoured Lady Jinyi can't even tell good from bad. She even dislikes sencha! This servant thinks that she probably hasn’t ever had sencha before and just doesn't dare to admit it!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan's lips curved up in a mocking smile. That was probably the case!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was just a poor noble from a declining house. How could she possibly compare to their female general?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female adjutant Xiaoyan hadn't lied on one point. Sima Hui did drink sencha often. Her favourite was Zhengshan tea. Although she wasn't part of the main branch of the Sima Family, she had Old General Sima's connections. While the current Sima Family had become rather short of male heirs, they still lived in luxury and had much better lives than most of the second-rate noble families in the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, the handmaid Xiaoyan, who had been raised like an adopted daughter, wouldn't have become so arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan sneered. "Make sure you follow the orders I gave you last night."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, Sister Xiaoyan. This servant will go and make the preparations now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>General Qian personally escorted Chu Lian out of the commander's tent. With the war at hand, he didn't have much time to accompany Tang Yan and Chu Lian's party. He had taken time to meet them personally out of respect for the Empress Dowager's decree and the supplies they had brought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the relationship between Captain Guo and He Changdi, once Chu Lian left the commander's tent, General Qian handed them over to Captain Guo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already past 1pm by now. Since it was Chu Lian's first time in the army camp and He Sanlang wasn't around, Captain Guo took the initiative to invite Chu Lian, Tang Yan, and the rest to stay for lunch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Captain Guo smiled and said, "Sister-in-Law, although the meals in our camp are just some simple fare, it might be an interesting experience for you, just once in your life."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn't reject him. Since she had already come over to the border camp, she wanted to take a good look around; a chance like this didn't come along every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Yan's thoughts were along the same line as Chu Lian's. However, the only difference was that he was a man, so it was much more convenient for him to move around in the army camp. In recent years, he had been working for Prince Jin so he hadn't left the capital in quite a few years. He wanted to take this chance to observe how things were structured in the army, as well as their daily training and other general affairs. </span></p>
