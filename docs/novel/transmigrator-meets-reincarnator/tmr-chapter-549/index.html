 <p><strong>Chapter 549: Drama (4)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the saying went, good deeds didn’t go very far, while bad deeds could spread a thousand miles. Before the coming-of-age banquet in House Ying had even ended, the news had already spread to the ears of every noble madam present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the noble madams who had good relations with House Zheng softly commented, “It’s no wonder that Marchioness Anyuan left in such a hurry. If my maiden family was like this, I’d sever all ties with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Precisely! With a stepmother and sister like that, Marchioness Anyuan certainly led a hard life,” another madam added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the news spreading like this, most of the guests had already left before the banquet even ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Yuan watched as the guests who had come to congratulate her left the Ying Estate in droves. Her polite facade was on the verge of breaking as her entire being shook with fury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stood to one corner with a deathly pale and malevolent expression, staring at the screen behind House Ying’s main gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her handmaid, Xiaoqin, quickly went to Miss Yuan’s side. “Eighth Miss, the matriarch has summoned you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Yuan held back the rage that was about to explode from within her and turned to leave in the direction of Old Duchess Ying’s residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since all of the guests had already left, there were no outsiders around in the Old Duchess’ courtyard. Second Master Chu Qizheng and his wife were kneeling before the old duke and duchess, who were seated above them with thunderous faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Yuan had never experienced anything like this before, so she walked into the parlour in a shocked daze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she even had the chance to speak a word, Old Duke Ying had already ordered her to kneel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You utterly useless fools!” the old duke cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Yuan had never received such a merciless scolding from her grandfather before. Her eyes immediately reddened and her tears began to fall. However, since both of her parents were keeping their heads down, she didn’t dare to open her mouth recklessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old duke had already ruthlessly reprimanded his son before Chu Yuan had arrived, so he was already tired of speaking. An encompassing silence fell over the parlour as it became so quiet that it seemed like time had stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the long bout of silence, Old Duke Ying declared, “I have decided to pair Miss Su off to Wujing, so the two of you can settle Miss Yuan’s marriage on your own!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sentence made the kneeling family of three raise their heads in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That won’t do! Father, didn’t you agree to let Miss Yuan marry Xiao Bojian?” Second Madam quickly implored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without giving Second Master the chance to speak, the Old Duke harshly shot her down. “My mind is set! You can go back and reflect on your mistakes over the next few days!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Duke Ying got up and left the parlour without further ado. He didn’t respond no matter how much the second branch begged. The old duchess glared at them as well before leaving with the help of her handmaids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not a single ounce of strength was left in Miss Yuan. Her limbs turned weak and she immediately collapsed to the floor. Her eyes became unresponsive and empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Sanlang left the estate on horseback, he learned that Chu Lian had already made it out of the Ying Estate in one piece.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only at this point that his heart finally settled back down. He turned back for one final stare at House Ying’s main entrance, a grim, icy look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi whipped his horse and headed straight back to the Jing’an Estate. His entire visit to the Ying Estate was completed without even taking a single bite of the banquet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only fifteen minutes had passed since Chu Lian returned to Songtao Court before He Changdi returned as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he entered Songtao Court, his first reaction was to ask, “Where’s Third Young Madam?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui shivered from the chilly aura he was emanating. Out of reflex, she replied, “Third Young Madam is changing her clothes in the bedroom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang impatiently strode to the inner room. When he walked up to the screen in front of the bathroom, he spotted Xiyan standing by the entrance and caught the sounds of running water with his sharp ears. He waved at Xiyan to dismiss her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan threw one glance at the bathroom before obediently leaving with her head lowered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang paused for a second. After taking a deep breath, he moved past the screen and entered the bathroom.</span></p>
