 <p><strong>Chapter 348: Green Jade Thumb Ring (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hongyu immediately ducked behind Zhang Mai after hearing such a sinister sound from He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wooden chair by the side table was taken up by Captain Guo. The tent was furnished very simply and there weren't any extra chairs around, so He Changdi could only stand to one side once he joined the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Captain Guo smiled and gave a meaningful look at the fleece blanket embroidered with flowers, which clearly didn't belong to a man, laid out on He Changdi's bed. He then patted the neatly folded bedding on the side table and shook his head. "Previously, I was worried about Zixiang's health, having to sleep on such a cold bed all the time, so I requested for a new set of bedding from the great general. It looks like it's not needed anymore."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying so, he tossed the bedding to Xiao Hongyu. "How lucky for you, brat!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hongyu chuckled but he didn't accept the bedding. He turned and pushed it into Zhang Mai's arms. "Brother Zhang has some old injuries, we can't let him suffer the cold. I'm still young, so the fleece blanket that Brother He gave me will be enough for me to pass this winter."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun didn't shine much out here in the north, and temperatures were extremely low. Although Captain Guo and Zhang Mai were only in their thirties and they looked healthy and strong in their armour, the many years of army life had already left unseen marks on their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it was cloudy, rainy, or cold, especially in this winter season, their old injuries would flare up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The court hadn't been able to send supplies to them, so they were severely lacking in not only food, but warm cotton-padded blankets and clothes to survive the winter. Great General Qian had not only personally met Chu Lian out of respect for the Empress Dowager, but also because the supplies that Chu Lian had brought over were just what they needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even now, many of the foot soldiers didn't have cotton-padded blankets or clothes. Most of them were using dried grass to make do. This was also why Captain Guo had to go to Great General Qian personally just to request for a set of bedding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this were any other camp, they might still be able to ask the citizens nearby to donate some supplies. However, there weren't many people in the north they could ask for supplies from. Liangzhou was practically a shell of a city, with only their troops left to defend it. Thus, the situation was looking quite bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the bedding that Captain Guo had brought over ended up with Zhang Mai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Captain Guo shot a glance at the package that He Changdi was carrying and smiled. "Seeing how lovey-dovey you and your wife are is making me miss my own. I wonder how she and the kids are doing in the capital."</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the land and water routes had been blocked by the snow. Letters hadn't been able to pass through for quite some time. Even officers like Captain Guo and the rest hadn't been able to receive anything from home since a month or two ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Captain Guo's words made the originally lively atmosphere in the tent dim down to a dead silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang's thoughts were also drawn out. He thought of his grandmother back in the capital, as well as his sickly bedridden mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Captain Guo realised that the air didn't seem right and tried to lighten the atmosphere again. "Alright, alright. What are you all thinking about? Our fifty thousand brothers-in-arms here in the north all share the same fate now. If all our brothers start becoming as gloomy as you guys, then how are we going to fight off the Tuhuns?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hongyu rolled his eyes and muttered under his breath, "And who was the one who mentioned that topic in the first place..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Xiao Hongyu! I see that you're just bent on looking for trouble! Hmph, don’t make me unleash my temper on you!" Captain Guo stood up and acted as if he was going to give Xiao Hongyu two black eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After playing around for a bit, the sad atmosphere from before completely dissipated.</span></p>
