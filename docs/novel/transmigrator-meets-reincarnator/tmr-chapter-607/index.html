 <p><strong>Chapter 607: Without a Cheat (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After an hour, He Changdi got up and headed to the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He summoned Chu Lian’s handmaids, Senior Servant Gui, and Senior Servant Zhong for questioning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even Xiyan didn’t know what Chu Lian was worrying about. She only knew that Chu Lian had been rather anxious these few days, but she had no clue what the root of it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment He Changdi had stepped out of the bedroom, the seemingly asleep Chu Lian opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She blinked and looked up at the canopy above her, head in a daze. There was fear muddling her clear gaze. Yesterday had marked the end of the knowledge she had about the events of the Great Wu Dynasty…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had only read the book halfway, so she had no idea what was in store for her in the later half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the same as a sniper entering a foreign land and losing their map and knowledge. The situation affected her mood, making her lose all sense of safety and letting her fears and insecurities take over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sucked in a deep breath. The lost look in her eyes slowly changed into one of determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She believed that she would be able to live just as well even without her cheat guiding her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After letting go of the worries that had been burdening her, Chu Lian’s mood became more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back over the past year, even though she had known about the events about to happen, He Changdi had always acted out of her expectations. Not everything had gone according to the book’s original plan, either, and she hadn’t been able to avoid the major events of the story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, she had spent the past few days torturing herself for nothing with all these thoughts and pointless worries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After reflecting on it, she realised that having foreknowledge of the future didn’t make any difference anyway. It was good enough as long as she remained true to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that she had finally thought things through, she recalled how forward she had been with He Changdi. Her face instantly flushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She called out for a servant, and Wenqing entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s my husband?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing carefully looked over Third Young Madam and found that her complexion was a rosy pink and that her almond-shaped eyes were curved into crescents. The handmaid understood that her master’s mood had improved vastly. Her worry for her master vanished. When Third Young Master had seen how unhappy Third Young Madam had been, he looked like he was going to punish all the servants of Songtao Court!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Replying to Third Young Madam, Third Young Master is in the study. Would you like to go there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian thought for a moment and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing helped her into a silver and red five-layer full length gown and specially picked out some matching pearl accessories for her hair, giving Chu Lian a clean and elegant appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was in the middle of some deep thinking with his eyes shut. He subconsciously rubbed the jade ring on his thumb as he did so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard the sound of the door being opened, his eyes slowly fluttered open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To his surprise, Chu Lian entered the room. The smile on her face was like the sun, casting away the gloominess hanging over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi beckoned Chu Lian over, and she quickly walked up to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come here by yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren’t any open documents in front of He Sanlang. The inkwell next to him was also dry, so it was clear that he wasn’t in the middle of sorting out some official business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a gentle tug of his arm, He Changdi pulled Chu Lian onto his lap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian made a token struggle before giving in to his wishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was tall and long-limbed, whereas Chu Lian was much smaller in size. Sitting obediently in his lap, she looked like a cute little ‘daughter’ instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang wound a loose lock of her hair around his finger as he spoke to her in a low, magnetic voice. “What should we prepare as a gift for the Thousand Blessings Festival?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had been focused on her own thoughts over the past two days, so she hadn’t given much thought to it. Now He Changdi’s question reminded her that the emperor’s birthday was approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the emperor’s fiftieth birthday this year, and even the empress dowager had ordered for a grand celebration to be held.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ranked noble ladies would have to enter the palace for the banquet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just He Changdi who had to prepare a gift; she had to prepare something in her capacity as Honoured Lady Jinyi as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian saw that he was contemplating with a frown on his face, so she asked, “Do you have something in mind already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi put an arm around Chu Lian’s slender waist, the corner of his mouth tilting upwards. “How about the Snow Mountain Mists flower?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chengping Emperor ruled over the vast lands of the Great Wu. He didn’t need money in the least, so their gifts had to be something more than just valuable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He and his wife weren’t close to the emperor at all and weren’t certain of his likes and dislikes. Thus, they could only pick some interesting treasures as gifts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was still a single flower left after using the rest of the Snow Mountain Mists flowers for Countess Jing’an’s medicine. From what Great Doctor Miao had said, the Snow Mountain Mists flowers were more precious than hundred-year-old ginseng or </span><i><span style>lingzhi</span></i><span style> mushrooms. While they weren’t so powerful as to be a cure-all, they were invaluable as the main ingredients to cure many deep-seated illnesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This information had been passed down from Great Doctor Miao’s teacher. Even the imperial physicians in the palace had no idea about the medicinal uses of the Snow Mountains Mists flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a unique medicinal ingredient would be more than enough as a birthday gift for the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pondered it for a bit before nodding. “Luckily we had one stalk left. This gift is much better than presenting some other treasure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the couple decided on their gift for the emperor’s birthday feast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that she was in higher spirits, He Changdi decided to tease her a little. “Lian’er, have you decided on what you’re going to give the emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian showed him a cunning smile. “It’s much simpler for me. I’ll just cook a dish for him and bring it into the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang poked the tip of her nose in response. He suddenly turned serious and said, “Once the Thousand Blessings Festival is over, we’ll move out of this estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian abruptly sat up. Her eyes were wide in disbelief. “Really? You’ve already discussed it with Father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi nodded. </span></p>
