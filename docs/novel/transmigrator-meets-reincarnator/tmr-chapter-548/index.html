 <p><strong>Chapter 548: Drama (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment He Changdi left, Xiao Bojian quickly entered the room without a care, completely ignoring the stares of the crowd. Even One couldn’t stop him in time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One helplessly shook his head. Afraid that the situation would take a turn for the worse, he decided to take up the spot Laiyue was in earlier and guard the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Yuan wanted to go in as well after seeing Xiao Bojian head inside. Fortunately, Second Madam still had the presence of mind to pull her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian had an ugly grimace on as he pushed away the curtains and entered the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Master Chu Qizheng was standing by the bed with a blank expression, shocked beyond words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian took in the contents of the room with one glance, but all he could see from this angle were the figures of two people lying together in bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a moment of panic, he actually pushed Chu Qizheng aside and lifted up the curtains around the bed. The sight of two strangers entered his view一 no, that wasn’t right; the naked woman was someone he knew. She was one of the subordinates he had sent to execute the plan…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the unconscious man, Xiao Bojian had a slight inkling as to who he was. He looked like a distant relative of Eighth Miss, Chu Yuan. Xiao Bojian had seen him once before by sheer coincidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tension in Xiao Bojian’s heart disappeared in an instant. He subconsciously wiped away the cold sweat that had gathered on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What a relief... Lian’er was unharmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the burden in his heart released, Xiao Bojian immediately returned to his usual calm and gloomy self.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a grim look on his face as he turned to look at Chu Qizheng. He sent him a cold sneer as he said, “It seems like Sir Chu isn’t worthy of trust when it comes to business. Our deal is off. All the best to you, </span><i><span style>Sir</span></i><span style> Chu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, it was obvious that Xiao Bojian was now aware that he had been fooled by the second branch of House Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng hadn’t thought that Xiao Bojian would figure things out so quickly, so he hastily explained, “Mister Xiao, I’m also unsure why things happened this way! Perhaps it was those two skilled handmaids around Chu Lian who turned the tables. This has absolutely nothing to do with me. You’ve already agreed to marrying Miss Yuan. How can you go back on your word!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian’s patience had been thoroughly depleted. He let out a cold snort as he walked past Chu Qizheng, not even deigning to give him a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng was shocked by the lack of reaction from Xiao Bojian. It took him a few seconds to recover and scold with a low, raspy shout, “Xiao Bojian, don’t forget who your teacher is!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, it didn’t matter how angry Chu Qizheng got. Xiao Bojian quickly vanished from his field of vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng staggered a few steps forward as all the energy left his body. Luckily, he managed to grab onto an old wooden rack, or he would have fallen to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng took some time to put up a calm front before leaving the room. The first thing he did was walk up to Second Madam in a fury and begin to berate her. “All you do is cause trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then turned to Miss Yuan. “Why haven’t you returned to your damned room?! You’re getting more and more outrageous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even someone as slow as Miss Yuan could tell that something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her father had only revealed these plans to her after discussing them with her mother, so why would her father chastise her at a time like this? There was only one possible reason for that: the plan had failed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng quickly left the scene, furiously charging out of the courtyard with his attendants. Second Madam and Miss Yuan went into the room in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They looked all over, but they couldn’t find any trace of Chu Lian, even down to her dirty clothes! Chu Yuan stared blankly in shock. There was a terrible expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This whole affair turned out to be a dramatic play where they had ended up shooting themselves in the foot, so the gossipy expressions of the ladies who had tagged along with Chu Yuan faded into awkward silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The news of Miss Yuan falsely accusing her own sister of adultery at her own coming-of-age ceremony would likely spread everywhere soon enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When that happened, there probably wouldn’t be a soul left who would speak up for her, let alone take her side.</span></p>
