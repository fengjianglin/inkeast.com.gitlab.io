 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 335: Scram (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, when He Changdi finally led his troops back into camp, a messenger came over to report that Chu Lian was currently in his tent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi shot a severe glare at Xiao Hongyu. Xiao Hongyu rubbed his nose awkwardly from behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He decided to run off with the other troops to have their midday meal and leave He Changdi and Chu Lian alone in the tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Changdi reached his tent, he noticed three female soldiers squatting in front, washing clothes. He Changdi furrowed his brows together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He barked, "What are all of you doing here?!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>His gaze landed on the wash basin and he realised that the garments inside were his clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan and the others hadn't expected He Changdi to have returned so early. Their faces were full of surprise. However, Xiaoyan was experienced with dealing with unexpected situations after serving Sima Hui for so long, and she managed to quickly recover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan acted as if she had been wronged and placed her hands, which had turned an ugly purplish red from the cold, on top of the wet clothes in the basin to make them more obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She intentionally made her voice soft and weak to draw their pity. "Captain He, we escorted Honoured Lady here. Our general ordered us to serve Honoured Lady, so we had to follow Honoured Lady's orders when she told us to wash these clothes. Although this subordinate was born a lowly servant, this subordinate is still General Sima's personal handmaid."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan was right. Chu Lian had indeed been the one to order Wenlan to bring these clothes out for them to wash. However, she had purposely phrased her words to imply that it was an unfair order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xiaoyan spoke, she kept sneaking glances at He Changdi's expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, she couldn't discern any bit of emotion from He Changdi's cool and handsome face, so she couldn't tell if her ploy was working.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She gritted her teeth and continued. "This subordinate ventures to say that Honoured Lady has taken things too far. Our general has never held any dishonest intentions, yet Honoured Lady has already tried to nip things in the bud. This subordinate has never seen such a thing!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan kept her back straight and her head high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was even a little pleased inside. With this, Captain He should know how unbearable his wife was!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nothing had even happened yet, and Sima Hui wasn't even a threat to their marriage. However, his wife had already tried to discipline Sima Hui's personal handmaid. He Changdi would surely hate such a petty and jealous wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan had heard everything from within the tent. Their faces were flushed red with anger. Wenlan wanted to run right out of the tent to scold Xiaoyan, but Chu Lian held her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shook her head soundlessly. Wenlan stomped her foot in frustration and walked further away from the tent entrance. Out of sight, out of mind. If she couldn't hear any of the conversation outside, her frustration would surely dissipate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Lian stood by the tent flap without moving. There wasn't much of an expression on her face, but her clenched fists hidden by her wide sleeves betrayed her nervousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was a tall man. Even though Xiaoyan wasn't short, he could still look down upon her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He swept the three female soldiers with an icy glare. Next, his lips moved and his low, magnetic voice resounded in a frighteningly cold tone. He only had one word to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Scram!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>That short syllable was enough to make Xiaoyan and the others shudder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes widened in disbelief. They couldn't believe He Changdi could act like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A storm seemed to be brewing in the dark pools that served as He Sanlang's eyes. He focused his gaze on Xiaoyan, who struggled to breathe when faced with eyes as icy as those. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Didn't you hear me? I told you all to scram!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if a basin of cold water had been dunked over the three female soldiers' heads. Their bodies started trembling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They ran off helter-skelter after a moment's pause, even stumbling in their efforts to leave as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier standing on guard nearby was filled to the brim with admiration for his captain. He stood up even straighter, looking just like a sharp spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang's gaze turned to the wooden basin by his feet next. When he thought of how his clothes had been handled by those female soldiers, his brows drew together in disdain. He then ordered, "Throw out all the clothes in this basin."</span></p>
