 <p><strong>Chapter 223:&nbsp;Keeping Her Behind (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Old Duchess Zheng saw that her husband had finally woken up, she couldn’t restrain herself any longer and began to cry. Tears slid down her cheeks as she exclaimed, "My Duke, you've finally recovered your appetite!" And without waiting for the servants to move, she rushed over to the old duke's side and personally helped him sit up against the headboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was clever enough to quickly recover from her instance of surprise. She moved over the table in front of Old Duke Zheng to make room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Duke Zheng had been bedridden for quite a period of time. The struggle just now seemed to have used up all his remaining strength. He couldn't even lift his hand up, and could only stare right at that plate of stuffed orange with crab meat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Duchess Zheng quickly took up one of the oranges and personally fed it to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the soup entered his mouth, Old Duke Zheng's eyes shone even brighter. His heart moved, his eyes lit up, his nose flared and his mouth smacked with the sound of his enjoyment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After swallowing a mouthful of heaven, Old Duke Zheng had completely tossed his idea of fasting to the back of his head. If not for Old Duchess Zheng holding him back and not letting him eat too much at once, he would have probably gulped down an entire stuffed orange in two or three bites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Old Duke Zheng had woken up and had already broken his fast, it wasn't appropriate if strangers continued loitering inside the inner room. Leaving Old Duchess Zheng inside, the younger Duchess Zheng invited the guests, including the imperial physician, to the outer room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Duchess Zheng invited Matriarch He to take a seat, she curtseyed to Chu Lian in gratitude. "This was all thanks to Honoured Lady Jinyi's efforts today. Please, accept this bow from me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian quickly helped the younger Duchess Zheng up. "Madam, please don't stand on ceremony with me. It was just a small matter."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duchess Zheng shook her head. "Honoured Lady Jinyi, you don't have to be so humble. Even the imperial cooks couldn't have made such an amazing dish. Honoured Lady really has some marvellous ideas. It's awe-inspiring to me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The back of Chu Lian's ears felt a little hot. How were these 'marvellous ideas'? She was merely a gourmet who had collected knowledge from the centuries of cooks before her... Duchess Zheng had really evaluated her too highly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Matriarch He saw her granddaughter-in-law looking so embarrassed, she chuckled. "Sanlang's wife, have you made more of those stuffed oranges? If there's more, bring some up for us to taste as well. My appetite’s been awakened after your small introduction just now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded. "I have!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian retrieved a larger box of food from Mingyan's hands. The servants had sent over quite a number of oranges to the kitchen, and it hadn’t taken much to prepare them. Thus, Chu Lian had made a few more portions, thinking to let everyone have a taste of something new. With Matriarch He’s prompting, it was just the right time to bring out the extra portions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each person was given one orange; even the imperial physician who had come to check on Old Duke Zheng had one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people present here weren't as picky as Old Duke Zheng. Thus, the impact of the gourmet food was even stronger on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The imperial physician held on to the empty orange, feeling unsatisfied. He stared at the empty shell in his hands, finally having a shred of sympathy for Old Duke Zheng's predicament. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After tasting something so carefully prepared and so delicious, having to return to normal fare was like going from heaven to hell. It was extremely painful. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Duke Zheng had just woken up, so no matter how tasty the food was, Old Duchess Zheng didn't dare to give him much of it. She could only try her best to persuade him to pace himself, and finally managed to convince the old duke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After finishing his meal, Old Duke Zheng had used up all the energy he had. He closed his eyes and returned to bed. The imperial physician took this chance to enter the inner room again and check the old duke's pulse. When he came out, Old Duchess Zheng anxiously asked about the old duke's health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The physician smiled and reported that the duke would be fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Old Duke Zheng had a healthy body and sharp mind, despite his age. He was just a little more picky about his food. He was only bedridden because he had decided to fast- now that he was willing to eat, and since Chu Lian had prepared such a nourishing meal, his body would recover just fine, given some time. In the days ahead, he just had to drink some nourishing decoctions and return to eating normally.</span></p>
