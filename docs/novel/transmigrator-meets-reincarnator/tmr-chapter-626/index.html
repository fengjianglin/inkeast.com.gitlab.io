 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day, Chu Lian was naturally unable to get up at her usual time. However, He Changdi got up early to attend morning court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crown prince had been grounded. The emperor had even sent officials from the supreme court to investigate the incident regarding the fake phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During morning court, He Changdi was simply standing amongst all the officials, but he had a strange feeling that there was a sharp gaze looking down on him from time to time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the Chengping Emperor would possess such an oppressive gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Chengping Emperor had a good impression of He Changdi, he usually didn’t pay all that much attention to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sense of caution immediately emerged within He Sanlang’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor unexpectedly ordered He Changdi to stay after the court was adjourned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Sanlang came out of Qinzheng Hall, he was holding an official document within his hand. It was an official document that he and his father, Count Jing’an, had presented to the emperor to request permission to leave House Jing’an and establish his own noble estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the usual procedures, if things went smoothly, then it would have taken at least half a month to obtain the approval. However, all the procedures had somehow been completed within a few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the Chengping Emperor had personally handed the official document to him. It inevitably caused He Changdi to think deeper into this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the emperor had even rewarded him with a plot of land within the capital to use as the Anyuan Estate…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Real estate was very expensive within the capital. Even for noble families who had lived in the capital for several generations, it would be difficult for them to purchase properties here. Originally, He Changdi and Chu Lian had already decided on the estate that they were going to move into. Although it wasn’t considered a luxurious manor, the estate had four courtyards, which was enough for the young couple to live in. If they chose an estate that was too big, then it would feel rather empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi took a look at the property that the emperor had bestowed upon them. It was a five-courtyard estate that was located in a good area of the capital. The mansion had originally been the residence of a prince during the era of the first emperor… Later on, the mansion had become vacant after that prince had left for his own assigned lands out of the capital. Following the changing of generations, the prince had eventually passed away. However, the estate had remained vacant ever since.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many high-ranking officials and noblemen had had their eyes set on this estate for a long time, but the Chengping Emperor owned the property. Thus, no one had dared to take the initiative to obtain that mansion. However, it had so easily fallen into He Changdi’s hands now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even He Changdi was perplexed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi immediately reported this matter to Chu Lian when he returned to the estate. Chu Lian also thought that there was something weird about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they didn’t understand why the Emperor was suddenly being so considerate to He Changdi, they had obtained a good residence for themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a holiday the next day, so He Sanlang and Chu Lian headed over to to Kangping Lane to take a look at the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the emperor had personally approved the official documents and specially gifted them with a new estate, Chu Lian and He Changdi completed their move out of the Jing’an Estate a month later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He found out only on the day they were moving. She almost fainted after finding out. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muxiang, who was standing behind Matriarch He, was also in disbelief that He Changdi was really moving out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, she had been able to get a clear understanding of the situation within Songtao Court since she worked close by as the matriarch’s handmaid. Now that He Changdi and Chu Lian were moving out of the estate, she wouldn’t even have the chance to get close to He Changdi anymore!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muxiang was completely stunned. Senior Servant Liu noticed her soulless expression, which made Senior Servant Liu even more cautious of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the entire Jing’an Estate, only Matriarch He and Muxiang were against He Changdi moving out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an had more of He Changdi’s interests at heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If He Changdi hadn’t been bestowed the title of marquis, then he should have continued living in the Jing’an Estate. However, her son had become a marquis now. Even if they were able to live together, the position of Count Jing’an would be passed down to Dalang in the future and her youngest son would still have to move out later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dalang would definitely get married again by then. It would be troublesome if there was an uneven distribution between the two branches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the capable young couple of the third branch had the ability to survive on their own. It would also be more comfortable for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count and Countess Jing’an had also noticed that the matriarch was dissatisfied with Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch had reflected on her behavior after Chu Lian had honestly reprimanded her at Qingxi Hall back then, but there was still a gap between the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once enmity sprung up between two people, it would be difficult to clear up misunderstandings and revert back to their previous relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was also Marchioness Anyuan, so she would definitely have to take up the mantle of lady-in-charge of her own household in the future. It was better to let the young couple gain some experience outside while they were still young. If they made any mistakes at this point, Countess Jing’an still had the ability to help them out right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Count Jing’an had the same opinion as his wife. However, his perspective was not only limited to He Changdi. Once He Changjue finally settled down, he would also allow his second son to move out with his wife.</span></p>
