 <p><strong>Chapter 632: Stinky Tofu (4)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had only brought Wenqing and Wenlan this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were riding in the carriage with all of their clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Chu Lian and He Changdi had arrived at the camp, they had only just arrived mere minutes earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of their stewards steered the carriage and parked it next to their tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian ordered Wenqing and Wenlan about as they unpacked the things they had brought with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The steward and two guards were helping to unload the luggage off the carriage. As they saw what their marchioness had packed, the old steward couldn’t help the twitch that developed in the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just look at all this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A specially made metal wok, a strange metal rack with unknown purpose, all sorts of ingredients that a hunting ground would lack, seasonings he had never heard of, jerky, fruits, desserts…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the luggage they had brought in that one carriage, half of it was food… As for the other half, they were all things to cook food…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In comparison, look at what the noble madam over there had brought: clothes, accessories, incense, all sorts of furnishings...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old steward bowed his head in shame, resigned to his fate. He continued helping his noble madam move all sorts of food-related items into the tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the foodies staring at Chu Lian and He Changdi’s tent didn’t share the same thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they had even started preparing the meal, there was already a table full of guests in Chu Lian’s tent…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sima Hui and Royal Princess Duanjia were to be expected, since they were both ladies. However, what was with Great General Qian and Old Duke Zheng inviting themselves in? What were these two old beardies doing here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Captain Guo, Xiao Hongyu, and Zhang Mai didn’t have any space to sit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they would rather stand than leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Liu, tell your servants to cook a little less, just enough for our table to eat. Ignore those gluttons standing over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hongyu hadn’t eaten breakfast in the rush to leave this the morning. As a young man, he couldn’t bear with the hunger and was starving by now. Royal Princess Duanjia’s words only made him feel even more stubborn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, due to the princess’ status, he couldn’t respond to her provocation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry looking at the tent full of guests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the nobles settling into the hunting grounds, they had brought their servants to cook their meals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor’s meals were taken care of by his attendants, but for the three soldiers, they had to take care of their own meals. It was only if the emperor specially ordered a feast to be held that they would be able to gather for dinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the number of guests, the maidservants they had brought wouldn’t be enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight that first greeted He Changdi when he entered their tent was their table full of guests. His expression immediately turned overcast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t say anything with Old Duke Zheng and Great General Qian around, since their statuses were greater than his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked at the ingredients that the steward had brought and wondered what to cook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, the steward had packed extra food just in case, otherwise there might not have been enough to feed this group of gluttons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since there were so many people present, Chu Lian told Wenqing to grill some lamb chops and prepare a large pot of sour beef stew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sour beef stew contained a lot of mushrooms and vegetables. It was very appetising when paired with white rice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the best dish for a large party like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were in the wilderness, they could prepare simple dishes without being too fussy about the presentation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Wenqing and Wenlan worked on the lamb chops and sour beef stew, Chu Lian continued looking through the ingredients they had brought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted the cloth covering a small bamboo basket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw what was inside the basket, Chu Lian’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stinky tofu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was what she had made a few days ago with the maidservants when she was bored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it couldn’t be stored for long, the cook managing Songtao Court’s kitchen had packed it in when the steward had told her to prepare ingredients for the trip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian loved to eat fried stinky tofu the most back in the modern era, especially Changsha’s special stinky tofu. The stinky tofu would be perfectly crisp once prepared properly. In order to make it Changsha style, she just had to spread a layer of bright red chilli paste on the outside. If you bit into it, it would be crispy and fragrant, with the perfect crunchiness on the outside and soft tofu on the inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While it still stunk to high heaven, it was addictive once you got past the smell and took the first bite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stinky tofu was a pretty marvelous food when you thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stared at the pieces of stinky tofu in the little bamboo basket and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she didn’t use them up today, it would likely spoil. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasting food was criminal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weather was slowly warming up again. Fresh foods would spoil faster now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, she hadn’t eaten stinky tofu in a long time and she had been craving for it for so long. She checked the time and realised that there was still enough time before the spring hunt to cook the stinky tofu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a slight moment of hesitation, Chu Lian made her decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She took up the little basket and moved over to the stove where Wenqing and Wenlan were preparing food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan was in the middle of seasoning the lamb chops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that her master had come over, Wenlan quickly set down the things in her hands and welcomed her, taking the little basket from her master’s delicate hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She even said, “Third Young Madam, please rest and leave all the work to us servants.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian couldn’t resist bursting out into laughter. “You and Wenlan won’t be able to do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan refused to admit defeat. She and her sister had been serving Third Young Madam for so long, and Third Young Madam had never been stingy with sharing her cooking techniques with her handmaids. How hard could making a few dishes for their guests be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan blinked and looked at the basket that she was now holding. “Third Young Madam, what’s in here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian noticed her curiosity. A mischievous glint passed through her eyes. “If you want to know, why don’t you open it up?”</span></p>
