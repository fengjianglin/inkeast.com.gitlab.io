 <p><strong>Chapter 568: Count Jing'an is Returning (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps due to her ‘overnourishment’, Chu Lian was especially energetic this night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple kept at it all through the night. Even the experienced Senior Servant Zhong, who was on duty in the side room, couldn’t help blushing over the noises she heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day, Chu Lian slept in until the sun was high in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned to one side without thinking and was suddenly re-acquainted with all the sore parts of her body, especially her waist...</span></p>
 <p><span style>When her eyes flickered open and her mind started to wake, the scenes from last night played in her head one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s face turned bright red. She pulled the warm blankets to herself and beat the bed with her fists. Regret washed over her in waves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could He Changdi do that! He had actually hid the truth from her! No wonder she had felt that something was strange with her body these past few days. She even thought that He Sanlang had become a herbivore, but he was actually a wolf in sheep's clothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking of the nourishing tonic she had readily drunk over the past few days, Chu Lian felt that she was a lamb being fattened for slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crazy passion they had shared last night made Chu Lian wish she could spontaneously erase all her memories. Where did He Changdi learn all those shameful poses…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pulled the covers over her face and hid like an ostrich with its head in the sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the sounds of footsteps outside the bedchamber made her get up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She took in a deep breath and rubbed at her warm cheeks. When she felt calm again, she asked, “What time is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan was standing by the bed. When she heard the question, she immediately replied, “Third Young Madam, it’s almost the eleventh hour of the morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stiffened up. She threw back the blankets and leapt up in a single instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the sudden noise, Wenlan quickly added, “Third Young Madam, please don’t worry. Third Young Master has already informed the matriarch and the countess before he left this morning. You don’t have to greet them today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian blinked and let out her anxiety in a single breath. Although her relations with the matriarch had already soured, she still had to do what was required as a junior member of the family. If she was lacking in etiquette, it would reflect badly on her instead. Luckily, He Changdi had already taken care of that for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Young Master went to the Ministry of War and said he would return in the afternoon. Would you like to get up now, Third Young Madam?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian lifted the bed curtains and told Wenlan to bring her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she finished washing up and sat at the table for breakfast, she seemed to have the strange feeling that the servants were looking at her with knowing expressions, coupled with teasing glints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t sit still. It felt like she had done something wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she was done with breakfast, Countess Jing’an even specially came over to Songtao Court to visit her with a bowl of soup...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The obvious intentions of her mother-in-law gave Chu Lian the urge to pummel He Changdi to get rid of all the embarrassment welling up within her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she was still happy to see that Countess Jing’an had become well enough to visit her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, do you feel any discomfort in your body now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since her health had improved, her mood had never been better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Countess Jing’an had filled out a little. Her cheeks were now rosy with the pink of health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The countess shook her head with a smile. “Not at all. I’m perfectly healthy. I can eat well and sleep well. I never dared to dream of recovering my body to this state before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an had spent many years bedridden. Even though the root of her illness had been cured, she was still a little more fragile than most. She would have to be careful not to expend too much energy in the future. However, compared to her condition a few months ago, this was a vast improvement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was already very content with what she had now. Before this, she had been expecting to spend the rest of her life confined to a bed.</span></p>
