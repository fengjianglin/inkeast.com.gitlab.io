 <p><strong>Chapter 556: Mutton Soup (7)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indignation rose in Eldest Madam’s heart. It was bad enough that Chu Lian hadn’t made a peep after Guilin Restaurant’s reopening had failed so spectacularly. However, she still had the mood to cook up more delicious food at home!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t that being too much?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the time it took for these thoughts to pass through her mind, He Ying had already entered Songtao Court with her daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A maidservant immediately ran in to report their arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time they reached the parlour, Chu Lian and He Changdi were already drinking mutton soup and eating flower rolls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The savoury vegetable flower rolls and the pot of thick, warming mutton soup, as well as the various plates of appetisers, presented a huge feast for the eyes. He Ying and her daughter had started salivating without realising it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian and He Sanlang had already been informed that He Ying and her daughter had come, so they weren’t surprised in the least.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian set down the white porcelain bowl in her hands, Xiyan immediately stepped forward with a wet towel for her to wipe her hands. Following that, Chu Lian slowly stood up and bobbed towards Eldest Madam in greeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What might be the reason for this visit, Aunt?” Chu Lian’s smile was as charming and brilliant as ever. Her tone was also friendly and her voice pleasant to the ear. The way she kept a faint smile on her lips as she spoke was as refreshing as the newly arrived spring breeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when faced with this sight, only anger and irritation abounded in He Ying’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She harrumphed coldly and said, “What? I can’t just pay a visit to you without a proper reason now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang looked up from his soup and cast a deliberately cold glance at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That one look was enough to send chills down Eldest Madam’s spine. However, she quickly recovered her calm and propped herself up with the facade of a senior family member. She sat right down on a sandalwood chair without waiting for an invite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen sat obediently behind her mother like a harmless little pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean, Aunt? Of course you’re welcome to visit us anytime you like.” Chu Lian’s mood didn’t seem to be affected by He Ying’s words at all. Conversely, she seemed rather agreeable and amenable. She took her seat again right after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While He Sanlang was seemingly drinking his soup without a care off to the side, he had been watching Chu Lian the whole time. Seeing that her appetite wasn’t very good and as a result, she hadn’t eaten much, he filled up her bowl of soup again and set it before her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drink more,” He Changdi said. His magnetic voice was especially seductive when he lowered his volume to a husky whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Pan Nianzhen’s first time hearing such a gentle tone from her cousin. Her face instantly turned red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She replayed the scene again in her mind, but placed herself in Chu Lian’s position instead. While listening to He Changdi’s voice, she drifted off into daydreams...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian wanted to reject the bowl of soup. She had already eaten a whole Shandong steamed bun earlier, and she had topped that off with half a bowl of soup and a single flower roll. This was already more than enough for her tiny stomach, so she tried to push the bowl away. Unfortunately, He Changdi was much more stubborn than she was, especially with the effect of his threatening glare sent her way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian still felt rather hot, so she hadn’t wanted to drink too much mutton soup. It wasn’t good to disobey He Sanlang at this time though.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If his strange temper really flared up, he wouldn’t care if it were right in front of outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pouted and started sipping slowly at the fresh mutton soup, still acting like an unwilling child. She even fished out the mutton and lamb organs she didn’t like and threw them into He Sanlang’s bowl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although He Changdi’s expression hadn’t changed and he looked as unfriendly as ever, he didn’t seem to mind eating all of the rejected food that his wife had thrown into his bowl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This unintentional display of unconditional love and pampering from He Sanlang made Pan Nianzhen mad with jealousy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to push Chu Lian away and sit in her place to accept all of He Changdi’s care and concern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Eldest Madam stared at the loving couple seated across from her, stunned by their lack of reaction and about to explode from sheer frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t thought that Chu Lian would just continue on eating after saying a couple half-hearted replies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hey! They weren’t invisible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying’s face was flushed red from her mounting anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, that soup they were drinking was just too fragrant. She didn’t know what it was, but it had successfully hooked her appetite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As stubborn and proud as Eldest Madam and Miss Pan were, they couldn’t control the unconscious reaction of saliva pooling in their mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially when they watched He Changdi eating so heartily. They were starting to get hungrier and hungrier...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to the failing mess of Guilin Restaurant, Eldest Madam had barely been able to summon up any appetite at all over the past two days. She and her daughter had only eaten a few bites for their lunch today, too, so it was about time to eat again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the ultimate torture to be faced with delicious food on an empty stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying and Pan Nianzhen were facing that exact torment now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps even her stomach was especially agreeing to the sentiment, as a loud grumble sounded from Eldest Madam’s belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan, who was on standby in the parlour, almost burst out into laughter, but she managed to get it under control after her sister glared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying’s eyes gleamed with clear dissatisfaction. She had already made it so obvious, yet these people were acting as if they hadn’t noticed anything at all. They just refused to bring up the tantalising, steaming hot dishes on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had a huge appetite. Furthermore, since these dishes had all been cooked by Chu Lian herself, he couldn’t help eating a few more bowls than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Eldest Madam saw that He Sanlang had just taken another serving of soup from the claypot in front of him, she finally spoke up, unable to resist the great temptation presented by the food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, what a coincidence, I didn’t think that you would be having your lunch at this time. What is this soup? It smells delicious. I’ve never tried something like this before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying stared right at the claypot in a very obvious hint.</span></p>
