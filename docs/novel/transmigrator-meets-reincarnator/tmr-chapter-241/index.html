 <p><strong>Chapter 241: Becoming Famous (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The poor Manager Qin was about to be universally condemned by these people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Manager Qin still stood up straight on the stage with his hands behind his back. He even carried a faint smile on his face, as if their scoldings couldn't even shake him one bit. He quietly waited for the crowd to release their emotions for a moment before he said, "As the saying goes, if you don't have glue, don't try to fix a broken bowl. You won't know what I can do until you see for yourself. If you don't believe me, why not come up and have a taste? My master and I will be satisfied, no matter your judgement, if you try it at the very least."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh ho, that young manager was putting out wild boasts again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fine, I'll make sure this conceited man returns in defeat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spectators below hadn't thought that Manager Qin would challenge them to judge like this. As they clamoured to go up for a taste, they were filled with both ire and determination: no matter what, they would make sure this lousy Guilin Restaurant would have no choice but to admit defeat! They wanted to make this restaurant that hadn't even officially opened yet turn into the joke of the capital. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Qin shot a look at the server behind him. The server brought out six strong men, who then moved a pile of crude porcelain dishes to the sides of the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next, the crowd watched as big fat jars as tall as their calves were moved to the center of the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the three crudely made jars, someone below started laughing. "Hey, Mr Manager, your master can't possibly be treating us to whatever 'delicacy' is in those jars, right? Let me guess, it's pickled vegetables in there, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my, so Guilin Restaurant's specialty is pickled vegetables! They must be as old as Guilin Restaurant itself!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Qin wasn't bothered by the taunts from the crowd below. He simply looked at the three jars and waved his hand at the server. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The three servers standing behind the jars lifted their hands and took off the leather lids from the jars all at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The autumn wind blew past from behind the stage, causing the fragrant aroma to drift all around the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The noses of the people closest to the stage twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is that smell? Why does it smell so good?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I smelled it too! Heavens, what is that?!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steam rose up from inside the three crude jars, shrouding the stage in mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, someone pointed at the sight and said, "The smell is coming from those jars!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that person pointed it out, quite a few people started moving closer to the stage, causing the crowd to thicken. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's really coming from the jars. What is it!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>When someone finally asked the question, Manager Qin's smile slowly widened. He patiently explained to the watching crowd, "This is my master's secret recipe of braised pork in a pot. It's one of our Guilin Restaurant's specialties. We used top-quality pork belly and cooked it in our own secret way. All of you here have good luck! This is the first time this dish is making an appearance in this world. If you want to taste it, you'll have to be quick!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meat! Heavens! So it was actually meat inside!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time they had seen someone using jars to cook. Furthermore, this delicious aroma was so rich and appetising. Was it really just pork in there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could that base pork smell so heavenly? Impossible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the current age, very few of the nobles would use pork in their cooking. Most of the meat they ate was comprised of venison or mutton. Pork was meant for the poor commoners who couldn't afford to buy mutton.</span></p>
