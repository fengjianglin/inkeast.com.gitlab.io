 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 215: Lies (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As He Changqi looked at his friends holding their full bellies leaning back against their seats, burping with satisfaction, the corners of his mouth couldn't help but twitch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily he had noticed that the situation was turning a little strange, so he had sent all the servants out of the room. Otherwise, if they had let their servants witness that battle just now, their servants would have surely thought that the whole group of gentlemen had been switched out for some imposters- and not just any imposters, but the hungriest of the hungry from the capital’s most starving beggars!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he looked again at the empty plates and dishes on the table that had practically been licked clean, He Changqi couldn't even be bothered to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the hungry ghosts before him had rested for a while, Heir Zheng slammed his palm on the table unhappily. "Brother He, you're too selfish! We've always invited you to join us for meals and drinks! The food here is so delicious, how could you wait until today to invite us to your estate for a meal?" </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Ge shot a sideways glance at He Changqi, whose expression was turning dark. When he thought back to Madam Zou's actions just now, he realised that the situation was a little delicate. He Changqi had also been wolfing down food like he hadn't eaten in days. This was probably his first time eating such amazing cuisine, too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Ge didn't blame He Changqi like Heir Zheng did. He simply leaned back against his chair without any consideration for his image as he sipped at some old duck soup to satisfy his remaining cravings. Somewhat sourly, he said, "He Sanlang's quite the lucky one. He deserves to go all the way to that terrible northern border! I pitied that brat at first, but now, I've lost all pity for him. If he were right here in front of me now, I'd tell him, 'you deserve it'!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that the sweet and sour pork ribs were all gone, Marquis Weiyuan and Lord Ge were the best of buds again. "Poor He Sanlang the Fair!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>After eating his fill, Xiao Bojian kept a low profile. His eyes were half-shut and his long lashes hid the pools of emotion in his eyes. He pinched his left index finger with his right thumb and index finger. Thanks to the spiciness of the fish from earlier, his thin lips were flushed red. No one could see the dissatisfaction and resentment in his eyes. He remained as still as a statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Heir Zheng wasn't familiar with his personality, he might have asked his senior brother about his mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian's eyes swept over He Changqi, a hidden glint in their depths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of this should have been his!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian'er personally cooking for him, praising Lian'er's skills in front of his friends, Lian'er helping him to manage the household... Facing each day as a couple, exchanging sweet nothings, supporting each other through the trials of life...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after the group had just finished an unforgettable meal, a manservant entered the room with a wine gourd in hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manservant looked at the now-empty dishes on the table with shock. He blinked a few times in disbelief before coming to his senses. He quickly walked over to He Changqi's side and lowered his voice to ask, "Eldest Young Master, do... do you still want to serve this wine?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manservant had gone to fetch the ten year old </span><i><span style>Yudongchun</span></i><span style> wine which Marquis Weiyuan had specially brought over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Who could have thought that the food would be completely decimated before the wine had even reached the table?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heir Zheng looked around the group of gentlemen and said, "Just serve the wine!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marquis Weiyuan and Lord Ge nodded. They had already filled their bellies, so the wine wouldn't hurt them. Since they had had such a great meal, they were starting to get an itch for a drink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changqi nodded and ordered the manservant to call in two maidservants to clear out the empty dishes. He then had the main kitchen send out some food to pair with the wine, so that they could all drink their fill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After tasting those amazing delicacies, no one had an appetite for any of the normal dishes. They even felt a little depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The men had the feeling that their days were going to get rough from now on... As the saying goes, it's easy for the frugal to become extravagant, but it's hard to reverse the process. After having such delectable gourmet food, it was going to be hard to swallow down their usual fare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With those thoughts in mind, all of them drank more than usual to drown out those depressing thoughts. The ten year </span><i><span style>Yudongchun</span></i><span style> was considered one of the strongest spirits in the capital and packed a punch. Furthemore, the men couldn't bring themselves to eat any of the food that the main kitchen had sent over, so they ended up drinking even more than usual. </span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, everyone was a drunk, incoherent mess- even He Changqi, who usually had a great tolerance for alcohol, was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the manservant saw the state the men were in, he could only order some servants to bring them to their rooms for a good rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seemingly woozy Xiao Bojian was brought to a private room by an average-looking manservant. Once they were alone, his originally misty eyes abruptly awakened. His gaze was sober and calm, completely lacking any sign of his earlier drunkenness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The average-looking manservant, who was One in disguise, bowed to his master. "Master, you're not drunk?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian made a vague sound in reply before rubbing his temples. "Follow me to the inner court of the Jing'an Estate. Leave Nineteen here to guard this place."</span></p>
