 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only He Sanlang and Chu Lian were left in the tent. Wenqing and Wenlan had already made their escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this had been a normal day, Chu Lian would have definitely been more stubborn and hardheaded. However, she just couldn't summon up her courage today. She snuck a glance at the missing space in front of the armour and made a silent prayer for herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her body had just been warmed up by the soup, but now her lunatic husband had gone and made things all cold again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she looked at how He Sanlang was sitting up straight at the side without moving, as if he were a statue, Chu Lian felt extremely awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long moment of silence, Chu Lian lost her patience first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was my mistake today. I'll compensate you with another set of armour."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi looked straight at his wife, who had her head slightly lowered. All the anger in him had already disappeared when their guests had left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing how she had shrunk back into herself like a scared little bunny, the reprimand that he had been about to unleash remained stuck in his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back to the 'snowboat' that she had gifted to him this morning, He Changdi's heart softened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman had put him first in her thoughts. She had given him that precious blueprint without any caution at all. No one knew the value of that snowboat better than he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His image of her was slowly pulling away from the wicked woman of his previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought of that, He Sanlang's frozen heart melted into a pile of water, as if spring had come early. The issue with the armour became inconsequential to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking again at the timid-looking Chu Lian, he just couldn't bear to scold her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, He Changdi was the kind of person who kept his guard up and his thoughts to himself. He wouldn't share his thoughts just like that. Otherwise, if Chu Lian were to reveal the real reason for giving him the snowboat blueprints, he would be the one to puke blood in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was still waiting for her lunatic husband to scold her. Who could have thought that she wouldn't hear anything from He Changdi at all, even though her neck was already starting to hurt from keeping it lowered?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked up and cast a quick glance at He Changdi...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Only to realise that he was looking right back at her with that deep gaze of his. The emotions swirling in his eyes were just too strange. Chu Lian shivered; why did she feel like he was going to eat her up in the next instant...</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting caught by Chu Lian, He Changdi shifted his gaze away and coughed awkwardly. He picked up the chest plate from the floor. Under Chu Lian's frightened gaze, he wiped the chest plate clean and placed it back over the brazier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He moved a plate of raw beef slices that hadn't been grilled in front of Chu Lian and said, "Cook this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian thought that she was hallucinating. She replied with a dazed, "Ah?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi tried his best to adjust his expression and make it as neutral as possible instead of cold and unapproachable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I didn't eat just now. I'm still hungry."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shot a doubtful glance at him. She hadn't been watching him just now, so she didn't know if he was speaking the truth. Among that pack of &nbsp;hungry wolves, had he really not eaten at all?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Changdi's eyes met hers, Chu Lian could only admit defeat and help him grill the meat...</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Chu Lian skilfully flipped the beef slices on the metal plate, the sound of the meat sizzling was audible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She took up the plate of seasoning and asked, "Do you eat spicy food?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was staring at Chu Lian's fair hands, lost in thought. He didn't seem to hear Chu Lian's question at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian made an exaggerated roll of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was going on with her lunatic husband? It was bad enough that he had chased everyone out of the tent. Now he was making her cook for him personally. However, when she asked him what flavour he would like to have, he actually had the audacity to doze off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian continued complaining in her heart and 'accidentally' shook her hand twice, adding in twice the usual amount of chilli powder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hehe... Since you're not going to reply, I'll let you have all the spice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She finished grilling the beef slices and placed them neatly on a plate. They looked delicious and alluring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian personally set the dish in front of He Sanlang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang stared at the grilled beef slices in front of him, finally feeling satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His wife should only care and cook for him alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although He Changdi felt happy inside, there wasn't much change in his expression. Chu Lian sat back down next to him and watched as he used his wooden chopsticks to put a slice of meat into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, He Changdi's body stiffened for an instant before returning to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang ate very elegantly. Even though his chopsticks moved at a rapid pace, his motions were still a joy to watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Chu Lian watched him devour piece after piece until all the meat on the plate was gone, her eyes widened in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was going on? Had He Changdi been born in Sichuan in his previous life? How was he so good at eating spicy food?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been the one to grill the meat and she had been the one who personally brought the chilli powder all the way from the capital. She knew very well how spicy it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was already considered someone who could hold her spice, and she considered a fingernail’s worth of powder to be good enough. But when she had been cooking the meat for He Changdi, she had used two to three times that amount!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s expression hadn't even changed, like he hadn’t noticed the spice at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If not for the lack of any spicy seasoning like this chilli powder in the Great Wu Dynasty, Chu Lian might have suspected that he was the kind to eat exclusively spicy food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Lian found out very quickly that she was wrong.</span></p>
