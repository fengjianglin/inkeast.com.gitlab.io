 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 75:&nbsp;He Finally Did Something Right (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian slept soundly all the way till morning. The storm last night had lowered the usual heat of the day, and dewdrops hung on the grass and flowers in their little garden. After taking in a breath of the morning air, she felt very refreshed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next thing she did upon waking up was to stare at the auspicious tapestry of fertility on the canopy of the bed while lost in thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the original novel, ‘Chu Lian’ had set fire to the main kitchen, so that the Eldest Young Madam, Madam Zou, would become heavily injured and pass on the household management rights to her. Madam Zou’s maiden family was House Dingyuan, and she was the eldest legitimate granddaughter of Marquis Dingyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be Old Marquis Dingyuan’s sixtieth birthday tomorrow. As relatives through marriage, the Jing’an Estate would have to attend to express their well wishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou had been heavily injured in the original story, so she had been unable to attend. Thus, Matriarch He had brought ‘Chu Lian’ along with her to send their congratulations to the Dingyuan Estate. ‘Chu Lian’ had not only met Xiao Bojian in the Dingyuan Estate, but a series of events had happened that destroyed ‘Chu Lian’s’ reputation and sowed the seeds of suspicion between ‘Chu Lian’ and Matriarch He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she knew what kind of disaster was going to happen at the Dingyuan Estate, she had to find a way to avoid going there at all costs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, Madam Zou was perfectly well now. Her attendance at that event wouldn’t make an impact on the Jing’an Estate at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After completing her plans, Chu Lian got out from bed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This morning, she taught Xiyan how to make steamed soup dumplings. When a basket of soup dumplings was brought down from the tower of steamer baskets, she could see wisps of hot air rising from it. Chu Lian picked one dumpling up and bit a small hole at the top before gently sucking out all the fragrant juices within. She had purposely made them perfectly bite-sized, so she ate the whole dumpling in a single bite. There was no better feeling in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Paired with crisp pickled cucumbers and thick rice porridge, Chu Lian ate half a basket of dumplings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining baskets were shared amongst the servants in Songtao Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they had some martial arts skills, Senior Servant Zhong, Wenqing, and Wenlan were able to take a whole basket for themselves. There wasn’t any trace of their haughtiness or calm from last night as the three of them wolfed down their food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s mouth twitched as she watched them. She wondered how He Changdi would react if he found out the people he had sent to watch her had been ‘bribed’ by just two of her meals. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When they were done with breakfast, she sent for Senior Servant Zhong to ask her some questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t like to keep people on tenterhooks, and she didn’t have any knowledge of Senior Servant Zhong since she didn’t appear in the book. Thus, she just spoke in a straightforward manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong was slightly gaping. She hadn’t thought that Third Young Madam would see through Wenqing and Wenlan’s martial arts skills in just a single night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suppressed the shock in her heart and replied, “Third Young Madam, Wenqing and Wenlan have indeed undergone martial arts training.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned her gaze to Wenqing and Wenlan, who seemed average in both looks and figure to her. She continued to ask them questions purely out of curiosity. “How are Wenqing and Wenlan’s skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong felt a little dizzy. She quickly looked up in disbelief at Chu Lian. Why did it seem like Third Young Madam’s thoughts were completely different from most people? Wouldn’t most young madams ask something like, ‘Why were these servants assigned to me? To watch over me? Does my husband not trust me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she encountered such questions, she could simply reply: ‘Third Young Madam, you’re thinking too much of it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this young madam was completely deviating from the script. She couldn’t even speak the lines she had prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong swallowed back a mouthful of blood. A twitch developed in her eyelid as she looked towards Wenqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she received the senior servant’s pleading look, Wenqing quickly stepped forward and said proudly, “Replying to Third Young Madam, this servant can deal with four or five normal men easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong: …...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the usually unflustered Wenqing had been led away from their main purpose by Third Young Madam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had been sent here to keep a close watch on Third Young Madam! What was Wenqing trying to do, standing there like a loyal little puppy waiting to be praised by her mistress?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong suspected that if she stuck a wagging tail onto Wenqing’s back right now, it would fit her perfectly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt the urge to give them a talking to once they were dismissed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had simply been guessing at Wenqing and Wenlan’s martial arts ability yesterday. Now that she had gotten their confirmation, Chu Lian got excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her shiny black eyes lit up like stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could use martial arts! How impressive! They were her free bodyguards from now on whenever she stepped out of the estate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That lunatic He Changdi had finally done something right.</span></p>
