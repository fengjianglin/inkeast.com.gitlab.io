 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 85: Wager (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong's body swayed a little. Luckily, Miss Su caught her and held her upright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Su also looked tense. Even back at the Ying Estate, Sixth Sister had always tried to appear strong despite being out of favour. However, doing so in a situation like this was just silly; she should’ve just kept her head down instead of standing out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eldest Sister-in-Law, are you alright?" Miss Su whispered in concern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong pressed a hand against her forehead before waving her off. "I'm fine."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The progression of events even frightened Eighth Miss, Miss Yuan. Even if Chu Lian was disgraced, they would still be fine by virtue of her having already married out of the estate. Plus, she belonged to House Jing’an now, so she would surely be disciplined by Matriarch He. However, now that things were at this point and Madam Huang was clearly angry, if Chu Lian were to mess up, both House Ying and House Jing'an would be pulled down together with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Yuan was a little afraid now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She carefully pulled on Madam Rong's sleeve and begged quietly, "Eldest Sister-in-Law, let's leave now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong looked around her. She did want to leave, but when she caught sight of the occasional glances thrown her way...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stiffened up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could she leave in a situation like this? Although no one was speaking, plenty of eyes were watching her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she were to leave now, news might spread that she didn't care about her sisters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong felt immensely regretful. To her, Chu Lian was to blame for everything!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I believe House Jing'an's Third Young Madam didn't do it on purpose. For a young girl, a thousand taels is a huge sum. If Third Young Madam can truly make longevity peach buns that are better than Mr Wang's, then I'll give her this coral bracelet to calm her nerves."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right when Madam Huang had ordered someone to bring Chu Lian to the kitchen, a woman's voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd slowly parted to let her through. A middle-aged madam dressed in a begonia-coloured sixteen-bolt dress stepped out, accompanied by a group of people behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, whispers of discussion sprang up around them. "Lady Yang is here! Madam Huang won't be able to continue doing as she likes now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Yang? Chu Lian turned her bright, clear eyes in the direction the crowd was looking in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged madam was tall and luxuriously dressed without seeming too stately. She exuded elegance all over. The corners of her eyes were slightly tilted upwards, somewhat similar to Chu Lian’s own eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She took off the coral bracelet on her wrist and passed it over to one of her handmaids. The maidservant then moved forward and placed the bracelet onto a silver tray sitting on a stone table outside the corridor. When the bracelet hit the tray, it produced a clear ringing sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each coral bead on the bracelet was finely carved with exquisite patterns, and their colours were about the same. Amber jade beads were placed between each coral bead, showing off a beautiful contrast of red and amber. Everyone could see at first glance that it wasn't just any ordinary bracelet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was shocked. She tried to remember when this character had appeared in the book she was reading before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Yang? There was a character in the novel who matched this identity, age, and appearance. Yang Ge's wife! She was one of the most influential people among the ranks of the capital’s noble madams. Even Matriarch He had to accord her some respect if they met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This madam was one of the original 'Chu Lian's' greatest enemies...</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, 'Chu Lian' had tortured her to death with some cruel methods...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian cast a curious, measuring gaze towards Lady Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn't expected that Lady Yang, who should have been working against her, would come out now only to stand on her side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this called again? The tables have turned?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chu Lian didn't want to overthink things and make her life complicated, she wasn't so naive as to think that Lady Yang had come simply just to help her out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, she could hear some people talking in the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lady Yang and Madam Huang have been at odds since they were young unmarried ladies. It would be hard to avoid clashing over this matter today. Unfortunately, that poor Third Young Madam from House Jing'an has become a target."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian laughed inwardly. She didn't really mind being a target. No matter what Lady Yang's motives were, that coral bracelet was pretty valuable. What did she need the most now? Money! That bracelet was going to be hers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since Sister Yang has already placed something in the pot, I'll have to add in my own share." A young madam with rosy cheeks standing behind Lady Yang spoke up. She looked to be in her twenties, and was dressed in a silk green dress. From what Chu Lian could hear from the crowd's whispering, this was the wife of the vice minister of the Ministry of Personnel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vice minister's wife took off a butterfly-shaped golden hairpin decorated with pieces of jade from directly off her head and placed it in the silver tray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other madams behind Lady Yang followed suit, taking a single accessory off and placing it in the silver tray. There were hollowed out gold bracelets inlaid with jade, yellow jade amulets, headdresses with precious stones... All these high-quality, sparkling accessories were laid out on this ordinary silver tray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The younger madams in the crowd were completely wide-eyed in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was going on? How did these influential senior madams suddenly start fighting with each other?</span></p>
