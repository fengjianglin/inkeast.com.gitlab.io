 <p><strong>Chapter 166: Teaching a Lesson (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon recalling the insults he had thrown at Chu Lian earlier, Ah Cai started to tremble. The face that had been full of fighting spirit earlier was now completely ashen pale in fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two bailiffs took the bound Mrs Wang and Ah Cai off the hands of the manservants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a puddle appeared on the cyan floor tiles, followed by a terrible fishy stink. When Wenqing looked down, she realised that the crotch of Ah Cai’s pants were soaked…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had actually peed himself in fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Manager Wang saw Ah Cai’s state, shame flooded his being. He glared at Ah Cai angrily; this was all that idiot’s fault!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Wang had just gone to the gambling dens and lost some money. Afraid that Mrs Wang would find out, he had entered sneakily through the back door and bumped into Ah Cai when he was bringing out the dishes to the main hall. Ah Cai had cooked up this plan to get Manager Wang to bring over some bailiffs they were familiar with to scare Chu Lian and have her cough up more money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would have thought that they would shoot themselves in their own foot!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course Manager Wang was filled with hatred!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bearded bailiff came over to Chu Lian eagerly and bowed at the waist, “Does Honoured One have any other orders?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t bother speaking with the leader. Instead, she turned to Wenqing and said, “Bring me the account books from the counter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite feeling the embarrassment of getting ignored, the bailiff didn’t dare to voice any complaints. The gap in their statuses was too great. Furthermore, judging by the ability that the maidservant had showed just now, he didn’t dare to underestimate them. Even if this young madam hadn’t shown off her imperial identity, the five of them wouldn’t have been a match for that one maidservant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought of that, the curly bearded leader appeared even more respectful and humble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Wang startled when he heard Chu Lian’s command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What? The accounts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone who was affiliated with the imperial family actually wanted to see the accounts of his little restaurant? There had to be something wrong with that, or he had misheard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Wang gulped in fright. Somehow, he managed to say a few words. “Hon… Honoured One, what’s there to see in our little restaurant’s books? They are merely a bunch of insignificant numbers; please do not tire yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked down at Manager Wang. “Manager Wang, I forgot to mention this to you. Guilin Restaurant has been given to me by my grandmother. This place will not require your services any longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like Manager Wang had been struck by lightning!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shock factor from this simple sentence of Chu Lian’s was worlds above the time she brought out the jade token carrying the insignia of the imperial family!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Wang’s eyes looked like they were going to pop out of his head. Chu Lian’s words echoed in his mind, and when he finally processed what they meant, he immediately knew her true identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young madam from House Jing’an? Who else could she be other than the third young madam, the most recent addition to the Jing’an household? Furthermore, this third young madam had only just received a personal title of Honoured Lady two days ago, conferred to her by the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had just tried to bully their own masters!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had this young madam simply been a member of the imperial family, then their punishment for offending her would’ve only been spending a few nights in a jail cell. With their connection to House Jing’an, they wouldn’t have even experienced any hardship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, things were totally different now. Third Young Madam was not only a member of the imperial family, but she was also a member of House Jing’an. For mere servants of House Jing’an, like them, Third Young Madam’s words were law. To make matters worse, she was also the new master of Guilin Restaurant! Even if she wanted their lives taken, all she had to do was say the word! </span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment after, a wet patch appeared under Manager Wang’s crotch as well...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The apple didn’t fall far from the tree. Both uncle and nephew had peed their pants; what an impressive ability!</span></p>
