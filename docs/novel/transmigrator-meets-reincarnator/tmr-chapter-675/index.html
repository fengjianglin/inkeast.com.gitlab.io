 <p><strong>Chapter 675: Causing Her Own Demise (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi looked her over once before ordering, “Put it down and get out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jingyan was startled by the abrupt command. She hadn’t thought that He Changdi would be so cold and indifferent towards her. His gaze hadn’t even lingered a second longer over her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jingyan bit her lip and made a decision in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She only had one chance! If she missed out on this one chance, then she would have to give up on her dream!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She took a deep breath and put on the most seductive expression she could muster. Ignoring He Changdi’s order to set down the box and leave, she sashayed up to He Changdi and put the food box down at one corner of the table. In a soft voice, she said, “Master, Madam is worried for your health, so Madam specially told me to watch Master drink the soup down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cold aura that He Changdi had kept under control suddenly burst out in full force. He had been considering the fact that Jingyan had been serving as Chu Lian’s maidservant ever since she had married him, so he had given her some leeway. However, since she wanted to invite her own death, he wasn’t going to show her any mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jingyan hadn’t noticed the subtle changes in He Changdi. She was so nervous that her heart was about to leap out of her chest. She couldn’t possibly have taken note of the expression on He Changdi’s slightly bowed head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her slender hand moved to her waist. With a gentle tug, her thin nightgown came undone, revealing her long, snow-white legs and her full bosom…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jingyan gathered her courage and leaned over the table, revealing her exposed chest to He Changdi’s sight. Her voice wavered as she offered in a delicate and frail manner, “Ma… Master, this servant will help you drink the soup…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rage in He Changdi’s chest reached its peak upon hearing Jingyan’s shy words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He abruptly lifted his head. The frozen expression on his handsome face had finally changed, but it wasn’t the change Jingyan had been hoping for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His handsome mien was slightly contorted into a malevolent expression, and his deep eyes were like ancient glaciers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jingyan was scared stiff by that sinister look on He Changdi. Her eyes widened in disbelief as she lost all strength and collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Jingyan had finally realised how stupid her decision had been. However, it was too late for regrets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi didn’t have an ounce of pity for a woman like this. A corner of his lips tugged upwards into a smirk. That smirk wasn’t sympathetic at all; rather, it made him seem even more terrifying and cruel. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, the dishevelled and half-naked Jingyan was kicked right out of the study. She rolled and landed right by Laiyue’s feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue: ……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, He Changdi’s angry roar rang loud from the study. “Once you’ve taken care of her, go and punish yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue’s own expression turned overcast and he glared fiercely at the unconscious Jingyan. He was extremely vexed inside. This damned woman had caused trouble for him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he felt very indignant and wanted to beat up Jingyan to relieve his anger for a bit, Laiyue didn’t dare to tarry on fulfilling He Changdi’s order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out a black bamboo whistle and blew on it. In a short moment, two guards appeared from the darkness. With just a simple hand gesture from Laiyue, the two black-clad guards took the unconscious Jingyan away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue hesitated for a moment before turning back and entering the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi looked up and swept a cold gaze over the manservant, making Laiyue freeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue showed a pained expression as he explained, “Master, it’s not that this servant didn’t have doubts, but Jingyan was one of Madam’s handmaids…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can shut up now. Take this box of food to Uncle Miao and have him check if there’s anything else in the soup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue didn’t dare to continue trying to explain himself. He immediately agreed and carried the box of food out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has Wenqing left yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s already gone. When you kicked Jingyan out, Miss Wenqing left immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you’re dismissed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue bowed as he walked backwards out of the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Wenqing explained everything that had happened, the tension in Chu Lian’s heart faded away. She could finally lay back down and have a good night’s rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t until right before daybreak that He Changdi finished his work and returned to Songtao Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Uncle Miao had actually come all the way over to the study just now because of that aphrodisiac soup, putting He Changdi in an awkward spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Uncle Miao had even assumed that he had some hidden illness! The doctor had insisted on taking his pulse before finally leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt someone hold her in her sleep. She struggled a little in her half-awake state, but she couldn’t get free. In the end, she opened her eyes reluctantly, only to meet with He Changdi’s deep, dark gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi chuckled and pinched her pert little nose. “You silly goose. Are you satisfied now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s mind was still foggy, so she couldn’t really process what he had said. She pouted and repeated the insult back at him. “You’re the silly goose!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi didn’t retort. He simply looked at the cute and sleepy Chu Lian in his arms with a warm gaze, unable to resist kissing her fluttering eyelids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did our little one disturb you these two days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Great Doctor Miao had diagnosed that she was carrying, the pregnancy symptoms had immediately started up with a vengeance. Chu Lian puked out whatever she ate. Sometimes she would be able to eat a bowl of food, only for it to come back up later. Her appetite hadn’t been very good in the first place. After the symptoms started, she ate even less.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Senior Servant Zhong and Great Doctor Miao had told her that she had to eat even if she didn’t feel very hungry if she wanted to keep the child. Thus, she hadn’t been having a very good time so far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t until the three month mark had passed that the symptoms had slowly abated and her appetite had returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Chu Lian could down two bowls of rice by herself in one go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps due to the scare from last month, He Changdi couldn’t seem to set his worries aside. He asked about her condition daily and whether the little one had made trouble for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shook her head. After the first three months, the little bun seemed to have settled down. Other than a slight bump in her abdomen, she hardly felt pregnant, other than being just a little sleepier than usual.</span></p>
