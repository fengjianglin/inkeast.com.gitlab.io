 <p><strong>Chapter 678: Matriarch He's Good Intentions (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was only three months pregnant, so counting back the days, it had happened only after they had returned to the capital. It was definitely their He Family’s child and not some wild bastard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she got the news, the matriarch went into the ancestral hall to offer up incense with the help of Senior Servant Liu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was already a bag of old bones, she insisted on kneeling for two whole hours, begging for Chu Lian’s first child to be a boy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Senior Servant Liu couldn’t move her from her prayers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she returned from the ancestral hall, Matriarch He started preparing things for her unborn great-grandson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Liu noticed that the old matriarch wouldn’t sit still and tried to coax her into doing otherwise. “Matriarch, you don’t have to be so rushed. There’s still another six months to go! Furthermore, we don’t know if it’ll be a little girl or boy. If you prepare the wrong items, then it will go to waste.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch’s expression turned fierce upon hearing such words from Senior Servant Liu. “What nonsense are you speaking? Of course it’s going to be a little boy. Senior Servant Zhou, follow my instructions and prepare all the items for a boy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Liu had no choice but to follow along with what Matriarch He wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the servants were busying themselves, Muxiang stood stock-still like a statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ran back to her own room in a panic and locked the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the door was shut, she could no longer hide the resentful, sinister expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From an obedient maidservant, she changed into a demon who had just crawled up from hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t supposed to be like this! It wasn’t supposed to be...!” She leaned bonelessly against the door, sliding down into a squat. She grabbed at her hair, her eyes staring wildly into space, as if she couldn’t accept the news she had just heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her past life, she hadn’t had any children since she hadn’t consummated her marriage with He Changdi. After she had gotten together with Xiao Bojian, although the two of them had gone to bed together many times, she hadn’t gotten pregnant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had always thought it was her body that wasn’t fertile, and this had thus been a source of regret for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she opened her eyes and realised that she had been reincarnated into one of Matriarch He’s maidservants, she had first felt cold, hard fear. Later on, that had been mixed with a thread of elatement, as this body was perfectly healthy. In the future, when she got He Changdi back again, she could give birth to their children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the lack of any good news from the current Chu Lian and He Changdi after they had been married for so long had proven her guess from her past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet how had this happened?! Wasn’t her old body supposed to be infertile? How had that imposter gotten pregnant with He Changdi’s child?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could it be!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was the only one in the world who could bear children for He Changdi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Muxiang thought about it, the angrier she was. Slowly, that anger was mixed with depression. She wanted to rush over to Chu Lian right now and tear her to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why?! How! That body was hers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was the one who was supposed to marry He Changdi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could that monstrous imposter use her body and take her husband and live so happily?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her extreme rage, Muxiang destroyed everything she could move in her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was done, she laid panting over the desk, her eyes bitterly cold as she looked at the bits and pieces of broken things on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked like a viper eyeing her prey and wanting it dead!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That monster had stolen away her body… She wasn’t going to let it go so easily!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Changdi returned in the evening, Chu Lian had already ordered the servants to prepare everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an and Chu Lian sat in the same carriage, while He Changdi rode his horse alongside them with the guards all the way back to the old residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already made a promise with the rest of the family that they would meet at the Jing’an Estate tonight. Even He Changjue had returned early.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once they got to the Jing’an Estate, Chu Lian and He Changdi bowed in greeting to Matriarch He and Count Jing’an before taking their seats at the large round table in the center of the parlour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This intimate family banquet was bathed in a joyous and harmonious atmosphere. Even Matriarch He didn’t make any sour comments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they were done, the family moved to the parlour of Qingxi Hall to have tea and chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that Chu Lian was pregnant, Matriarch He’s mood seemed to be much better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi hadn’t returned to the old residence in some time as well, so Matriarch He pulled him alongside her to catch up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that He Changdi had become much thinner, the matriarch’s heart ached for her youngest grandson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at you, why don’t you know how to take care of yourself outside? You’ve become so thin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stiffened up a little, but she didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Matriarch He might not have meant anything by her words, it didn’t sound like that to the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It sounded like the matriarch was blaming her granddaughter-in-law for not taking good care of her husband and allowing him to get so thin from overworking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s cool and handsome face didn’t change at all. When he spoke, it was in his usual low tones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandmother, you must be mistaken. I haven’t lost weight at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was rare that He Changdi would return to visit them, the matriarch didn’t contest his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, you haven’t gotten thinner at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an followed up to smooth out the awkwardness lingering in the air. “It looks like Sanlang has gotten even more muscular than before. Mother, you don’t have to worry at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The family continued chatting happily. Count Jing’an didn’t say much, but his gaze was full of satisfaction and affection when looking at his youngest son and daughter-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the family was enjoying the peaceful atmosphere, the matriarch suddenly spoke up. “Sanlang, Sanlang’s wife, since you’ve already moved out, then so be it. I can’t stop you anyway. In the past, it didn’t matter much that it was only the two of you in your estate, but things are different now. Sanlang’s wife is pregnant. We can’t be careless with this. I’m too old and I can’t walk well now, so I can’t move over to your estate. However, I can’t rest easy with the two of you so far away. I thought over this for some time, and I’ve decided to send Muxiang back with you. She can serve Sanlang’s wife and report her condition to me. I’ll feel more reassured this way.”</span></p>
