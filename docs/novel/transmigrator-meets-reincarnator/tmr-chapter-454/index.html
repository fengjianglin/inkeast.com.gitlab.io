 <p><strong>Chapter 454: Returning Home (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Chu Lian’s mouth twitched. Nothing good ever happened every time she met Prince Jin. He hadn’t left a shred of mercy in his words for her. Didn’t he know that women hated being called fat?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, it was the frail-looking, thin type of beauty that was favoured in the Great Wu Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian managed to squeeze out an awkward smile for Prince Jin before introducing Sima Hui to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sima Hui had a straightforward and brave air about her from her time spent in the army. She had traded the reserve that most noble ladies possessed for an easygoing, dignified attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, the fourth prince who rarely interacted with unfamiliar ladies got along with her rather well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian followed behind them while holding the reins of her mare, looking at their backs with the spark of an idea forming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The author of the original story had only mentioned Sima Hui in a single line. From what she knew, the fourth prince had never even met Sima Hui before. However, the two of them seemed to get along like old friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s almond-shaped eyes began to sparkle. Even her lips curved up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was immersed in her thoughts, her horse suddenly changed directions and tried to head towards the side of the road, giving her a fright. When she quickly turned to look, she realised that it was all He Sanlang’s doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She complained, “He Changdi! What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang turned to her with a faint smile as he continued leading her horse away. “Teaching you to ride.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian cried out in alarm as the gentle mare under her suddenly started galloping. Her face turned pale from fright. Just as she felt as if she were going to fall off the horse, something tightened around her waist and pulled her up into the air. When she finally regained her senses, she was already sitting on He Changdi’s mount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was still in a panicked state. She tightly held onto He Sanlang’s narrow waist once she was ensconced in his embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite having only one hand on the reins and one arm around Chu Lian, He Changdi was at ease even as his steed was galloping freely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they travelled under the clear sky, there was a warm, genial smile on He Sanlang’s face that had never been seen before even in his past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Chu Lian had recovered her breath, she pinched his arm in a fit of anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s eye twitched in pain. He lowered his gaze and helplessly said, “Chu Lian, if you continue pinching me that hard, I’ll lose my grip on the reins and we’ll really fall off the horse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian glared at him fiercely. “You’re not allowed to do that anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang looked down and placed a kiss on her smooth, flushed cheek. “Then you can’t let anyone else teach you how to ride next time. Only I’m allowed to teach you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know how to ride now, so there’s no need for you to teach me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t hard to ride a horse. The hard part was getting used to the bumpy ride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi raised an eyebrow in question. “Are you sure you’ve already learned how to ride?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian refused to give in. “Didn’t you watch me just now? I was riding that horse perfectly fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Chu Lian finished speaking, He Changdi urged his horse on with a low shout. The handsome steed responded by accelerating its stride and flying into a gallop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scenery on either side began to blur as the ride turned even bumpier. Chu Lian was frightened by the sudden speed and clung tightly onto He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, she could still hear He Changdi’s husky, magnetic voice by her ear say, “Are you still sure that you know how to ride a horse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had already realised that this fellow was purposely teasing her. Her cheeks were flushed red with anger as she exclaimed, “He Changdi! Why are you so childish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only response she could hear through the winds blowing past was He Changdi’s bright and open laughter, which she could feel through his shaking chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was startled. She couldn’t help but look up at He Changdi’s sharp jaw. Right now, she couldn’t find a hint of the original gloominess he had always worn on his face ever since the first time she met him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was genuinely, truly living in the warm, happy moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian suddenly had the urge to freeze time to keep him in his current state, freed of all his worries and burdens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tightened her hold around him and buried her head into his chest. Having lost all desire to retort, she broke out into a whole-hearted smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time the couple returned to the group, an hour had already passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fierce winds they had encountered on horseback had messed up their cloaks, so He Sanlang and Chu Lian both looked a little haggard. However, the messiness of their clothes couldn’t hide the pure joy on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi personally escorted Chu Lian to her carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hongyu eyed the two of them from not too far away with shining eyes. He tsked to himself and let out a chuckle with a wretched expression. “Doesn’t Brother He know how to control himself? We’re still on the road here! He just took out Sister-in-Law like that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Mai had no idea what to say to the brat. He glared at him and threw a chestnut at his silly head. “You little brat. What are you thinking in that head of yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hongyu held his wounded head in a pitiful manner and protested, “Brother Zhang, you’re not allowed to hit my head! My mother already thinks I’m stupid enough. If you keep hitting me, I won’t be able to get a wife in the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Captain Guo burst out into raucous laughter while watching the two banter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The victory in the war against the Tuhuns had lifted the mood of their long-suffering soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They entered the capital on the second day of the second month of the lunar calendar, the day of the Longtaitou Festival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chengping Emperor had sent officials from the Ministry of Rites to welcome them five kilometres out from the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>General Qian and his troops would have to change into special ceremonial armour and enter the capital under the lead of the officials armed with ceremonial weapons. They would then enter the palace for the official bestowal ceremony. This was the highest honour that could be given to a military official returning home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also due to this arrangement that Prince Jin and Chu Lian had to part ways with the border troops as they neared the outskirts of the capital.</span></p>
