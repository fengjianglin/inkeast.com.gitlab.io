 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s eyes narrowed. When he recalled that his two older brothers were still sleeping in the outer court, he lifted Chu Lian up from the bathtub and covered her snugly with his large sleep shirt. He carried her over to the bed and set her down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang petted her smooth hair and said, “Lian’er, you should sleep first. I’m going to take a look at the outer court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly changed into a fresh set of clothes. As he was about to leave, he found that Chu Lian had also changed into a normal dress. She tugged at his sleeve and said, “I’m going with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi hesitated for a moment before taking her hand. As they passed the changing screen, he swiped up a brocade cloak with a fox fur hood and put it on Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple took some servants with them as they rushed over to the main study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right as they left the inner court, the family soldiers who were on night duty came over to meet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Huang Zhijian who was on duty tonight. He and the four young guards behind him bowed in greeting towards He Changdi and Chu Lian. “Third Young Master, is anything the matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang cast an indifferent glance over Huang Zhijian. “We’re going to the main study in the outer court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Zhijian didn’t question him and quietly followed behind the two masters with the other guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the outside, the main study was shrouded in darkness. Only a single row of dim lanterns lit up the corridors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Zhijian could sense that something was wrong. At this time of night, there should have been at least a few manservants on guard outside the main study, yet there were none...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if there wasn’t anyone using the main study, there would be two or three manservants on duty inside. They would rest in the side rooms of the study at night and keep watch over the valuable books and items within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two of their masters sleeping in the study right now, but there wasn’t a single servant outside!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi paused for a moment in the corridor outside the main study. He was about to push open the doors to enter, but he realised that the doors had been locked from the inside. He immediately kicked the doors open and took Chu Lian with him as they strode into the section on the left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two smaller rooms here, with entrances facing each other. He Changdi had been sleeping in the west one at first, while He Erlang was sleeping in the one to the east. When they entered the east room and realised that there was no one inside, they checked the west room and found that Erlang was sleeping soundly within. His clothes were still the same as before, so He Changdi relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, He Changdi and Chu Lian headed over to the section on the right of the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he tried to open the door, he found that the room had been locked from the inside!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s first reaction was to kick in the doors again. A twitch developed in Chu Lian’s eyes as she watched her husband’s violent actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was when they walked up to the bedchamber and shoved the curtains open that they sucked in gasps of surprise!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bed was a chaotic mess. Various items of clothing were strewn all over and there was the distinctive smell of sex in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the room wasn’t lit, one of the guards behind them lifted his lantern, casting light upon the situation inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two naked bodies lying on the bed… were He Dalang and Pan Nianzhen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything had happened so abruptly that Pan Nianzhen only started to awaken after He Changdi kicked down the doors. Her head was aching so much it felt like it was being pierced by a thousand silver needles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she opened her eyes to see He Changdi fully dressed beside the bed, with icy cold eyes directed towards her, her body immediately froze up. The expression on her face slowly collapsed into despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian hated the way Pan Nianzhen was looking at He Changdi, so she stepped forward to block her husband from her gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Pan Nianzhen caught sight of Chu Lian, she finally lost control of her emotions and let out a high-pitched wail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following Pan Nianzhen’s scream, lanterns flared to life all over the previously dark Jing’an Estate. It was going to be a sleepless night for House Jing’an.</span></p>
