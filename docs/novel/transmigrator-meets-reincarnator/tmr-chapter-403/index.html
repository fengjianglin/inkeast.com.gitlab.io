 <p><strong>Chapter 403: In the Warm Pen (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Men had higher body temperatures than women in the first place. Once Chu Lian had gotten close to this heat source, she subconsciously wanted to get even closer. It was all part of her natural instincts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to hug her heat source tight, one of her legs even found its way between He Sanlang's legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cool-faced He Changdi looked down at Chu Lian for a moment as his body stiffened. After some time, he simply let her do as she liked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were each down to a single layer of clothing, which was thin to begin with. He Sanlang had one arm under Chu Lian's neck while the other circled around her slender waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was exhaling warm puffs of air around He Changdi's collarbone. One of her hands had subconsciously curled around the collar of He Changdi's shirt, like she trusted and relied on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple was stuck close to each other without any gaps between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang's cool mask had melted a little by now. When his arms were filled with Chu Lian, it felt as if his heart was full, too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hidden from Chu Lian's view, He Changdi sighed in satisfaction and shut his eyes, as if he was about to join Chu Lian in slumber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn't been able to rest for a very long time. His nerves had been tightly wound for the entire search, and he had only been able to relax once she had finally returned to his arms again, so he was rather tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s eyelids slowly slid shut and he was just about to fall asleep when Chu Lian suddenly moved. She wriggled as if trying to burrow deeper into his embrace. It seemed like her current position wasn't too comfortable and she wanted to change into a better one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Lian moved, He Changdi completely lost all traces of sleepiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He loosened his hold on her and let Chu Lian shift into a more comfortable position. Once she had fallen back into deep slumber, he slowly tightened his arms around her again, keeping her safe and secure in his embrace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after all that movement, He Sanlang didn't feel like sleeping any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Helpless, he sighed and stared blankly at his surroundings while keeping a tight hold of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a short moment, He Changdi started to feel like something wasn't quite right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His expression changed and his ears started to flush red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Chu Lian was ensconced in his arms, her mouth was very close to his Adam's apple. The warm puffs of her breath were making his mouth dry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been too worried earlier to think about how intimate their actions were. Now that he had calmed down, everything that had escaped his notice earlier was standing out. It was hard for him to ignore it again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the two of them were bundled so tightly together and wearing such thin clothing, he could feel the softness of her chest on his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palm that he had placed on Chu Lian's waist suddenly felt burning hot. He froze up, not daring to make the slightest bit of movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to forcefully adjust his breathing, trying to make himself calm down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang's tall body was now tensed like a drawn bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bow that was already pulled to its limit and was about to shoot at any moment now with all its stored energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sleeping Chu Lian just had to start getting restless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang had been tense with restraint due to the overwhelmingly strange sensations he was experiencing. His arms had turned into tight bars around Chu Lian, holding her in a vice-like grip as he put all his effort into trying to repress his feelings. Chu Lian wanted to escape the uncomfortably tight hold around her, so she started to wriggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She rubbed her body against He Changdi's and let out an uncomfortable moan. It was only then that He Changdi finally realised that he was crushing her. Panicked, he immediately released her, a light blush dyeing his handsome face pink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian wriggled a few more times before realising that her uncomfortable bindings had disappeared. She smacked her lips and slipped back into peaceful slumber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi's body remained stiff for a long time after that. It wasn't until Chu Lian stopped moving that he finally dared to move. The pen's surface area was small; there was only so much space for them to sleep on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afraid that she would still be affected by the cold, He Changdi could only attempt to hug Chu Lian once again, but more carefully this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached out towards her under the blanket and wrapped his arm around Chu Lian's waist. However, what his fingers touched wasn't smooth fabric- rather, it was something soft and warm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi reverted into a statue again. This time, his whole face turned a bright lobster red. The thoughts that he had managed to suppress only a few moments ago came flooding back into his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's earlier movements had caused her clothes to unravel a little, revealing some of the smooth skin around her waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang wanted to remove his scorching hot palm from Chu Lian's bare skin, but it was like it was stuck there- he couldn't move it at all...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although He Changdi's expression remained as cool as usual, the raging blush on his face revealed his inner turmoil. He swallowed hard, gulping a mouthful of saliva.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi looked down at the woman in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her lips were currently formed into a pout and her hair was slightly messy. A few strands had fallen over her flushed cheeks, right under her eyes. Her cute little nose was twitching slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang's gaze couldn't help but follow the line of her nose down to Chu Lian's slightly parted red lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pressed his own dry lips together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inch by inch, He Sanlang moved closer until he could feel the warmth of her breath on his face. At this point, he forced himself to stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was fighting a massive battle in his heart. His breathing became more hurried. In the end, he could no longer hold himself back and he placed a light kiss on Chu Lian's soft lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palm resting at her waist glided over her skin before moving upwards in a very natural movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still remembered the heavenly softness that had been pressed against his hard chest earlier, tempting him to lose control of himself...</span></p>
