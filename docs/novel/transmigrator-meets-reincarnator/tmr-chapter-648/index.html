 <p><span style>A dim hexagonal lantern had been lit. It was hung on a lampstand near the head of the bed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the dim light, He Changdi could clearly see Chu Lian’s sleeping face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was wearing a light pink nightgown embroidered with beautiful flowers, curled up in a fetal position with both of her hands in front of her chest. Her soft hair covered the entire pillow, while two stray locks of hair framed her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her skin was porcelain-white, which should have been a beautiful colour on her. However, she appeared wan instead beneath that certain angle of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her rosy lips were pursed slightly. There was a layer of moisture on her thick, curled eyelashes, which were still glistening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi suddenly felt like someone had stuffed a large rock into his heart. It weighed down on him and made him feel terribly uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached out with one hand, wanting to touch Chu Lian’s delicate face, but her eyebrows twitched. Still in the throes of sleep, she shook her head twice and tears streamed down her face again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on this situation, Chu Lian was obviously having a nightmare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if something stung the hand that He Sanlang extended, his hand twitched and drew back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he recalled Xiao Bojian saving and embracing her this morning, veins on his forehead throbbed in anger. He couldn’t control the jealousy and rage within his heart. He had seriously been fighting the urge to tear Xiao Bojian into pieces. After that, Chu Lian had smiled so sweetly and thanked Xiao Bojian, which was something even harder for him to endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the incident wasn’t Chu Lian’s fault and that she had to express her gratitude to Xiao Bojian. However, he still couldn’t suppress the rage within his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he gradually calmed down, he became even more fearful. He was frightened by his own extreme possessiveness towards Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t even stand seeing her standing with another man, or even engaging in normal interactions…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could only belong to him. No matter if she was smiling or crying, her face could only be directed at him alone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought of this, He Changdi covered his face of fatigue with a hand and rubbed it vigorously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi stood beside Chu Lian’s bed for a long time. However, when Chu Lian awoke again, he was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After opening her eyes, Chu Lian looked around the tent instinctively. She still didn’t see the person who she had been thinking about for the entire day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time when Wenlan came in, Chu Lian couldn’t help but ask, “Has He Changdi come back yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan shot a cautious look at Chu Lian and nodded. “Replying to Third Young Madam, Third Young Master returned at midnight yesterday. He was called out early this morning. The emperor wants to go hunting today, so most of the officials were summoned to the hunt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was usually a deep sleeper, but she hadn’t slept very well last night. If someone had slept beside her, she would have definitely sensed it. Moreover, when she woke up this morning, the bedding beside her was still very neat. Nothing had been moved, so it didn’t seem like someone had slept there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan was attentive and noticed the look in Chu Lian’s eyes. She summoned up her courage to explain, “When this servant brought hot water over this morning, I saw… I saw Third Young Master sleeping on the chaise behind the screen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian narrowed her eyes. The light in her normally clear, bright eyes instantly dimmed. When Wenlan saw that, her heart felt like it was being crushed and it ached painfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She regretted telling Third Young Madam about that matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t ask any more questions after that. She rested against the bedframe for a while with dull eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, she asked Wenqing to help her up for breakfast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The breakfast was on the table in the middle of the tent, so Wenqing helped Chu Lian walk over to the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the middle of the meal, Wenqing softly said, “Third Young Madam, this servant has something to report.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian regained her focus and cheered up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted her head and looked at Wenqing. “Tell me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Young Madam, Imperial Princess Leyao’s leg was injured after she insisted on going hunting in the woods yesterday. The imperial physician said that even after she recuperates, her leg would probably be crippled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was slightly shocked after listening to Wenqing’s words. Imperial Princess Leyao’s leg was likely going to be crippled?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at Wenqing again, and saw that she had lowered her head and stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sighed helplessly as she understood the meaning behind Wenqing’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was probably helping He Changdi explain. An explanation for him returning late at night and the reason he wasn’t concerned about her injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it simply didn’t make sense. Imperial Princess Leyao had only injured her leg. Even if she had injured her head, it still didn’t have anything to do with He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would he return late at night because of Imperial Princess Leyao?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t possibly be from the emperor’s imperial order, could it? That is, unless the emperor had nothing better to do and wanted to make things difficult for him--he, a married young man who already had a legitimate wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true that Imperial Princess Leyao had feelings for him, but she was still young. Neither Imperial Concubine Wei nor the emperor would be so ‘desperate’ to choose a married man, who was nearly ten years older than Imperial Princess Leyao, for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Lian finished eating, she set down her chopsticks and stood up. “Alright, I understand. Wenqing, Wenlan, come with me for a walk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing didn’t think that Third Young Madam would react so calmly. She felt somewhat uneasy inside and didn’t dare to speak up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pulled aside the thick curtains of the tent that kept out the wind. Then, she looked towards the wide horizon of the clear blue sky.</span></p>
