 <p><strong>Chapter 463: He Erlang Grows Up (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He was full of smiles, “Stop kneeling and get up. Look at you two. Both of you have lost weight. Do eat more later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Matriarch He was happily asking all sorts of questions and showing great concern towards He Changdi, it had become awkward for Pan Nianzhen who was at one side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Pan Nianzhen had called out ‘Second Cousin,’ she had drawn a glare from He Ying in response. She had also made a joke of herself in front of the maidservant that served her in Qingxi Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, the maidservant had managed to avoid laughing out loud by covering her mouth. She bent over slightly and whispered into Pan Nianzhen’s ear, “Miss Pan, that was Third Young Master, not the Second Young Master of our estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen’s entire body stiffened up and her face turned ashen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This… this was Third Cousin?</span></p>
 <p><span style>So he was really Third Cousin, who was already married!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Pan Nianzhen had already started questioning He Changdi’s identity when Chu Lian had followed behind him and he had held her hand disregarding other people’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that her heart was reluctant to believe in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time the maidservant had explained his identity to her, it was already too late to make herself numb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So that remarkable gentleman who had just walked past her was really the married Third Cousin...</span></p>
 <p><span style>While staying in the Jing’an Estate, she had heard the servants gossip about Third Cousin’s appearance. However, it was even more astonishing seeing him in person today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His looks could be compared to that top scholar she had seen at the Plum Pavilion in Prince Wei’s Estate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the Emperor bestowed had bestowed the title of Marquis Anyuan to Third Cousin after his great achievements at the northern border!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, the peerage of House Jing’an was merely that of a count! Third Cousin’s title was even one rank higher than her grandfather’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen couldn’t contain the glow in her eyes. She didn’t dare to lift her head, but out of the corner of her eyes, she looked at Chu Lian with much more envy and resentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after He Changdi and Chu Lian had settled down into their seats, the maidservant waiting at the entrance of the parlour announced the arrival of Second Young Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curtains wavered slightly at first before they were lifted by someone on the outside with great force. At the same time, a tall and burly young man walked in gallantly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Erlang was dressed in a black official’s robe. He had a sturdy figure and a dark complexion. He looked very similar to He Dalang, but his facial features were more refined and prominent. He gave off the impression of a very masculine young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Erlang’s appearance didn’t really fit the current aesthetics of the Great Wu Dynasty. However, if he had lived in modern times, he would have been quite popular among girls. He looked exactly like a typical manly man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was Chu Lian’s opinion of He Erlang, but it didn’t mean that Pan Nianzhen had the same thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was shocked stiff once He Changjue entered the parlour. In an instant, Pan Nianzhen’s face turned deadly pale and she lowered her head in fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really hated ‘boorish’ men like He Erlang. He looked no different than the shirtless labourers working on the docks. He Erlang looked like a classic example of a simple-minded person with all brawn and no brains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lowered her head, pursed her lips pursed, and remained silent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, He Erlang didn’t even notice the sudden addition of a new cousin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled and went up to pay respects to his grandmother, “May Grandmother remain healthy as always. Grandson gives a belated New Year greeting to Grandmother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He gave He Erlang a glare, “A belated New Year? Don’t you know what date it is? It’s already ten days into February.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Erlang rubbed the back of his head and laughed sheepishly as he was helped up by Matriarch He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger rose up in Matriarch He while looking at the cause of the thorn in her heart, “You’re not allowed to run off this year! I’ve heard that the Emperor intends to let you join the Imperial Guards. You had better seize this opportunity. Since you’re in the capital now, let’s also take care of your marriage as well this year. Just take a look around you! In this entire capital, are there any young masters around your age that are still single?! Are you trying to make this old lady and your parents die of frustration?!” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Erlang normally hated it when the elders in the family mentioned marriage. Whenever the topic came up, he would lose his temper and patience. His next course of action was usually to avoid returning to the estate after that. However, his attitude had been completely reversed this time .</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled and bent over at the waist to hold on to Matriarch He’s arm. He looked like a big circus bear nodding and bowing to please people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandmother, I’ve made you worry in the past. This year, I’ll listen to you and bring back a Granddaughter-in-law for you.”</span></p>
