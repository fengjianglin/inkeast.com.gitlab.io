 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 62: Abandoning His Wife and Entering the Army (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's big, clear eyes blinked once. What was going on? She was alive and well; why were they all looking at her like she had been suffering in silence all alone and they had just found out about it? What was there to pity her for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grandmother, Eldest Brother, Eldest Sister-in-Law, Second Brother."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian bobbed in greeting to each senior family member.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He waved her over. "Lian'er, come sit next to Grandmother."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah? Chu Lian glanced at her eldest brother and sister-in-law sitting a tier below the matriarch. Although she was reluctant to, she could only slowly walk over to the matriarch's side. Matriarch He's warm hands tugged her down to sit on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked at Madam Zou and checked for any hint of jealousy on her face, but upon seeing none, she relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch kept staring at her pretty granddaughter-in-law before she inwardly sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian found it weird that everyone was staring at her. Even the matriarch was holding one of her hands, patting it gently as if to comfort her for some mysterious reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She innocently blinked. "Grandmother, is anything the matter?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He patted her head gently, absentmindedly noticing that her hair hadn't been brushed thoroughly in her rush to get here, and sighed. "Lian'er, Grandmother has something to tell you. But first, promise Grandmother that you won't get angry."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian smiled to herself. As long as it wasn't something that concerned her safety, there wasn't really anything in the Great Wu Dynasty that could make her angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Matriarch He’s words had piqued her curiosity. "Grandmother, please speak freely. Granddaughter-in-Law isn't so petty as to get angry."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch paused for a moment, as if she didn’t believe Chu Lian’s reassurance. When she did speak, it was with some degree of guilt. "Alright, my child. Grandmother will tell you now. Sanlang has gone off to the northern border to join the army. He left this morning before dawn."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian froze; she hadn't expected that at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wait a minute, something was wrong here... How could that be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The novel's He Changdi had never thought of joining the army. This could be seen from how he had never taken up any official post despite growing up in a military official's family. How... how could he have gone off to join the army now?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did it seem like the story was changing? He Sanlang was completely ignoring the novel's original plotline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If everyone in the room right now could see what Chu Lian was thinking, they would surely roll their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As He Sanlang's young, newlywed wife, wasn’t your focus a little off, Chu Lian?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shouldn't you be trying to think of why your husband would abandon his newlywed wife to join the army, rather than worry about how the current events didn’t match the original fiction?</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a good several moments, Chu Lian was completely preoccupied with her thoughts. Seen through the eyes of the He Family, it looked like she was at a loss for what to do. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch’s heart ached even more for her grandaughter-in-law. "Don't be sad, child. You still have your eldest brother, eldest sister-in-law, and second brother and Grandmother here!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>To the others, Chu Lian looked like a lost lamb utterly shattered by the news, but only she knew what she was thinking inside her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was secretly raging at He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like that guy was hell bent on separating from her. After eating her cooking, he had actually just upped and left! He had such a pretty face, but what a pity that his personality was so terrible! Now that this had come about, she wanted to wait and see what he was going to get up to at the northern border! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the two of them couldn't be friends, then they might as well cut all ties!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't like she couldn't live without him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, it was a good thing that he was gone. Now she could live freely at the Jing'an Estate without anyone interfering or disturbing her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn't take it to heart at all. If it hadn't been for the novel's description of He Changdi's excellent personality, she wouldn't have held any expectations towards him at all. Now that all those expectations had already fallen short, she didn't have any hopes for He Sanlang anymore. There was nothing to be sad about for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian smiled. "Grandmother, I know you're all here for me. Even if Husband isn't here, I'll continue living well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her genuine smile seemed like a fake one to mask her sadness. Even the usually inconsiderate He Changjue spoke up. "Sister-in-Law, please don't be sad. I'm working in the Left Military Guards. The moment there's any news about my brother, I'll bring it back to Sister-in-Law."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Chu Lian passed her morning accepting comfort from her family. Matriarch He even specially gifted her with a jade ornament inlaid with gold to comfort her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of the ornament, it must be worth at least a thousand taels.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>TL Note:&nbsp;</strong>All the people who were waiting for Sanlang to leave, it's time to party~ XD</p>
 <p>Chu Lian's solo life and money-making starts here~ We'll still get to see Sanlang's side of the story from time to time, as well as the continued hilarious interactions between our lead couple. We'll make that silly Sanlang kneel 1000x to our sweet Chu Lian before he's allowed to have her, but...&nbsp;There. Will. Be. Romance!</p>
