 <p><strong>Chapter 658: Playing Pitiful (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing narrated what she had seen in full detail to Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sat by the bed, a little stunned. The dim yellow candle light shone on the side of her face, making her small face seem even paler.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Wenqing didn’t hear any reply from Chu Lian, she had to probe again, “Third Young Madam, what should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sighed softly. “Wenqing, take him to the opposite room and have Wenlan get him a clean set of clothes. Okay, I’m going to sleep now; don’t disturb me unless it’s for something important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing felt a burst of joy inside. Although the majority of the blame for the couple’s fight fell upon Third Young Master this time and she wanted to get justice for Third Young Madam as well, the men were still the ones who held the power in the Great Wu Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the relationship between husband and wife deteriorated, Chu Lian would always be on the losing side as the wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing personally went out and conveyed Chu Lian’s words to Third Young Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, He Changdi managed to smoothly enter the courtyard smoothly. He changed into clean, dry clothes in the room beside Chu Lian’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to go take a look at Chu Lian, but Wenlan informed him that Third Young Madam had already gone to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, the lights were still on in Royal Princess Duanjia’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A maidservant was standing beside her and softly reporting something to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she heard all of it, Royal Princess Duanjia pouted and gestured for the maid to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was the only one left inside the room, a tall and burly figure appeared from behind a screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue walked over to the table and sat down. “Third Brother and Third Sister-in-Law have always had a good relationship; why are they suddenly fighting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes without any care for her image. “Honestly, your brother’s heart is like a blob of corniness. Getting soaked in the rain? He obviously did that on purpose! That silly Chu Liu would probably let everything go after he coaxes her a little.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue awkwardly coughed. “Sanlang isn’t as bad as you think. He just really loves his wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit! Who even shows their love for their wife like this? And is he blind or something? He’s been so close to that damned brat Leyao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue stiffened up as he was unable to refute that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia suddenly turned her head and glared at He Changjue. She pointed her finger right in his face and proclaimed, “If you dare to treat me like this in the future, I’ll immediately divorce you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue’s face turned black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day, everyone was preparing to return to the capital early in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As He Changdi had to stay by the emperor’s side as a guard, he had already gotten up before dawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he left, he stood in front of Chu Lian’s window for fifteen minutes, finally leaving while suppressing his coughs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian got up, He Changdi was already long gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She endured the urge to ask about He Changdi’s condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her complexion seemed to have greatly improved after a proper night’s rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once everything was packed, they boarded the carriage. Only an hour through the journey back to the capital, someone knocked on the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan raised the curtain of the carriage. Seeing the person outside, she greeted, “Good morning, General Sima. Have you come to look for our Third Young Madam?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sima Hui was riding on a snow-white horse. Looking incredibly suave in her martial attire, she nodded towards Wenlan with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few moments later, Wenqing and Wenlan stepped off the carriage and got onto horses instead, leaving the space in the carriage for Chu Lian and Sima Hui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Sima Hui entered, she looked around the spacious carriage and even touched the decor. A smile surfaced on her lips as she said, “As expected of the imperial family’s carriage. If I hadn’t known beforehand, I would have thought that the person riding in here was a prince or princess!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gave her a look of disdain. “This is a carriage granted by the emperor himself; of course it would be high-quality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sima Hui laughed. “That’s where you’re wrong! The one that Xiao Bojian is riding in isn’t as good as this one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister Hui, have you come here just to make fun of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, I’ll stop joking with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Sima Hui’s serious expression, Chu Lian set aside the smile on her face. With clear eyes and a slight frown, she asked, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sima Hui sat right next to her, awkwardly clearing her throat before asking, “Lian’er, just what happened between you and He Sanlang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian: … </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Chu Lian truly wished that she could find a hole and bury her head inside it. Why was it that this insignificant matter between her and her husband was known to everyone around them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After coming to her tent for a free meal on the first day, Sima Hui had stayed by the emperor’s side with the other military officials. The two hadn’t even seen each other until now, yet Sima Hui had still caught wind of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Chu Lian’s mouth twitched. Only one possibility came to mind. “Was it Fourth Prince who told you about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Jin was the lunatic He Changdi’s best friend. If he needed to confide in someone about this, Prince Jin would be his first choice.</span></p>
