 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 388: Captured (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian quickly agreed to Sima Hui’s request and told her to hurry to the frontlines. It wouldn’t be good if she wasted too much time here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The originally quiet camp was now in complete chaos. Bugle horns sounded loudly, one after another. Everyone started preparing for battle. The sounds of hoofbeats and the soldiers’ bugle calls blended into a mess of noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Chu Lian was staying put in her tent, she could still feel the tension in the air outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan had similar expressions of anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Young Madam, what should we do?” Wenlan asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s almond-shaped eyes were fixed on the tent flap, which had lifted a little from the winds outside. “We’ll stay in this camp. They’re still preparing for battle out on the frontlines. There’s nowhere safer in the whole of Liangzhou City than the back of the main camp now. Furthermore, General Sima Hui left some soldiers behind to guard us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing nodded upon hearing this. The two maidservants could only try their best to keep their anxiety under control for now. However, just in case, Wenqing went out to call the Li siblings over. The few of them discussed how they should guard Chu Lian’s tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian no longer had the mood to continue reading her book. The Tuhuns had clearly chosen to stall and wait out the winter, and it had seemed like there would still be another month before they would take any action. They were hidden in the snowy mountains and they had enough provisions to outlast the northern border troops. Furthermore, the Tuhuns’ bodies were much hardier and more resistant to the cold, unlike those of the people of the Great Wu Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why had they chosen to mount an attack so suddenly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes narrowed. She thought of the current situation that the border troops were in. There was only one possibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an informant in their ranks!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only ones who knew about the snowboat were Great General Qian’s trusted subordinates. Even Sima Hui hadn’t known what He Changdi had been sent out to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the only suspects were General Qian’s most trusted officers…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shivers went down Chu Lian’s back when her thoughts led up to that conclusion. The border troops were already in a dangerous situation, but now there were informants amongst them. If Great General Qian failed to handle this situation properly, then the army would probably fall apart even before He Changdi returned with the supplies!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Wenqing noticed that Chu Lian’s face had been drained of all colour, she suffered a fright. “Third Young Madam, what happened to you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian waved her hand. “It’s nothing, I’ll be fine after a short rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After carefully thinking the situation over, Chu Lian felt that she couldn’t stand by without doing anything. She ordered Wenqing to fetch her brush and ink; she was going to write a letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifteen minutes later, the letter was done. Chu Lian quickly sealed it in an envelope and summoned Li Xing, who had been guarding the tent outside. She told him to take a snowboat and head straight to Su City immediately. He was to send the letter directly to He Changdi, as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Li Xing didn’t know what was contained inside the letter, he didn’t dare to tarry even a moment longer. His mission was to obey Chu Lian’s orders, so no matter how strange the task, he wouldn’t complain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time dusk fell, more than half of the soldiers had already left. They left behind the camp’s flags hoisted high upon their poles, billowing in the cold winds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in Sima Hui’s female barracks, only a single group of soldiers was left behind to look after the camp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the final trace of sunlight disappeared over the horizon, light snow started falling from the skies, covering the tents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t know what was wrong with her today. A sense of acute unease fell heavy upon her heart. Although it was already dark outside, she didn’t feel sleepy at all. She began to order Wenqing and Wenlan to pack things up, as if that would help her forget her worries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan knew that their mistress was feeling uneasy, so they didn’t complain. They followed her orders obediently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan had already prepared themselves. If the border troops failed to defend the border, they would take Third Young Madam with them and escape. Thus, they would need to have all of their supplies ready to go if the time came. Getting ordered to pack things up was in line with their plans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, there was a burst of noise from outside the camp. The three ladies strained their ears to listen and heard a female voice say, “Honoured Lady, this subordinate has something to report.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian let out a sigh of relief. She recognised that voice; it was one of the female soldiers who usually guarded her tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tent flap was lifted and the female soldier entered the tent. The inside of the tent was illuminated with faint lamplight, making their surroundings rather dim. The female soldier’s head was lowered and her features were hidden by shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She panted for breath as she said with great urgency, “Honoured Lady, this subordinate just received news that Manager Qin’s tent has been attacked!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s expression immediately changed. Manager Qin had been attacked!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was where they were storing all of their supplies!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her worry, she didn’t think further and ordered, “Wenqing, take Li Yue with you and go over there immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing sounded off her acknowledgement. She picked up a weapon and her cloak before quickly following the female soldier out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stared at the fluttering tent flap in a daze. Suddenly, her whole body stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mind replayed the moment that the female soldier had turned to leave the tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder she had felt that something wasn’t right. Her shoes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That female soldier had been wearing leather boots with flexible soles!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the harsh climate of the north and their duties on the battlefield, the female soldiers wore out their boots very quickly. For Great General Qian’s soldiers, as well as Sima Hui’s female soldiers, all of them wore warm boots with thick soles. The front of the boots were even covered with steel to serve as another weapon on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although those thick boots were durable and very practical, they were heavier than the normal type of boots. Furthermore, the steel covering ensured the soldiers could never sneak around; each of their footfalls made light thunks wherever they went.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the female soldier who had just come in, her feet hadn’t made any sound at all, and she had been wearing light boots more suitable for trekking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian grabbed hold of Wenlan’s hand with a grave expression. “Wenlan, we’ve been tricked! Hurry, pack up our things; we have to escape right now!”</span></p>
