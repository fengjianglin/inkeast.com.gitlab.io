 <p><strong>Chapter 60:&nbsp;Abandoning His Wife and Entering the Army (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you hear me?" He Changdi turned the full force of his gaze onto Laiyue, who froze. The poor manservant replied in agreement and left to carry out his orders, though not without a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Halfway to the kitchen, Laiyue still felt uncomfortable. That look from Third Young Master had been like a firebrand; even though he hadn't been able to meet eye-to-eye with that fiery gaze, he still felt tense, as if his skin had been scorched by the encounter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue shook his head helplessly. He couldn't understand how the gentle, refined Third Young Master had suddenly turned into this unreadable, fearsome young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much the servant in the kitchen pled, Laiyue still took away the bowl of snow fungus and lotus seed porridge sitting on the stove and brought it to the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he brought it to He Sanlang and lifted the porcelain cover, the refreshing, delicious scent of lotus seeds drifted up. The porridge had been cooked until the rice grains were thin and sticky, while the snow fungus had turned translucent. There was no trace of the thick flavour of meat in the porridge; instead, there were plump, cute lotus seeds mixed in with the grains. Anyone’s appetite would have been awakened by the mere sight of it. This kind of porridge really suited the current hot summer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue couldn't resist gulping as he watched from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang, on the other hand, inwardly snorted at the dish’s presentation. How had he missed this in his previous life? That wicked woman really knew how to eat well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Serve a bowl for me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue scooped some porridge into a small celadon bowl and placed it in front of He Sanlang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without another word, He Sanlang dug in with his spoon, scooping some porridge into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soft, sticky, fragrant and sweet, it was simple and refreshing to the taste, exactly like its scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since He Sanlang hadn't said anything, Laiyue stood by his side and didn't dare to move away. He watched as his reserved master, who usually didn't have much of an appetite, gulp down bowl after bowl of that snow fungus and lotus seed porridge without any hint of stopping...</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time He Changdi put down his personal bowl, there was nothing left in the original dish that Laiyue had brought to the study. Not even a single grain remained...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue's mouth twitched and he lowered his head. He didn't dare to make a single sound and quietly took the bowls away from the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he stood outside, Laiyue looked at the empty bowls and shook his head regretfully. It must’ve been delicious, based on the way Young Master had been so heartily eating. What a pity that Young Master hadn't missed a single drop; otherwise, maybe Laiyue could have had a taste of it too. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With food in his stomach, especially since it was something that Chu Lian had prepared for herself as next morning’s breakfast, He Sanlang's tense mood immediately relaxed into something lighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought of how that wicked woman would wake up to find that the porridge she had worked so hard to make was gone, he felt positively elated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now filled with energy, he read some military strategy books for two more hours before he finally washed up and went to bed with a light heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in the kitchen, when the servant assigned to watch the porridge saw that Third Young Master's personal manservant had forcefully taken it away, she hurriedly ran to report to Senior Servant Gui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui nodded and sent the servant back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, the moment Chu Lian woke up, Senior Servant Gui reported the matter to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's mouth wordlessly twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conversely, it was Senior Servant Gui who filled in Chu Lian's thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She picked out a hairpin made with kingfisher feathers and inserted it into Chu Lian's hair. Senior Servant Gui smiled as she said, "Third Young Madam, you must have left that porridge out for Third Young Master on purpose!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting exposed, Chu Lian's cheeks reddened as she blushed. She pouted. "Who would leave something out for that guy to eat? Didn't he eat before coming back?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui smiled and stopped speaking, understanding that the young lady was too shy to admit it.</span></p>
