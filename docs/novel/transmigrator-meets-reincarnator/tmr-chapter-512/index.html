 <p><strong>Chapter 512: Mutual Divorce (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this time that He Sanlang stood up. “Grandmother, leave it to me to investigate this matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He looked at her youngest, most accomplished grandson first before glancing at the frowning He Changqi. She brooded over it for a moment before saying, “This concerns the bloodline of our He Family, so I’ll let the two of you handle it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The brothers agreed in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the morning interrogation was concluded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He ordered everyone to return to their respective courtyards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Off in the side room next to the parlour of Qingxi Hall, Muxiang was listening to a maidservant’s report. There was a stormy expression on her pretty face. After the maidservant left, she took up the teapot on the small table beside her and smashed it on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The freshly brewed hot tea scattered all over the patterned carpet, soaking a large portion of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hands tightened into fists, reflecting the fury in her heart. She never would have thought that her meticulously planned trap would be solved so easily by Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who exactly was that woman occupying her original body?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou returned to her own courtyard in a state of confused panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao had a cup of tea ready for her master, but Madam Zou pushed it away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao had no choice but to put the sencha aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She attempted to comfort Madam Zou by saying, “Eldest Young Madam, you must not panic at this time. Please don’t worry. The investigation hasn’t come upon any leads that would point to us and I’ve already taken care of that maidservant. Even if Eldest Young Master and Third Young Master suspect you, as long as you deny it, what can they do to you since they won’t be able to find any evidence?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The panic that had flooded Madam Zou’s mind completely dissipated when she heard Senior Servant Qiao’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She grabbed onto Senior Servant Qiao’s arm. Her voice became much calmer as she said, “Yes, </span><i><span style>momo</span></i><span style>, you’re right. Even if they start investigating us, they won’t be able to do anything as long as we deny it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao nodded. “That’s right. Eldest Young Madam, we can’t panic and make a mistake at such a crucial time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after they finished talking, there was a burst of commotion from the outer room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou twitched as her body tensed from a sudden rush of fear. She turned her head and looked at Senior Servant Qiao. Senior Servant Qiao frowned and patted Madam Zou’s hand to placate her. “Eldest Young Madam, please take a rest first. This old servant will go out to see what happened. Those brats are becoming more and more undisciplined.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou nodded her head wearily and leaned back on the soft lounge to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao lifted the curtains, only to see Jinshui kneeling in the middle of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was apparent that Jinshui had already been punished. There were bloodstains on both her hands and arms and she was crying as she laid sprawled on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao’s heart thumped in alarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a stiff motion, she raised her head to look towards the seats at the head of the room, where she was greeted with the sight of He Changqi and He Changdi. They were both looking down at her with ice-cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two brothers who normally looked nothing alike now carried the same icy glint within their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Servant Qiao, bring Eldest Young Madam out here!” Despite the pleasant, husky tones of He Changdi’s voice, his words sounded like a death knell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao’s entire body turned to jelly. If she hadn’t been leaning against the doorframe, she would have hit the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite her experience with these sorts of situations, she wasn’t able to remain calm when it came to facing these two brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice she let out was shaky. “Eldest Young Master, Third Young Master, Eldest Young Madam, she… she just settled down to rest… If you need anything, just… just let this old servant know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She still dares to rest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The temper of the normally calm He Changqi was out in full force now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had been disappointed with his wife, he had thought to make the best of it and just continue living in this way. However, Madam Zou had actually done something so despicable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had plotted to kill his child and placed the blame on her sister-in-law. What a ‘clever’ lady-in-charge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao could tell with one glance that the current situation was really bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glared fiercely at Jinshui, who was still prone on the ground. With a loud roar, she jumped on the hapless handmaid and started beating her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You little bitch! What did you say to Eldest Young Master and Third Young Master! You caused a misunderstanding between them and Eldest Young Madam! You’re a bitch who betrayed your own master. I’m going to beat you to death today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao instantly turned into a madwoman. She held Jinshui up and started to pummel her brutally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her actions were so sudden that even He Changdi and He Changqi didn’t manage to stop her in time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinshui had already received punishment from the brothers and was lying on the ground half-dead. She didn’t have any strength to resist Senior Servant Qiao, so she received several heavy blows full-on. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, Laiyue swiftly ordered the guards beside him to separate them. If not, Senior Servant Qiao would really have beaten Jinshui to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinshui coughed several times in pain. When she finally recovered a little, she sent a wrathful glare at Senior Servant Qiao. “You’re trying to kill me to get rid of all the witnesses! I’m not going to let you have your way! I’m telling you now, even if I die, I’m going to drag both of you down with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao’s expression changed. She knew that their plan had failed because she hadn’t succeeded in silencing Jinshui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hair was in a mess because of the fight just now. Several strands had fallen out of her bun and now covered half of her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the cover of her hair, various emotions flashed over her face. In the end, she gritted her teeth as if she had finally made a decision. She turned around and hugged He Changqi’s leg, wailing loudly, “Eldest Young Master, this old servant was responsible for everything. It has nothing to do with Eldest Young Madam. This old servant came up with the idea while blinded by greed. It was also this old servant who schemed against Third Young Madam. You and Eldest Young Madam have been married for so many years, so you should understand her personality. Although she’s competitive, she’s not calculating in the slightest. She wouldn’t dare conspire to harm the bloodline!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Qiao was choking on her sobs as she said, “It’s this servant who couldn’t stand it anymore. This servant planned everything because this servant didn’t want Eldest Young Madam to continue suffering from injustice. This old servant is Eldest Young Madam’s nursemaid. Eldest Young Madam didn’t say anything because she wanted to protect this servant. Eldest Young Master, please consider the many years of affection as husband and wife between you and Eldest Young Madam, as well as Little An and Little Lin, and spare Eldest Young Madam this time!”</span></p>
