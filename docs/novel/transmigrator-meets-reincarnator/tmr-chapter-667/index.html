 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 667: Heartless (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>House Ying had not completely fallen out of noble society up till now purely because of the strenuous efforts of Old Duke Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a sad story. Although House Ying was large in number, there weren’t many who were actually capable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Chu Lian’s ‘father’ Chu Qizheng was considered one of the better ones in the family, so the abilities of the rest went without saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Old Duchess Ying was full of wariness and vigilance. She wasn’t willing to use funds to prop up other branches of the family that had more potential. This made the rest of their clan very unhappy with House Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused a vicious cycle within the family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, when a rare promising young seed had popped up from amongst Old Duke Ying’s disciples, they hadn’t been able to catch hold of Xiao Bojian either. Now it was too late even if Old Duke Ying tried to force Xiao Bojian into the family himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the emperor’s imperial decree reached the Ying Estate, none of the members of House Ying felt sad or shocked. Conversely, they were all extremely elated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bestowed marriage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, it was the emperor himself who had personally decreed it. The groom was even a royal prince, a true member of the imperial family. Although there seemed to be something wrong with his mind, it wouldn’t affect his standing due to his birth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as Miss Yuan married him, she would become a third-ranked Royal Princess by marriage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was an honour that most of the Chu family ladies wouldn’t even be able to beg for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Chu Lian’s own marriage couldn’t compare to that honour!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the Ying Estate was beaming with joy. Even the stewards started ordering the servants to decorate the estate and make it seem more festive and harmonious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Old Duchess Ying was chuckling. She praised Miss Yuan for being lucky in front of all the other ladies of the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second branch was even looked upon more favourably due to this engagement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only ones who had faces full of worry and despair were likely Second Madam and Eighth Miss Yuan now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Yuan was sprawled across Second Madam’s lap. She had already cried until she was all out of breath. Sobbing, she begged, “Mother, I don’t want to marry that idiot! Mother, I’m not going to marry him! Please, help me think of a way out! The one I like is Brother Xiao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Madam’s eyes were red and swollen. Miss Yuan was her only daughter, her very lifeline. The others in the estate had been blinded by riches and status. None of them were truly concerned for her daughter’s plight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than his birthright, there was nothing about Royal Prince Shou that could compare to even the most common man!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could she just watch as her daughter’s life was ruined?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stroked her daughter’s messy hair and said, “Yuan’er, don’t panic. When your father returns, Mother will ask your father to intervene. Your father has an official position and he has many connections. Even that Lord Pan has some relation to him. Mother will definitely get your father to think of a way so you won’t have to marry that half-wit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right as mother and daughter were huddling together and crying, Chu Qizheng returned to the second branch’s courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His entire being seemed dull and lifeless. He had lost his high spirits and his eyes seemed soulless. Hidden in his sleeves, he was still gripping the official document that had caused his daze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face seemed to have aged a decade since that same morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The menial maidservant who was sweeping the courtyard came over to greet him with a smile. She even tried to get a bonus by congratulating him. “This servant congratulates Second Master, Second Madam, and Eighth Miss on the good news!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng’s face immediately contorted into a monstrous expression, veins popping out on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maidservant stood frozen on the spot for a moment. When she finally processed what happened, her face paled and she scrambled away in fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng returned to his room, cloaked in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another maidservant greeted him at the entrance, but Chu Qizheng didn’t even say a word in return. He simply strode right into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the bedroom, Second Madam was still comforting Miss Yuan with a hug. When Second Madam saw that her husband had returned, she immediately patted her daughter on the back and stood up to welcome him. Then, she lead in with a complaint. “Dear, you have to help Yuan’er, otherwise her entire life will be ruined!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rumours about the foolish Royal Prince Shou had already spread all over the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of life could a lady expect by marrying a fool? It wasn’t even guaranteed that they might be able to have children!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Madam had been completely shocked out of her wits by her daughter’s sudden engagement. Adding on to that her own urgency, she hadn’t noticed the stormy expression on Chu Qizheng’s face when he entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qizheng was already immersed in his own troubles. His wife’s complaint only added on to the mountain of frustration in his heart and acted as the spark that lit his rage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In a burst of temper, he forcefully shoved his wife aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he hadn’t learned martial arts, he was still a tall man, and he had put enough force into his action that, with a single move, he actually managed to push Second Madam off her feet and onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Madam hadn’t expected such a violent reply from Chu Qizheng. She laid sprawled over the carpet in the bedroom where she had landed, eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at Chu Qizheng. She clearly hadn’t recovered from the physical and mental blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with becoming a Royal Princess? If not for the imperial decree, could Miss Yuan even hope to marry into a prince’s family?” Chu Qizheng’s voice was both cold and heartless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words pierced like needles into the hearts of Second Madam and Chu Yuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both mother and daughter had their eyes wide in shock, especially Chu Yuan. At that moment, she even suspected whether the cold middle-aged man before her was truly her father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her father had always spoiled her and protected her. Whatever she wanted, her father would always do his best to get it for her. However, the man before her had suddenly told her to marry a fool!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father!” Miss Yuan let out a heart-rending wail.</span></p>
