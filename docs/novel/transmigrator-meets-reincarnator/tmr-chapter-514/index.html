 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 514: Finances (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eunuch Wei didn’t dare to reply. After serving the Chengping Emperor for so many years, he understood that the Emperor wasn’t actually trying to ask him for advice. The Emperor had likely already come to a decision in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The question was entirely rhetorical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, after a few minutes, the Emperor ordered, “Call Yang Yanfeng in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Your Majesty, this servant will go immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the whole fiasco with Miaozhen, everyone- including Dalang, Matriarch He, and Countess Jing’an- were in agreement with the main branch’s divorce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day, House Jing’an sent a notice to House Dingyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already prepared the divorce papers with the relevant authorities the day before. The only step remaining was for Madam Zou to pack up her dowry and leave the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou was the eldest daughter of the second branch of House Dingyuan. While she was a true noble lady, old Marquis Dingyuan was already getting on in his age and the main branch of House Dingyuan was in charge now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once old Marquis Dingyuan passed on and the main branch succeeded the title of marquis, the second branch would be cast out of the estate. The second branch’s influence would only deteriorate from then on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was now trusted by the Emperor and he held the title of marquis. The second branch of House Dingyuan could no longer match up to House Jing’an.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Madam Zou had been divorced, the second branch of House Dingyuan didn’t dare to make any comments. Furthermore, this had all been Madam Zou’s own doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As much as Madam Zou’s mother wanted to reprimand her daughter, since she had already gotten divorced by her husband, there was nothing else to say!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she couldn’t do anything to her daughter, Madam Zou’s mother, the Second Madam of House Dingyuan, could only help her daughter pack up her dowry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily her daughter hadn’t been a complete idiot. After so many years, her dowry hadn’t decreased one bit. Conversely, it had actually grown much larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou had been in charge of the household for so many years. Of course she had dipped her hands into the public funds from time to time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Madam Zou’s dowry had been taken out from the storehouses, the amount of silver as well as the properties belonging to the estate had actually been halved!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou took her divorce papers and returned home to the Dingyuan Estate with Second Madam richer than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While this was what the He Family had agreed on, there wasn’t any hint of a smile on Matriarch He’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the warm room of Qingxi Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He sat on the hearth bed. Although it was already early spring, the winter chill still hung in the air in the capital. Matriarch He’s body was weak to start with, so she couldn’t bear to be out in the cold. The fires warming the hearth bed and the walls had never stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying and her daughter, Pan Nianzhen, were keeping the matriarch company in that room as warm as spring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen was squatting by the matriarch’s side and kneading her legs while He Ying was flipping through some account books on the other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch’s eyes were slightly shut. She breathed a sigh of comfort before opening her eyes. “You’re getting better at this, Miss Zhen. My old bones are feeling more comfortable thanks to your massage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen bashfully blinked and smiled. “Grandmother, as long as it’s good for your health, I won’t mind serving you like this forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch reached out to stroke Pan Nianzhen’s smooth locks. “Grandmother can’t bear to tire you out so. Alright, your hands must be sore from massaging me for so long. Go and take a rest at the side. There are some new confections on that table that the kitchen sent over this morning. Why don’t you have a taste and see if you like them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s okay, I’ll massage Grandmother for a while longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen’s actions and words had completely won over Matriarch He’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying secretly sent a look at her daughter, indicating that she had done well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of gratitude washed over Matriarch He’s heart. Only her real daughter and granddaughter would treat her so well. They weren’t at all like those granddaughters-in-law she had. Although they had married into this house, they had grown up in other houses after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old woman regrets not bringing the two of you back to the capital earlier. Otherwise, Miss Zhen’s marriage wouldn’t be delayed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen was the same age as Chu Lian and she had turned sixteen over the New Year. Since she hadn’t been engaged yet, it was indeed a little late for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying smiled. “Mother, you don’t have to blame yourself. We’re fine as long as we know that we’re in your heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch feigned an angry glare at her and said, “You silly girl. What are you saying? You should know better at your age! I gave birth to you myself; why would I not have you in my heart?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, when He Ying smiled again, a satisfied glint flashed across her eyes as she lowered her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a short moment, He Ying handed the account book over to Matriarch He. She had a frown on her face as she said, “Mother, take a look at these accounts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He’s health was failing and she didn’t have as much vigour as before. Although the household management rights were in her hands, she hadn’t been able to work on the household at all. Most of the work had been given to her handmaid, Muxiang, while another portion had been handed over to Senior Servant Liu. He Ying was now the one looking over most of the accounts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyesight had become blurry over the past two years, so she couldn’t quite see the fine words on the accounts now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?” Matriarch He took the book and squinted hard. It took her some effort before she could finally see the words clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she read the writing on the book, her eyes widened in shock. “That Madam Zou! I shouldn’t have left her in charge of the household back then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half of the money and properties of the estate had actually been taken away!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was a whole half of the assets under the Jing’an Estate!</span></p>
