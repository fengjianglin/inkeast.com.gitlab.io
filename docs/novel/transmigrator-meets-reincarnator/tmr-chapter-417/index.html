 <p><strong>Chapter 417: Not Stupid (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan was clearly still huffy over the whole matter. Her usual calm and generosity were completely non-existent as she snorted. “So what if it belongs to our Third Young Madam? Our Third Young Madam is the most junior in this family, so she can’t beat the senior family members. See, with one word from Matriarch He, a whole month of profits from our Third Young Madam’s Guilin Restaurant have been confiscated for the public funds! They didn’t even leave &nbsp;a single silver behind!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servants Gui and Zhong were astounded. They hadn’t expected Matriarch He to have done so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, even though it was the matriarch who had ordered this, it was still a little too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guilin Restaurant now belonged to Chu Lian alone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shared sense of foreboding appeared in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong mulled it over before saying, “Tell me, what do you think the matriarch means by this? Is she thinking of taking Guilin Restaurant back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui and Xiyan both sunk into silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments later, Xiyan bit her lower lip and said, “Forget it, Third Young Madam was already prepared for this even before she left. I thought she was overthinking things back then, but now it seems like it’s a real possibility. We can’t just sit back and do nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servants Gui and Zhong looked at Xiyan with amazement. Could it be that Third Young Madam had left some instructions for Xiyan before leaving?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since things had progressed to this stage, there was no need for Xiyan to continue hiding it anymore. Chu Lian trusted Senior Servants Gui and Zhong as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had already considered that a situation like this would happen even before she had left for the north. She had written down some solutions and left them to Xiyan. She instructed Xiyan not to use them until she really had to. Xiyan had never even considered opening that letter before, but now she had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, </span><i><span style>momo</span></i><span style>, did you really think that our Third Young Madam is someone who’s easy to bully?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Xiyan had said so, the two senior servants’ worries turned into smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were speaking in the warm room, a servant from outside reported that Princess Duanjia’s handmaid Jinxiu had come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan’s face lit up with joy and she quickly replied, “Invite her in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three personally went to the entrance to receive her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, Jinxiu was welcomed into the warm room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A servant brought tea over for their guest. When Jinxiu looked at the three servants, her expression changed subtly and she asked, “The three of you seem rather downcast, is there something in the estate that’s troubling you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back when Chu Lian had still been in the capital, she had gotten along the most with Royal Princess Duanjia. She had even saved the princess once. When Chu Lian had left for the north, Princess Wei had even specially sent some guards from her estate to follow along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan and the others were Chu Lian’s most trusted subordinates, so they knew that they didn’t have to hide things from Princess Duanjia’s servant. They explained the situation with Guilin Restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinxiu frowned. Although she was from Prince Wei’s estate, even from the perspective of a bystander, Matriarch He had gone overboard with her actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you require any assistance from our princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan hurriedly shook her head. “How could we trouble the royal princess? Our madam isn’t someone who would let others bully her just like that. Third Young Madam left some solutions for us, so we should be able to work things out by ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinxiu nodded, “Alright, then be careful. We’re all servants here, remember that we don’t have the same immunity as our masters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan put some dried snacks in front of Jinxiu to let her have a taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What have you come over for, Sister Jinxiu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinxiu quickly set down the snacks in her hand and dusted them off. She turned to a lower-ranking maidservant behind her and took a small bag from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was so occupied with chatting that I almost forgot about the task that Princess Wei and Royal Princess entrusted to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinxiu opened up the small bag right in front of the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a few exquisite long boxes and a set of luxurious clothing within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinxiu carefully took out the dress first and explained, “This is a dress made from some silk Sichuan brocade that our princess acquired from Mianzhou. There were only two outfits made in total; one light yellow and this pink one. Honoured Lady has the same measurements as our Royal Princess, so Princess sent me over with one set for Honoured Lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan and the other servants hurriedly accepted the dress and thanked Princess Wei in place of Chu Lian. Even though Chu Lian wasn’t in the capital, Princess Wei was still thinking of her as she was having dresses made for Royal Princess Duanjia. That showed how much Princess Wei favoured Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan, Senior Servant Gui and the rest were genuinely happy for Chu Lian over this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t count on House Ying for any support. Now that Princess Wei had become Chu Lian’s backer, even if Chu Lian distanced herself from her maiden house, the noble madams and ladies of the capital wouldn’t be able to bully her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinxiu then opened several of the pear blossom wood boxes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here is the share of the profits for the jewellery store for this month. Since Honoured Lady isn’t around, you can keep these for Honoured Lady first. The rest of the boxes are all accessories that the master craftsmen of the store have made. These were personally picked out by our Royal Princess for Honoured Lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before leaving the capital, Chu Lian had opened up a jewellery store together with Royal Princess Duanjia. They had agreed on leaving the management of the storefront and personnel to Princess Duanjia, while Chu Lian was in charge of drawing up new and interesting designs for the jewellery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chu Lian had handed over a stack of designs to Royal Princess Duanjia before leaving, the store hadn’t opened that month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t until the start of November that the jewellery store Treasure Pavilion had officially opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time that Chu Lian had received profits from the jewellery store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan, Senior Servant Zhong, and Senior Servant Gui all stared at the thick piles of banknotes inside. They were all slightly dazed from shock. All of this was from just a single month’s earnings?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jinxiu seemed to have guessed at their train of thought. She smiled and explained, “You might be surprised now, but if you go over to Treasure Pavilion and take a look for ourselves, you’ll realise that this much profit is actually on the lower side. It’s almost New Year’s, so all the noble families in the capital are going to come to the store to make new accessories or headdresses. The earnings for the last month of the year should be at least twice as much as the previous month!”</span></p>
