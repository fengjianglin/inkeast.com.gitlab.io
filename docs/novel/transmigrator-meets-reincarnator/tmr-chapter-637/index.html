 <p><strong>Chapter 637: Falling Off Her Horse (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So it was Chu Lian who had made that dish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Princess Leyao gritted her teeth and was instantly overcome with anger towards Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Concubine Wei lightly patted her daughter’s back, then lovingly asked, “Are you feeling better?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Leyao had puked until her face had turned deathly pale, only managing to stop with great difficulty. Around this time, a palace maid delivered a cup of tea. Princess Leyao took a sip from it and felt a little bit better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, does Father hate me now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now calm, Princess Leyao’s eyes reddened. After a few more blinks, her tears began to fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor had very few daughters, and Imperial Princess Leyao was the youngest of them all. Previously, she had been the most pampered princess, and the emperor had never spoke to her harshly. However, now he had suddenly turned his temper on her, all because of a disgusting dish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could the headstrong Princess Leyao accept this?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Concubine Wei saw how red her daughter’s eyes were and quickly rubbed her head to console her. “Yao’er, how could you think that? Your father has always loved you the most. He’s just in a bad mood today, and you got caught up in it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Leyao sniffled, then buried her face in her mother’s soft bosom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Concubine Wei gently caressed her daughter’s smooth hair, but her mind was incredibly tense as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was apparent that she had underestimated the place that that slut Ye Xun held in the emperor’s heart. That girl was merely a lost cause that had crawled out of Ye Xun’s belly, yet the emperor valued her so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Imperial Concubine Wei doted on her daughter, she couldn’t spend all day with her as there was still the afternoon hunt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor would lead his officials to the forest to hunt, so she needed to act as the host for the female guests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, Imperial Concubine Wei hastily left. She bumped into Feudal Princess Anmin at the entrance of the tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anmin, take good care of Leyao. That child is in a bad mood today,” Imperial Concubine Wei said, assigning this task to her before leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feudal Princess Anmin respectfully complied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Imperial Concubine Wei left, Anmin entered the tent to console Imperial Princess Leyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Leyao suddenly made a cry of alarm. Her eyes were blown wide with rage and disbelief. “Cousin, what did you just say?! Chu Lian cooked all the food at Father’s table just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feudal Princess Anmin, who was two years older than Leyao, wore a grave expression as she nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that information in mind, Princess Leyao clenched her teeth. She wished she could put Chu Lian to death right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having been pampered by everyone in the palace, she was used to being arrogant and domineering. The two times when she had had to suffer the emperor’s criticism had both been caused by Chu Lian. Adding on to that her hidden feelings for He Changdi, she truly hated Chu Lian now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, she didn’t know of Chu Lian’s true relationship with the emperor, or she would probably go mad otherwise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh! How can that Chu Lian be so vile!” Princess Leyao was angry and frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feudal Princess Anmin softly sneered and rolled her eyes. “Cousin, why waste your time in hatred? Since you dislike her, just make life difficult for her. We’re ladies of the imperial family; what’s there to fear? Remember Chu Lian’s identity. At best, she might be called Marchioness Anyuan, but at worst, she’s just a child from a third-rate family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Feudal Princess Anmin’s words, Princess Leyao’s eyes shone. “Cousin, do you have an idea that can help me relieve my anger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the afternoon, everyone gathered in the plaza after resting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The plaza was covered in flattened grass and surrounded by a fence of banners. It was clear that the stewards in charge of the hunting grounds had made proper preparations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an open air stable, an exquisite viewing arena, an archery range, a beautifully maintained polo field, and various other facilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor walked at the very front, and personally called out the names of people who were to enter the forest to hunt with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of them were military officials. He Changdi, Royal Prince Lu Tai, Heir Zheng, and some others were named.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Sima Hui, the lady who had never been given a chance to prove herself an equal match to men, was named!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Jin, who had been standing behind the the emperor, suddenly glanced in Sima Hui’s direction. He may have looked at her in a low-key manner, but his gaze carried a subtle warmth and smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sima Hui had been raised like a son. When she heard her name, she stepped out and saluted with a smile. Her actions were natural and open, and there wasn’t any hint of shyness or embarrassment in her gestures, unlike most ladies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her cool action immediately won the eyes and admiration of many young military officials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor announced the names very quickly. It was already mid-day; they still had to hurry back before it got dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, everyone mounted their horses, and they galloped away into the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right as the emperor left, Princess Leyao disregarded the protests of her servants and guards and jumped onto a horse. She pulled on the reins and followed them into the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feudal Princess Anmin hid in an inconspicuous spot, watching with disdain flashing across her eyes. Her lips suddenly widened into a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned towards an unfamiliar palace maid and said, “Did you see that? Tell Sixth Brother that it’s been done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi, He Lin, Captain Guo, and several others had been personally ordered by the emperor to stay by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, practically everyone had already hunted down an animal or two. He Sanlang in particular was doing very well. He showed mastery in archery, and never missed. He had only shot five arrows, but every single one had hit a target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to this, the emperor seemed to look upon him with favour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the forest, an agile doe was moving about. The emperor raised his bow and took aim. Right as he was about to shoot, he heard the voice of a guard beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, something happened!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment of distraction was enough for the doe to escape into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a deep voice, the emperor angrily asked, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard trembled, but remained determined to make the report. “Your Highness, Princess Leyao has followed us. She’s right behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?! This is preposterous!” The emperor’s face instantly transformed from its tranquil state to anger.</span></p>
