 <p><strong>Chapter 412: Looking for Snow Mountain Mists (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Chu Lian obviously wasn’t allowed to go in the end, so she stayed in the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she wasn’t silly enough to just wait around doing nothing. She compiled modern tips and tricks for hiking onto a sheet of paper for He Changdi to take along with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chu Lian had never climbed Mount Everest in her past life, she had tried climbing some other snowy mountains. Furthermore, she had taken the time to take several lessons under a professional coach, so it was obvious that she was more well-trained for mountain climbing than the ancients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang tucked the list of ‘things to note’ away into his clothes. The thin slip of paper felt like a personal heater for his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he looked at the writing and saw how different it was to ‘Chu Lian’s’ writing in his past life, He Changdi didn’t know why he didn’t feel a single shred of alarm. Conversely, the tightly wound nerves in his heart relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The northern border troops had achieved an overwhelming victory over the hundred thousand-strong Tuhun army, and this news only took two days to reach Suzhou City, which was next to Lake Qianshan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suzhou City then passed on the news to the capital, sent out at the highest speed and priority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scourge of the north had been defeated, and it was nearly New Year. If the good news could reach the capital before New Year’s Eve, then the capital’s celebrations would be even more joyous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With their borders safe and their tributary states coming down to pay their respects for New Year, it was a double blessing for the Great Wu Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the news reached Suzhou City, Xiao Bojian was in the middle of drinking some tea inside his tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three men dressed in black were kneeling in the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One stood right next to Xiao Bojian at his usual place. He was trying his best to erase all signs of his presence, afraid that he might provoke his unstable master somehow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian’s cool gaze swept over the three kneeling men. Although his tone seemed normal, the three men knew exactly what he meant when he spoke. They couldn’t help but shiver in fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One, settle this according to our standard procedures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the leader of the secret guards, One, couldn’t hold back a shiver from the unfeeling words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t have any right to plead for mercy for them. He walked up to the three men and stuffed a small brown pill in each person’s mouth so quickly that they couldn’t react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After having the small pill forcefully fed down their throats, the faces of the three men turned deathly pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s your last chance now. You know what will happen if this poison isn’t cured after a month,” One warned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, Xiao Bojian dismissed them with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One took his place at Xiao Bojian’s side again, turning back into an invisible person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only he knew what he felt inside at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just couldn’t understand how a pampered, weak girl like Honoured Lady Jinyi could have escaped from the hands of their deadly operatives. She had also been able to kill the four operatives before escaping… His throat suddenly felt a little dry and cold sweat gathered on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian’s features had always been more feminine. The threatening aura draped around him only emphasised the sinister cast of his face. Now that the northern border troops had won the northern war, there was no longer any need for the northwestern army to continue staying in Suzhou City. He believed the Emperor would recall the northwestern army once he received the news and send them back to their original posts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he would be returning to the capital soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xiao Bojian refused to accept this truth, there was no longer any need to remain in Suzhou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But thinking of Lian’er... Whenever Xiao Bojian thought of how Chu Lian was still by He Changdi’s side, his rage would slip out of his control and he would feel the urge to rip He Changdi to shreds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the clouds hanging over Xiao Bojian’s expression had yet to fade, someone outside the tent had something to report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Returning to his senses, Xiao Bojian hid his emotions and allowed the messenger to enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curtain blocking the entrance was lifted and a low-ranking soldier entered with a letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the utmost respect, the soldier said, “Sir Xiao, you have a letter from the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was One who stepped forward and picked up the letter, handing it to Xiao Bojian with both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian gripped the thin letter with his slender fingers and waved in dismissal at the soldier. The soldier then bowed his head and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xiao Bojian stared at the letter, his brows drew together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He checked both sides of the envelope, but there weren’t any markings at all. If not for the feeling of something inside the envelope, he would have thought that it was empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sneered inside; this was probably a ploy from someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His parents had died when he was young and his clan had fallen into decline. There weren’t that many of them left. The only people he was familiar with in the capital were members of House Ying and his schoolmates. He had already received House Ying’s letter a few days ago, so this couldn’t have been sent by Old Duke Ying. This made the anonymous sender even more of a mystery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After tearing the envelope open, Xiao Bojian found a thin piece of paper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not much was written within; only up to half the paper had been filled. However, just the content alone was enough to make Xiao Bojian’s expression change completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His disdainful expression was instantly wiped clean. Xiao Bojian gripped the paper in his hands hard as his features contorted. After a moment, he actually burst out into loud laughter. The sight was so spine-chilling and fearsome that even One’s body trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mas… Master, is something wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heavens are truly on my side!” Xiao Bojian was already so immersed in the waves of excitement overwhelming him that he didn’t even hear what One said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His upturned eyes were filled with excitement as he gripped the letter in his hand and ordered, “Send some men to Mount Ah-Ming! They must annihilate He Changdi no matter the cost! If they fail the mission, then expect their heads to roll! Send someone to investigate the source of this letter as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One didn’t dare to question his master further and immediately left to carry out his commands.</span></p>
