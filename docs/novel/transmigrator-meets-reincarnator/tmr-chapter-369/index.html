 <p><strong>Chapter 369: Because I'm Lazy (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing noticed that Chu Lian was rubbing her hands together and huffing out her breath to warm them, so she quickly stuffed a new handwarmer into her hands. She hesitated before asking, "Third Young Madam, since you were the one who came up with the idea, why didn't you give the blueprints directly to General Qian?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Wenqing blurted out the question, she immediately realised that it wasn't appropriate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She rushed to try and make up for it. "Third Young Madam, please don't blame this servant. This servant crossed the line. This servant shouldn't have cast doubt on Third Young Madam's decision."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked up just in time to catch the fear that flashed across Wenqing's face. However, instead of getting angry, Chu Lian gave her a bright, yet cunning smile. Her beautiful almond-shaped eyes curved into upturned crescent moons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have nothing to hide from the two of you. If you want to know, I'll just tell you. Of course it's because I'm lazy!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a saying that went something like, 'self-preservation is the first law of nature'. Everyone had moments of selfishness before, where they’d even put themselves above their own partners. After all, wasn’t it sillier not to put your own survival first?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you didn’t even treat yourself well, how could you expect others to do it for you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was nothing wrong about Wenqing's question. If Chu Lian had presented the snowboat to Great General Qian today, then she would have definitely gotten credited for the major contribution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From their understanding of General Qian's personality, if the northern border troops managed to overcome this trial, he would likely push for a promotion for Chu Lian. Even if she didn't mention anything to him, she would most likely rise up another rank or even become a Royal Princess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Lian had gone straight to Third Young Master the moment she had arrived. She had even ordered the men in her party not to reveal that she had been the one to design the snowboat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan had been waiting with bated breath to hear what kind of righteous reason Chu Lian had for doing so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that Third Young Madam's heart was filled with Third Young Master, and that her goal was to become her husband's silent supporter? Or perhaps she wanted to become a hidden hero...? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although there were plenty of hot-blooded reasons, those were completely unrelated to Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had actually revealed without any shame at all that she had just been too lazy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flames burning in Wenqing and Wenlan's eyes instantly went out, extinguished by a basin of ice cold water. There wasn’t even the slightest trace of smoke left...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan's faces turned stiff. The corners of their lips twitched as they tried to think of a reply for their mistress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Young Madam kept mumbling about Third Young Master being a 'lunatic', but from their point of view, Third Young Madam wasn't any better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just take a look at the other noble madams. They fought for their husband's favour all the time, but when their Third Young Master wasn't around the estate, their Third Young Madam lived even more happily than when he was around. Other noble madams cared about their reputation. Their Third Young Madam treated her Honoured Lady title as if it was just for show. Other noble madams loved to dress up. Their Third Young Madam was only occupied with eating... </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan went on a crazy rant in the safety of their own minds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian glanced at her abnormally 'silent' maidservants and noticed that their expressions were quite blank, so she kindly explained further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Think about it. If I were to give the snowboat blueprints directly to General Qian, he would definitely keep me in his tent for questioning. Later on, the rest of the officers would also have to ask me tons of questions..." Following that, it would be having to coordinate the mass production of the snowboats, setting the principles, discussing the usage of the snowboats... </span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she thought of all that had to be done, Chu Lian felt dizzy. Rather than working herself to the bone, why not hand over the tiring stuff to He Sanlang? He would definitely be willing to do it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan: .....</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were a little exasperated by Third Young Madam's reasoning. "Don't you want everyone to see you in a new light, Third Young Madam?" </span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Emperor ever found out about this, he might even praise their Third Young Madam in front of the whole court. That was an honour that most people couldn't even dream about. With that, every time anyone in the capital mentioned Chu Lian, the first thing they would think about wouldn't be how her fertility had caught House Jing'an's eye, but her miraculous invention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone would have to be respectful towards their Third Young Madam so as to not offend the Emperor. That lady from House Dingyuan, Zou Yuanqin, wouldn't have the guts to frame Third Young Madam any longer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stared curiously at Wenqing and Wenlan. She hadn't expected her two maidservants to be so competitive. She found it funny and smiled as she said, "Why do I have to make others see me in a new light? I think that it's good enough for me to eat well and live well. Why do I need approval from others? It's not like I'm living for other people's attention. It's good enough if I'm happy. I like to be comfortable and I don't like to worry about so many things. Let me tell you girls: if you worry too much, you'll age faster!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian reached out to poke Wenqing and Wenlan's foreheads, copying the mannerisms of an elder educating her juniors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan were shocked stiff by Third Young Madam's strange worldview. Their jaws dropped in amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian smiled. "Does this mean that you girls think General Sima is impressive?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan nodded furiously. Of course! General Sima was quite well-known in the army despite her young age. Even they had heard of General Sima during their time in the capital. Any woman who knew a bit of martial arts would admire General Sima!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was the modern 'Hua Mulan'!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the Empress Dowager, who usually remained a recluse in the palace and never talked about court matters, had personally praised Sima Hui at the national banquet and awarded her with a set of custom-made armour.</span></p>
