 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 77:&nbsp;Marquis Dingyuan's Longevity Feast (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He picked up her teacup and took a sip. “Dalang’s wife, it’s your grandfather’s longevity feast tomorrow, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou smiled as she nodded. “It is! Grandmother still remembers such a date! Granddaughter-in-Law thanks Grandmother in place of Grandfather.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Child, you’re being too polite.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While sitting on the other side, Chu Lian hadn’t expected the topic to be diverted to the feast. She tried to shrink into her seat and hide her presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why don’t you guys attend the longevity feast by yourselves? Please, please, please don’t remember to invite me along!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the heavens didn’t listen to her pleas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He suddenly changed the discussion. “Sanlang’s wife has just married into the family, but lately, she’s only spent time alone at home. Why don’t you bring her along with you when the time comes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He would be attending the feast as well, but the old madams had their own circles. It wasn’t suitable for a young lady to join them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Chu Lian was a newlywed and Madam Zou was still young, it would be better for Madam Zou to introduce some of the young madams of the capital to Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s body stiffened. She hadn’t expected Matriarch He to suggest that she follow Madam Zou to the feast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to speak up and reject the offer, but this wasn’t the right time for her to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could only pray silently in her heart. Madam Zou, please don’t agree to it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou was a sweet-tempered person, so she didn’t hesitate as she replied, “Yes, Grandmother. Please don’t worry. I’ll bring Third Sister-in-Law with me tomorrow and take care of her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He nodded in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had just left home, and there hadn’t been any news of him yet. She wanted to help Chu Lian take her mind off her missing husband, so she had made the suggestion to Madam Zou. However, her good intentions had actually caused more trouble instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was suffering inwardly beyond words, but she couldn’t show any of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could only brace herself and agree to the outing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two granddaughters-in-law sat with the matriarch for a while longer before they took their leave to visit their mother-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an’s condition wasn’t too good today. When Chu Lian arrived for her visit, the countess was still asleep. Madam Zou and Chu Lian sat in the outer room for ten minutes before leaving and returning to their respective courtyards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day, Chu Lian was to follow her sister-in-law, Madam Zou, to the Dingyuan Estate for the longevity feast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she woke up in the morning, Senior Servant Gui and Xiyan helped Chu Lian into the dress they had already picked out. Since she was still a newlywed madam, they had chosen a brightly coloured dress. It matched perfectly with the ruby hair ornament Chu Lian had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before leaving Songtao Court, Senior Servant Zhong suddenly coughed once. Chu Lian turned around and gave Senior Servant Zhong a weird look before realisation dawned on her. She then ordered, “Xiyan and Wenqing will serve me at the Dingyuan Estate today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two maidservants obediently agreed. Senior Servant Zhong shot a look at Wenqing. Before they left the courtyard, she even whispered a reminder into Wenqing’s ear. “Remember what I said last night. If you slip up, just wait for your punishment when you return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing nodded fervently. Rest assured, she wouldn’t let any men near Third Young Madam at all. For the sake of her delicious meals, she was going to fight with all her might. Any shameless man who wanted to snatch her Third Young Madam away would be beaten down without mercy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, Senior Servant Zhong wasn’t able to read Wenqing’s thoughts. Otherwise, she probably would have puked up a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Girl, that wasn’t what she instructed you to do last night!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they reached the screen at the entrance of their estate, Chu Lian was invited by Senior Servant Liu to take Matriarch He’s carriage. Madam Zou boarded another carriage with her two daughters, Little An and Little Lin, while her husband, He Dalang, followed next to the carriage on horseback with the guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their party left the Jing’an Estate and made their way towards Marquis Dingyuan’s estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He’s carriage wasn’t very big, but it was comfortable inside. Senior Servant Liu sat by the matriarch while Chu Lian sat opposite them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Liu had a round fan in hand and was gently fanning the matriarch. Matriarch He was wearing a dark purple eight-bolt dress, as well as an emerald green headband embroidered with a pattern for fortune tied around her head. Her white hair was held up by a long hairpin made out of carved jade. She looked like a noble old madam, subtle and dignified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sanlang’s wife, have you visited the Dingyuan Estate before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Matriarch He spoke up, Chu Lian realised why the matriarch had invited her to share her carriage today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch wanted to give her some pointers on the connections between the people of the Dingyuan Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she knew a little about the events of the novel, there was a limit to how much could be conveyed without diverting too much from the plot. She couldn’t possibly know about the relations of every single family in the capital, so she shook her head honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He was very satisfied with her honesty, so she quietly revealed everything she could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>House Dingyuan was Madam Zou’s maiden family. They were flourishing in terms of population, and Madam Zou was Old Marquis Dingyuan’s eldest legitimate granddaughter. Imperial Consort De had come from the Dingyuan Estate, and was Old Marquis Dingyuan’s daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it had been many years since Consort De had entered the palace. She had only given birth to a single daughter, who had unfortunately passed away at the age of five.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Leyao looked quite similar to Consort De’s deceased daughter, so amongst the many princes and princesses in the palace, Consort De’s favourite one was the ten-year-old Leyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time they reached the Dingyuan Estate, Chu Lian had already been given a clear picture of House Dingyuan’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In summary, Marquis Dingyuan was one of the Emperor’s most trusted officials, and they couldn’t afford to offend them...</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Matriarch He noticed the slightly overwhelmed expression on Chu Lian’s face, she smiled and patted Chu Lian’s hand in comfort. “Don’t worry, Grandmother told you all this just to let you understand what’s going on in the Dingyuan Estate. As for the rest, don’t think about it. Just follow your sister-in-law. She’ll take good care of you.”</span></p>
