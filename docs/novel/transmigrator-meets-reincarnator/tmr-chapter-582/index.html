 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had never seen such a thick-skinned and shameless person in her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lantern lights were burning bright in Qingxi Hall, making it as bright as day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the family was gathered in the parlour of Qingxi Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expressions on their faces were all grave and serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sat next to He Changdi, her gaze focused on their eldest brother, He Changqi, who was seated on the main raised platform.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changqi still looked out of it. It was clear he hadn’t recovered from the shock earlier. Although his figure was as large and burly as before, he seemed more like a lone, lost bear right now. The layer of stubble on his chin added to his fragile appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grating sound of Eldest Madam He Ying’s sobs was ringing in everyone’s ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since she had discovered what had happened to He Dalang and Miss Pan, He Ying had been wailing her complaints in the parlour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was acting like a crazy woman, unbefitting of a noble, causing everyone in the estate to look down on her even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He had been awakened in the middle of the night, so her expression wasn’t looking too good. When she heard that something had happened to her granddaughter, she almost keeled right over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, her ears had been filled with the incessant cries of He Ying, turning her Qingxi Hall into a noisy vegetable market.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the servants couldn’t bear to look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an was helped into the parlour by Senior Servant Wang. Her face was as pale as a sheet, alarming Chu Lian, who hurriedly went up to support her other side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Matriarch He saw that Countess Jing’an had arrived, she finally had someone to vent all the fire in her belly on. She slapped the table and roared furiously, “Look at the son you’ve birthed! That monster ruined his very own cousin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an almost collapsed to the floor thanks to the matriarch’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily, there were two people supporting her on either side, or she might have fainted out of anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The normally mild-mannered countess pointed at He Dalang with a trembling finger. Her voice was hoarse with pain as she ordered, “You unfilial son! Kneel down right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Dalang’s eyes were still empty. Upon hearing his mother’s order, he didn’t give out any sound of protest. He simply knelt down in the center of the parlour. His originally straight back was bent over, causing a pang of heartache in those who cared for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shot a look at Senior Servant Wang, and they worked in unison to help Countess Jing’an over to a nearby chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ying kneeled down on the ground and grabbed onto the matriarch’s legs. She wailed, “Mother! You have to do something for Miss Zhen! My poor, innocent daughter! I was still looking for a good marriage for her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen had been taken back to Qingxi Hall by now. She was resting in one of the side rooms near the parlour, with Senior Servant Liu and a few maidservants taking care of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t stopped crying ever since she had returned to Qingxi Hall, no matter how Senior Servant Liu and the maidservants tried to comfort her. Her eyes were already swollen to the size of walnuts. It was clear that she was feeling regret over her actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doubts arose in Senior Servant Liu’s heart upon seeing Pan Nianzhen’s performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She kept a watchful eye on the maidservants by Pan Nianzhen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over in the parlour, He Ying’s plea for help had only darkened the storm on Matriarch He’s face. Although she still felt guilt over her treatment of her daughter, the current situation was like a slap in her face. Thus, she finally spoke harshly towards her daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even so, why didn’t you take proper care of Miss Zhen! Why would she be in the outer court at such a late hour!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch still had her moments of clear wit. She could see that something was wrong with the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though this dynasty was more open-minded, there was an unspoken curfew at night for the ladies. Once the skies turned dark and they finished their dinners, noble ladies would stay in their own rooms. They wouldn’t leave their own courtyards, let alone the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last night, the three He brothers had returned at a very late hour. Why had Pan Nianzhen appeared in the main study of the outer court at that time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The answer to this question would determine whether He Dalang was a victim or a culprit.</span></p>
