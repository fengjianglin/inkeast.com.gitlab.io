 <p><strong>Chapter 608: Without a Cheat (4)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over the past two days, he and his father had purged the entire estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had also gotten to the truth of why his eldest brother He Changqi had suddenly requested to marry Pan Nianzhen, as well as his request to relinquish his position as heir to He Changjue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It turned out that Eldest Madam He Ying and Pan Nianzhen had had a private discussion with He Changqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had told him that he was ruining their family’s reputation with his actions, and that He Ying would spread the entire matter out to society and bring down the name of House Jing’an if he didn’t take Pan Nianzhen as his wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Driven into a corner, He Changqi had made that decision in despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had already discussed with Count Jing’an and come up with a solution. They were going to send He Ying and her daughter off to one of House Jing’an’s rural holdings and keep them there under guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were also going to rotate the servants in Qingxi Hall out so as to prevent any incidents from happening again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that Count Jing’an was back, it was time to bring forward He Changjue’s engagement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Eldest Brother He Changqi had just divorced, there wasn’t a need to find a second wife for him so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Second Brother took a wife, it wouldn’t be good for him to stay in the estate, since he had his own noble title. Why not leave the estate and make their own home a little earlier?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially since his grandmother had something against Chu Lian now, it was better for them to leave the Jing’an Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Matriarch He was still in the dark about his decision. However, He Changdi had no intention of telling his grandmother until they were ready to move out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Sanlang had already made preparations</span><span style>—</span><span style> and so quickly, too</span><span style>—</span><span style> Chu Lian felt reassured. Her smile reached her eyes, turning them into crescents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are we going to live in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Chu Lian had lived in the Great Wu for close to a year, she was still a modern person deep down. She wanted to have her own home with her husband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang had already looked at several courtyards outside in secret. He leaned his head down and smiled. “Shall we go take a look together soon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian happily agreed to it. They didn’t lack money right now, so it would be better to choose an estate that they liked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the gloomy clouds over the He couple had cleared up, there was a storm brewing somewhere else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To the west of the capital, an average-looking carriage stopped outside the walls of an ordinary residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blinds of the entrance of the carriage lifted, and a middle-aged man dressed in grey jumped out. There was a sword hanging at his waist. After exiting the carriage, he respectfully lifted the blinds once again and helped a young man out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man had exquisitely handsome looks. If not for the Adam’s apple on his throat, he would have been beautifully androgynous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One followed behind Xiao Bojian and whispered into his ear, “Master, this is the place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian frowned. He straightened out his clothes before pushing the gates open and entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This small rural residence was built in the most common layout: a main building and two rooms to the east and west. There was a persimmon tree growing in the middle of the yard with a well beside it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian took in the courtyard at a glance and noticed a single green-clothed maidservant guarding the west room’s entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He paused in his footsteps, a glint of loathing flashing across his eyes before he quickly concealed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian strode forth to the west wing with One following behind him, his head bowed. After he pushed the door open and entered the west room, One stood guard outside together with the green-clothed maidservant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not too long later, the sounds of lovemaking resounded from the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman’s voice was unfamiliar, but extremely flirty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One was trained in the martial arts, so his senses were heightened. His brows drew together at the sounds coming from inside, while the maidservant next to him blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, peace returned to the west room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a strong tell-tale smell within the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t much in the way of furniture inside, just a single bed, a table, and two chairs. However, the quality of the furnishings spoke of deliberate and careful placement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two voices, a man’s and a woman’s, could be heard conversing with each other from within the bedchamber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man was Xiao Bojian, of course. His tone carried a hint of ice and gloominess, so it was easy to identify.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman’s voice was soft, sweet and flirtatious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From her voice, one could discern that she wasn’t very young and was already past her twenties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She chuckled and used a single red fingernail to scratch a mark on Xiao Bojian’s pale chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were unexpectedly impressive, Mr Scholar. This madam almost fainted just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian was currently holding a curvy, mature woman in his embrace. Disgust flashed across his eyes again. A corner of his lips lifted and he blew a puff of warm air into the woman’s ear. His palm slid down to the woman’s full bosom and he gave it a hard squeeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it a good thing that I can satisfy you so well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman laughed at his words, her well-rounded body jiggling with the effort. She lifted a leg onto Xiao Bojian’s body and wriggled about seductively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This madam does like your </span><i><span style>impressive</span></i><span style> self~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian suddenly pushed the woman away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about the matter I entrusted to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was finally unable to conceal the iciness of his tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If not for the woman’s presence, he would have immediately jumped into the bathtub and scrubbed himself clean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman let out another wanton chuckle and clung to him once again. She sprawled over Xiao Bojian’s naked back, her hand wandering down his smooth skin, lower and lower…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Xiao, don’t you trust this madam’s work? How will you thank me this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the woman finished speaking, Xiao Bojian felt an important part of his body grasped by a smooth hand.</span></p>
