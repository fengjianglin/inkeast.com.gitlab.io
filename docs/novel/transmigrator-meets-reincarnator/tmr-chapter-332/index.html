 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 332: Naughty Book (3)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pressed down on the mattress with her small hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thin mattress was practically stuck to the bed board. She flipped it over to check the padding within and discovered that it was not made of cotton or fur, but dried grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's brows gathered together in a frown. Such a thin mattress wouldn't be able to keep the body warm at all. If it was spring or autumn, it might still be alright to make do with this mattress, but in this bone-piercingly cold winter...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She remembered that she had specially ordered the servants to send bedding to He Changdi when she was back at the estate. Her gaze landed on Xiao Hongyu's bed. The thick fleece bedding that should have been He Changdi's had somehow been placed on someone else's bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian wasn't so silly as to think He Changdi was getting bullied. The short and plump Xiao Hongyu had been amongst the rescue party back then, too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wondered if Xiao Hongyu had any sort of internal injury that caused him to be more susceptible to the cold. That seemed like a possible explanation for why He Sanlang had given him his own bedding...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian rolled her eyes. That lunatic husband of hers had only ever shown her the cold shoulder, but towards others, he was extremely considerate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that fellow was rather stupid. After giving away all his things, what was he going to use to cover himself? Didn't he know how to buy himself another mattress?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt a momentary lapse of disappointment towards He Sanlang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stood up and wrapped her grey squirrel cloak around her shoulders. The cold air turned her sigh into a white puff of breath. Chu Lian then turned to Wenqing and Wenlan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Have someone bring the big rugs and blankets from my carriage here. Bring some needles and thread, too."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan blinked as she processed the order. In a quick moment, she understood what Chu Lian was going to do, so she hurriedly ran off to fetch the necessary items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan was a practised martial artist, so she was pretty fast on her feet. In just fifteen minutes, she had finished bringing everything over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian took off her cloak and moved the blanket on He Changdi's bed aside in order to pull up the thin bed sheet. There was only an evenly distributed layer of dried grass underneath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was about to move the dried grass away when she noticed a flash of blue. She walked over to it and brushed the grass aside, revealing an indigo purse lying flat on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pulled out the purse from where it had been stuck in a gap between the layers. When she made to shake off the grass still clinging to it, Wenqing remarked, "Isn't that the purse you use to hold your snacks, Third Young Madam?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of Chu Lian's snack purses had been made by the maidservants in Songtao Court, and most of them were plain in colour without much embroidery on them. Wenqing and Wenlan had made quite a few of them too, so they could recognise it with just one glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had recognised it as well. The body of the purse bulged out a little, but it wasn't heavy. The jerky and snacks that had originally been inside were already gone. She undid the string and realised that there was a stack of similar purses placed neatly within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian finished eating all the snacks in a purse, she would normally throw the purse away, just like if they were plastic bags from the modern era. However, He Sanlang had actually kept every single one of them...</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange and indescribable feeling sparked to life within Chu Lian's heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tied up the purse again and put it back where she found it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was about to stand, Chu Lian noticed a book slotted between a gap in the planks of the wooden bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a moment of curiosity, she bent down and fished it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a very thin book, with a cover made of blue leather. The cover itself was bare, and it looked like there was only twenty or so pages in it at most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian found it strange, so she carefully flipped the book open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only when she looked at the first page that Chu Lian finally found some words: 'Pleasures of the World'.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian frowned. That seemed to be the title, but why was it so weird though? There wasn't any author's name written inside, either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she flipped to the next page, Chu Lian finally realised why this book didn't have any information listed on the cover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The page she had flipped to was a crude picture of a half-dressed couple. They were locked in a passionate embrace while lying on a bed next to a half-opened window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian almost puked blood. He... He Sanlang actually read naughty books?! It was such a crudely made one, too...</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she recovered from her shock, Chu Lian continued flipping through the book with a calm expression. It was just twenty or so pages, so she quickly finished her perusing. There wasn't actually much of note inside. The people and scenes were just too cartoonish and unrealistic. Some of them were even contorted into such weird positions that their heads and bodies looked disconnected. Why was He Sanlang hiding a book as lousy as this like it was some kind of treasure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she randomly picked out a porn book from the modern era and gave it to He Sanlang, forget about hiding it under the mattress; wouldn't he dig out a secret vault instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her lunatic husband was way too inexperienced.</span></p>
