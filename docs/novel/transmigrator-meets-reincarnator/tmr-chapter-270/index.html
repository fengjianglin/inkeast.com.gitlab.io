 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 270: War at the Northern Border (1</strong><strong>)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you want to cure Madam's illness once and for all, you need a single medicinal ingredient. However, this ingredient only grows in the high mountains of the extreme north..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The medicinal ingredient that Great Doctor Miao needed was a type of alpine flower. It was also one of the rarest alpine flowers and was called 'Snow Mountain Mists'. It grew only on the peaks of snow-capped mountains and would only bloom at the coldest times of the year. After blooming, it would wither away in just two to three days. To be able to use it in medicine, the flower had to be picked right before it withered, otherwise it would lose all its worth as a medicinal ingredient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was known to grow in the border between the Great Wu Dynasty and the Tuhuns' territory- Mount Ah-Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In another three months, it would be time for the 'Snow Mountain Mists' on Mount Ah-Ming to bloom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This rare ingredient was hard to preserve and there weren't many fields that required the use of it. Most doctors didn't even know of the medicinal uses of this flower, so it was impossible to find it on the market.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Great Doctor Miao had only incidentally found out about its uses during his younger days when he had wandered all over the land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Doctor Miao spoke bluntly to the various members of the He Family gathered in the parlour. The treatment for Countess Jing'an's body couldn't be delayed for too long. Even if he personally helped stabilise her condition, she could only go on like that for another two years. If they couldn't find this 'Snow Mountain Mists' flower within two years, then there would be nothing he could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Great Doctor Miao finished explaining the situation, he left the parlour to write a prescription for Countess Jing'an. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Matriarch He, the eldest son He Changqi, the second son He Changjue, and the newlywed wife of the third son, Chu Lian, were left in the parlour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The joy that had been present on their faces earlier had disappeared. The matriarch's expression was so serious that the wrinkles on her face creased further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian noticed this, her heart ached for the matriarch. She tried to reassured the old lady by saying, "Grandmother, at least there's some hope for Mother now. And it's not as if this type of flower is completely unheard of. Having some hope is better than having none at all, isn't it?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He took in a deep breath and patted Chu Lian's hand. "You're right, Lian'er. At least there's some hope for your mother's illness now. I should be happy instead."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence reigned in the parlour for a while more before He Erlang abruptly stepped forward and knelt before Matriarch He. In a firm voice, he said, "Grandmother, let me go to the north to search for this flower for Mother!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after He Erlang spoke, He Dalang also knelt down in front of Matriarch He. "Grandmother, don't let Erlang go! Erlang hasn't even gotten married yet. I'm the eldest son of this family. When Father left to protect the border, he instructed me to take care of Grandmother, Mother, and my two younger brothers. It's obviously me who should go on this trip to the north!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, Eldest Brother, I'll go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Second Brother, are you going to disobey your older brother? Let me go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>......</span></p>
 <p><span style>The normally harmonious brothers were actually fighting to be the one to go to the northern border. Matriarch He was starting to get a headache from their quarrelling. She slapped the table next to her with a loud bang and said, "Enough! What are you fighting for?!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only then that the two brothers stopped and quieted down. However, none of them stood up and they simply waited for Matriarch He's final verdict.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He massaged her forehead. After a short pause, she heaved a sigh and said, "This old woman knows that you're all filial children. However, Dalang, you hold a position at court. Without the Emperor's permission, you can't abandon your post without a proper reason. Our estate needs you here as well. We can't do without a male master here to hold the fort in such a big estate. And Erlang has just gotten a mission in Zhangzhou. I heard this mission was ordered by the Emperor himself. You can't disobey imperial orders. If you go to the northern border at this time, are you going to willingly deceive the Emperor? So neither of you are allowed to go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>What?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither of them were allowed to go?! But they were the only male members of House Jing'an left in the capital. If neither of them were to go, how could they stop worrying? It was their very own mother who was severely ill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grandmother, you can't! If we don't go, what's going to happen to Mother?" He Dalang and He Erlang asked in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He opened her mouth to speak. She had a troubled expression on her face. Count Jing'an was deeply in love with his wife. If he were to find out about this piece of good news, he would never let the chance go. She also felt very guilty towards this daughter-in-law of hers, and wished for her speedy recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian pressed her lips before reminding all of them, "Grandmother, have you all forgotten about Husband? Why don't you ask Husband to send someone to Mount Ah-Ming to investigate? With Husband around, he'll surely get the job done."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He froze for an instant. She looked at Chu Lian before turning to the two grandsons kneeling before her. She felt that Chu Lian had brought up a good suggestion. After thinking it over, she declared, "Even if you want to go to the northern border, you won't be able to set out in just one or two days. There are too many things to prepare for in the estate. I have to think about it carefully. Lian'er is right, we still have Sanlang at the northern border, so the two of you shouldn't worry too much. Especially you, Erlang. You can't fool around with an imperial mission on your shoulders! Pack up and go back to the Left Military Guards today!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue wanted to protest, but after getting glared at by He Dalang, he could only lower his head and agree to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian escorted Matriarch He back to Qingxi Hall before returning to her own courtyard.</span></p>
