 <p><strong>Chapter 705: Exchange (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian narrowed his fox-like eyes. While he looked to be gratified on the surface, his smile didn’t reach the corners of his eyes. Deep in his gaze was a lake of frost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiao Bojian made his appearance, the tension in Chu Lian’s heart changed instantly to a dead calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared closely at the man before her. Her soft voice had morphed into a hard and tough one, “State your terms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian started a little, he hadn’t thought that Chu Lian would get right to the point. He was slightly unhappy with how Chu Lian had caught him off guard. He was even more discontent with how Chu Lian had been tense and cautious ever since she had caught sight of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lian’er, I haven’t seen you in so long. Can’t I just come over to meet you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beautiful man kept his voice soft and low. Others might even think that Xiao Bojian was currently whispering sweet nothings to his lover, when he was actually brandishing a blade in threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stared at him with her lips pressed together. She completely ignored his lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last traces of a smile faded from Xiao Bojian’s face, leaving behind a cold mien.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve only come to help Lian’er out, I don’t have any bad intentions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian snorted inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did Xiao Bojian think she was blind?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Stone’s life was in his hands right now. How could that be any good intention?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put down the child and the nursemaid. I’ll go with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Astonishment showed briefly in Xiao Bojian’s eyes. He hadn’t expected Chu Lian to agree without any word of protest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked at him seriously, her resolution clear in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From meeting her gaze, Xiao Bojian understood that her decision was firm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since time was of the essence, and Xiao Bojian didn’t have the time to continue bantering with Chu Lian, he waved at the person next to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-cald man holding the nursemaid moved forward two steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stepped out from behind Wenqing’s back. Wenlan caught hold of her and said anxiously, “Madam! You can’t ignore your own safety and put yourself in danger! If you go, how are we going to face Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned and smiled faintly at the two sisters. She gave them her last order, “Take care of Little Stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan had been serving Chu Lian for so long that they understood her personality well. They knew that Chu Lian couldn’t change her mind once she had decided it. Hearing this, they could only nod and allow Chu Lian to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, this was the only way they could save the young heir at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian had brought all of his assassins along with him today. The guards that He Changdi had left behind weren’t their match at all. Even if they fought to the death, they likely wouldn’t be able to turn the tables around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shot a look at Xiao Bojian to tell him to release the hostages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-clad man looked over at his master, before slowly releasing the nursemaid. Once the nursemaid was off his hands, he instantly turned to capture Chu Lian instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nursemaid carrying Little Stone was immediately pulled by Wenqing, and the maidservant stood in front of the pair to guard them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan watched Xiao Bojian warily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xiao Bojian wasn’t paying attention to them or the young heir any more. He simply turned to look at Chu Lian, whom the black-clad man had brought to this side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile appeared on his face as he said, “Lian’er, you’re looking more and more charming by the day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian met his gaze coolly, “You’re not leaving? If you don’t leave now, it’ll be too late for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faced with such words from Chu Lian, the originally warm expression on Xiao Bojian’s face changed. He let out a cold order, “Go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was carried by two men in black. They quickly left the rural estate and boarded a carriage that had been hidden some distance away. Soon, they disappeared into the darkness of the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Chu Lian had left, Wenqing immediately sent a messenger to He Changdi before leading the rest of the guards out of the estate.</span></p>
