 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi watched as she clung tightly to the corner of the blanket, which was only covering the most important spot on her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything else was practically bared to his gaze. The faint lamp light filtering through the gauzy bed curtains gave her fair skin a lovely glow, enticing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was like a lamb placed on the table for slaughter. The sight soothed He Changdi’s sense of urgency.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his body slightly and stripped off his top. With a trace of humour in his voice, he asked, “How would you like me to spare you, Lian’er?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stared back in a daze. That’s right, how exactly did she want him to spare her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were husband and wife already. This was something inevitable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his hurried actions made her a little afraid and uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian continued clinging to the corner of the blanket. In a soft and coaxing manner, she asked, “How about doing this another day, Husband? We’ve just returned to the capital today, and you even went to the palace. You must be tired. Why don’t we postpone this to… tomorrow? It’s already late; let’s rest for the night!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang held back the urge to burst into laughter. His little kitten was actually trying to escape even at this point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He casually tossed his inner clothes to the floor, revealing the fine lines of his body and his well-defined abs to Chu Lian’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi wasn’t going to let her avoid him forever. He pulled away the blanket in his eyes and whispered huskily into her ear, “Alright, I’ll listen to you. We’ll rest early.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian barely had the time to let out a surprised gasp when He Sanlang pounced on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a few minutes, the couple was intertwined like a pair of mandarin ducks and the sounds of lovemaking resounded in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, as bold and strong as He Sanlang was, he was still a virgin…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple’s first time together was over in less than fifteen minutes...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s face was completely flushed red. Her pleading had landed on deaf ears, so in a last show of temper, she pulled the blanket to her and bit down into it, resisting the foreign waves of pleasure rushing over her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mind was a complete haze. She wailed inwardly, not knowing how long the torture would last. Her body felt like jelly all over and she was on the verge of giving in...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Chu Lian’s first time, so she didn’t get to enjoy much of the pleasure of this conjugal activity. On the other hand, He Sanlang had already become an addict.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Chu Lian was wondering when this would end, she felt a strange sensation in the lower half of her body. Her strong husband froze up and the stiff object inside her softened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither of them had expected their first time to be over so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian slowly opened her eyes, only to be met with a black-faced He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian quickly used up all of her restraint to hold back the urge to laugh. Luckily, she succeeded in her efforts. Otherwise, her lunatic husband might have taken that as a challenge to make her bedridden the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was already over, Chu Lian bore with the soreness in her body and reached out with her wobbly arms to push him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She blinked innocently. Then, in a slightly hoarse voice, she said, “He Sanlang, I’m feeling too sore so I’m going to take a bath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang was still immersed in the shock from the blow of finishing so quickly. Thanks to his momentary lapse, Chu Lian was able to make her escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian quickly scrambled off the bed, bearing with the soreness between her legs. She grabbed the nightclothes by the side of the bed and pulled the robe over her body before running towards the bathroom…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was stumbling a little, she finally made it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian rang the bell to summon Wenqing in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing entered from the servant’s entrance, her head lowered as she waited obediently for Third Young Madam’s orders.</span></p>
