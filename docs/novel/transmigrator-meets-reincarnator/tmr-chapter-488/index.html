 <p><strong>Chapter 488: Fox Fur Capes (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian patted Royal Princess Duanjia’s tiny little hand. “Don’t worry, I’ll teach you how to cook roast duck today. Once you know how, you can make it more often for your father!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia felt a little better from Chu Lian’s assurance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chatting as they walked, they quickly reached the parlour of Princess Wei’s courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei was wearing an elegant silver and red court dress. She was sitting on the warm hearth bed with a gentle expression as she watched Royal Princess Duanjia and Chu Lian enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two young ladies bobbed in greeting to Princess Wei together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Lan quickly stepped forward to help the young ladies up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smiled as she said, “The Princess has been waiting for Honoured Lady to return for some time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei waved Chu Lian over. “Come, come over here quick. Let me take a good look at you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian moved closer, her hands were clasped by Princess Wei’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The princess looked at Chu Lian with a motherly and loving gaze. She inspected her for a bit before exclaiming, “You’ve lost weight! You’re much thinner than you were last winter. We’ll have to get the imperial physician in to check your pulse later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian quickly shook her head. “Princess, there’s no need for that. The doctor in our estate has already done an examination and given me a clean bill of health!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei put on a stern face and disagreed. “Li Yue has already spoken with me. You were injured in the north. Although you had some treatment and the doctor said that the wound has already healed, you can’t guarantee that it has healed all the way. Let’s have the imperial physician look at you anyway, so that this princess can rest easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s heart felt warmed by the princess’s obvious affection for her. She smiled and agreed to it. “Then I’ll have to trouble Princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia pouted. “Chu Liu, see, with you around, Mother forgets that I even exist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei glared at her daughter helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She caught sight of the dress Chu Lian was wearing today and her expression softened even more. “Ah, so the dress fits you perfectly. Duanjia has the exact same measurements!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Lan was similarly happy and began to tease them. “If it isn’t so! Honoured Lady looks beautiful in this dress. Honoured Lady and Royal Princess look like sisters standing together in these matching outfits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since both her mother and Senior Servant Lan had already said so, Royal Princess Duanjia scooted over to Chu Lian’s side and compared their outfits. Even she was surprised as she exclaimed, “That’s true! Chu Liu, you’re as tall as me now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was also mystified by their strong resemblance to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she took a closer look, not only were their figures about the same, even their facial features seemed to be similar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia became even more interested in their appearances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She held Princess Wei’s arm and swung it as she tried to plead coquettishly, “Mother, didn’t you have two brocade dresses made for me recently? Why don’t we change into them for you to see?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei’s eyes lit up at the idea and she quickly nodded in approval.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Royal Princess Duanjia pulled Chu Lian away to her room to change into the new outfits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the two ladies finally returned to the parlour, even Senior Servant Lan was stunned still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young ladies were now wearing two dresses of the same style, one red and one blue. Their hair was put up in the same hairstyles and they had the exact same items all the way down to their accessories. When they held hands and stood before Princess Wei, they looked like real sisters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The impact they gave the onlookers was even greater than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt a little awkward. She had the strange feeling that Princess Wei’s gaze was rather heavy with emotion while looking at her, as if she were not merely her daughter’s friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Lan’s eyes misted over with unshed tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia tugged Chu Lian into spinning around on the spot to show off their dresses before she beamed at Princess Wei and asked, “Mother, don’t we look pretty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei gripped the handkerchief in her hands tightly, restraining the dam of emotions about to break within her. She nodded hurriedly and said, “Yes, of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia walked up to Princess Wei, hand in hand with Chu Lian. She turned to Chu Lian with a mischievous air and said, “See, Chu Liu, I told you that these dresses were pretty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced over Chu Lian from head to toe before wrinkling her nose in dissatisfaction. “You’re so beautiful! You’re wasted on that brat He Sanlang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Princess Wei noticed that her daughter’s mouth was running out of control again, she quickly reached out and tugged on her arm. “Duanjia! What are you saying! He Sanlang was personally named Marquis Anyuan by the Emperor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia rolled her eyes. “So what if he’s a marquis now? He wasn’t able to protect Chu Liu anyway! She got injured out there in the north and she suffered so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei did agree on that point. She thought privately that He Changdi hadn’t taken good care of Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodyguard siblings, Li Xing and Li Yue, had served Chu Lian throughout the whole journey to the north, so Princess Wei knew all the details of what had happened there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this time that Chu Lian spoke up. “Husband came to the estate today and he was invited to the study by Royal Prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she heard Chu Lian’s words, Royal Princess Duanjia looked like she was gloating at someone’s misfortune. “Chu Liu, did you say that my second brother invited He Sanlang to the study?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded, not quite understanding why Royal Princess Duanjia looked so excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! That He Sanlang deserves it! Second Brother loves to play pranks on others!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Tai liked to play pranks?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What a strange pair of siblings! Chu Lian was at a loss for words and she started to worry a little for He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her lunatic husband wouldn’t be so silly as to fall for someone else’s prank, would he?</span></p>
