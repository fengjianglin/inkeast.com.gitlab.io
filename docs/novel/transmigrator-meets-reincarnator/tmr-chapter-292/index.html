 <p><strong>Chapter 292: A Familiar Voice (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi's condition had gotten much better. However, his fever hadn't broken completely, although it was still better than yesterday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard Chu Lian's words, a corner of his lips lifted up. His tone was full of disdain as he replied, "What can a person like you help me with?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned to him with an unhappy frown. "Well, who knows what'll happen in the future! How do you know that I won't be able to help you? I can even help you right now! Wait here, I'll go and find something to eat."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang turned towards the cave entrance. The rain had stopped, and there was a thick layer of snow on top of the dried grass outside the cave. He snorted inwardly. With this sort of bitterly cold weather in the middle of a mountain forest, it was going to be impossible for a weak little girl like Chu Lian to find anything edible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had been watching He Changdi's expression, so she immediately noticed the disbelief and contempt on his face, which provoked her stubborn temper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her cheeks puffed up as she said angrily, "Sit here and don't move! I'll be back soon!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Chu Lian took her big cloak with her as she quickly walked out of the cave. When she reached the entrance, the cold air immediately forced her sleepy mind to wake up all at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somewhat disturbed, Chu Lian shook her head and stomped her foot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What had gotten into her? Why was she so easily provoked by that beardy? He hadn't even really said anything to her and here she was, all ready to go out and look for food by herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now that she had already left the cave, she couldn't just return empty handed. Wouldn't that just make her die of embarrassment?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sighed and tried to calm herself down. She accepted her fate and picked a random direction before trudging off into the woods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking for some time, the scene in the cave played in her mind again. That beardy's voice seemed strangely familiar, as if she had heard it somewhere before. However, she couldn't recall exactly where... </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian shook her head and set that matter aside. There were so many people who looked alike in this world, it wasn’t a surprise if there were people who sounded the same, too. After reassuring herself, Chu Lian stopped thinking about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi watched as Chu Lian's slender figure disappear from sight. Only then did his stiff body untense in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up at the uneven surface of the cave wall, thoughts hidden in the unreadable depths of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after a short moment, he suddenly stood up. Due to his abrupt movement, he felt a wave of dizziness crash over his head, and he couldn’t help but stumble. He Changdi immediately grabbed onto the cave wall for balance and shut his eyes. After resting for a while, his body felt better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although He Sanlang's condition had improved since yesterday, he was still poisoned and feverish. The remaining toxins hadn't been cleared from his system yet, so his body was still weak. Actually, he was in very frail health right now, but when he thought of how Chu Lian had gone into the woods all by herself, he couldn't rest easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who knew if those crafty Tuhuns were still out there in the forest? What if Chu Lian encountered them? Even if there weren't Tuhuns around, the forest was a dangerous place in winter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had risked his life to save Chu Lian's, so if anything happened to her now, wouldn't all his previous efforts go to waste?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s expression was as gloomy as ever. He couldn’t stop thinking about everything that could go wrong, and so he used this twisted reasoning to cover up the concern he felt for Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi bore with the weakness of his body and left the cave. He quickly found a place to leave a distress signal for his subordinates to find, and then began to track Chu Lian's footprints to follow after her.</span></p>
