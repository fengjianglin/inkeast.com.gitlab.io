 <p><strong>Chapter 620: Phoenix Trap (8)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Chu Lian had expected, Senior Servant Lan sent someone in right after Royal Princess Duanjia came back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Royal Princess, Honoured Lady, let’s go. If we leave the banquet for too long, the Empress and Empress Dowager will start asking after you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian and Royal Princess Duanjia returned to the banquet together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian finally sat back down in her seat, she could sense a hostile, icy gaze on herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted her head and was met with an infuriated glare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was slightly stunned. She knew exactly who the owner of those eyes was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Princess Leyao…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t visited the palace in a very long time, so she had almost completely forgotten about this princess…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Princess Leyao was Imperial Concubine Wei’s only child and was originally the emperor’s youngest, most favoured daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the emperor had grounded Leyao ever since the last time Chu Lian had visited the palace. It was later rumoured that she had also been lectured by Eldest Princess Royal. Afterwards, there was another rumour that this princess was not as favored as before. However, it was hard to say whether the rumours were true or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In short, it was true that Princess Leyao hadn’t left the palace again after that day. It had been rather peaceful within the capital ever since she had been grounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was currently sitting beside Imperial Concubine Wei, drinking a cup of sweet wine while glaring at her with resentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Concubine Wei seemed to have noticed something amiss with her daughter’s gaze, so she also looked towards Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Concubine Wei made eye contact with Chu Lian. She suddenly gave Chu Lian a weird smile, leaving her baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was going on today? First, it was Xiao Bojian and Royal Princess Duanjia. Now, even Imperial Concubine Wei was joining in on the fun. They didn’t all have to show her that kind of secretive expression. She had enough to eat, warm clothes to wear, and He Sanlang to warm her bed. Therefore, she really wasn’t interested in their secrets…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt that everyone she had met today was abnormal. They all had a common problem, which was that they were all crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian replied with a faint smile, which almost caused Imperial Concubine Wei to choke on her frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she could, Imperial Concubine Wei would have definitely rushed towards the foolish and cheerful Chu Lian to give her a sound slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had just given that girl a mocking look, yet Chu Lian had sent back a happy smile in reply. There must be something wrong with her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Princess Leyao was still too young, so she didn’t have her mother’s ability to endure. She was ablaze with anger, and she wanted to get up to confront Chu Lian. However, she was promptly held down by Imperial Concubine Wei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The banquet held at the imperial gardens for the noble wives, imperial relatives, and the relatives of government officials came to an end under this strange atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Empress Dowager had originally wanted to extend the banquet, but a palace maidservant had rushed in and whispered something into the Empress and Empress Dowager’s ears. The expressions on the faces of the two women with the highest statuses in the kingdom had instantly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This scene had naturally fallen into everyone’s eyes, but the people present were mostly noble wives with keen senses. Their first reaction was to remain silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, the Empress and Empress Dowager were no longer in the mood to continue playing host.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Empress Dowager announced the end of the banquet. Court attendants had been arranged to send these noble women out of the rear court. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian supported her mother-in-law, Countess Jing’an, as they left with Old Duchess Zheng and Lady Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they were leaving, Chu Lian caught a glimpse of Consort Liang standing nearby with a palace maidservant supporting her. She suddenly fainted after hearing a palace maidservant’s report, causing a wave of commotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt a thump of unease when she recalled the Empress and Empress Dowager’s expressions at the end of the banquet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had something happened over at the Chengping Emperor’s side in Wanmin Hall?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Consort Liang was the birth mother of the second prince, who was also the current Crown Prince. Empress Shen didn’t have any children, while the favoured Imperial Concubine Wei only had a daughter, Imperial Princess Leyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were also the third to sixth princes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third prince had died when he was young. The fourth prince was Prince Jin, who had moved out of the palace. The fifth prince was naturally weak and cowardly, and his birth mother had died early.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last one was Sixth Prince, who was only fifteen years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the Empress and Empress Dowager to be so concerned, it must have something to do with one of the princes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Consort Liang had fainted, had something happened to the crown prince?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, not necessarily. Prince Jin had also been raised by Consort Liang. Moreover, it was said that she treated him even better than her own son, the crown prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, was it Prince Jin who had encountered a mishap?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi and Prince Jin were close friends. If something happened to Prince Jin, then He Changdi would also be implicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she thought of this possibility, Chu Lian’s entire body felt ice-cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hands, which were holding Countess Jing’an, also instantly lost their warmth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too many things had happened tonight, so Chu Lian’s mind was on high alert and she couldn’t help quickening her pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, Countess Jing’an had also sensed her anxious feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lian’er? Lian’er?” Countess Jing’an had to call out to Chu Lian a few times before she came back to her senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned her head and gave her an apologetic look. “Mother, I’m so sorry. I was distracted by some thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an looked at her helplessly. “Silly child. What are you thinking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, Countess Jing’an pulled out her arm and patted Chu Lian’s hand to comfort her. “The palace is a dangerous place. We’ll be alright as long as we abide by the rules, so you don’t have to think too much. Look, your father and Sanlang have come to pick us up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian looked up, she saw their men standing together at the bottom of the white marble stairs nearby. Her father-in-law was tall and burly, while He Changdi had the same tall stature with a cool temperament. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s bottomless gaze seemed to be filled with bright stars when she looked at him, giving her a deep sense of reassurance.</span></p>
