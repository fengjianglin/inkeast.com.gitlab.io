 <p><strong>Chapter 376: It's Hard to Say Sorry (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stared at He Sanlang in astonishment. "Isn't it spicy?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi's thin lips were slightly swollen. He licked them and, continuing his pretense of calm, said, "It was okay."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's eyes focused on his face, her almond-shaped eyes trying to discern whether he had been telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gaze drifted down to his neck. He Changdi's skin was fair, and the clothes he wore were a dark colour, making the colour of his neck even more obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His originally pale skin was now completely flushed red. There was a thin layer of sweat coating his neck, indicating that He Changdi probably hadn't been telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian went into a daze for a moment before she shifted her gaze away to the unassuming dark green collar resting against his neck. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The collar peeking out was from his undershirt. Although it was just a tiny sliver of collar, Chu Lian managed to recognise it instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely the undershirt that Li Yue had embroidered, the one that Wenqing had accidentally packed for him...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark green was an unassuming colour, so it shouldn't be noticeable when worn on the inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since it was Li Yue's first time embroidering, she wasn't very good at picking a matching thread colour. While it was true she needed a different colour for her patterns, she should have picked something closer to the shirt's colour. Instead, Li Yue had picked out some shiny thread with the colour of autumn leaves, thus making the crooked embroidery on the collar especially obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was extremely eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was so captivated by the collar that He Sanlang finally noticed that something was wrong. He looked downwards and realised that he was still wearing the undershirt that his wife had embroidered for him. His ears flushed red instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere within the tent was slowly turning a little weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian finally regained her senses, her face wrinkled up into a strange expression. She knew that He Changdi had probably assumed that that undershirt was her handiwork.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was trapped in a dilemma now. Should she tell him the truth or not?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she thought of the fits of insanity that He Changdi seemed prone to from time to time, she decided to remain silent on the matter for the sake of her own safety... If the truth ever came to light, she could honestly say that she had never claimed to have any part in making that undershirt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Lian still couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. She turned and poured a cup of warm water for him, kindly explaining, "The taste of the grilled beef is a little strong. Why don't you have some warm water to rinse away the flavour?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang coughed twice to hide his struggle before nodding. When he took the cup, he immediately drained it in one gulp...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian secretly watched from the side. Upon seeing how urgently he was drinking the water, she knew that she had guessed correctly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought back to how he had been eating so fervently and felt a little touched. If they had switched places and she had been the one served those extremely spicy beef slices, she probably wouldn't have been able to down a single one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were just like a loving couple. The husband would eat his wife's cooking without complaint, regardless of how it tasted, because it was made by his wife. For the sake of making her happy, he would pretend to love eating her food and polish off every last bit on the plate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian realised that He Changdi had the habit of never wasting any food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been like this even back at Songtao Court and even more so when eating that terrible bean paste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although He Sanlang's personality was too aloof and he would have random periods of insanity from time to time, her heart couldn’t help but soften to him. She wanted to treat him a little better. Chu Lian promised herself that she would never tease him in that manner ever again, and that she would always cook delicious food for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once He Sanlang got over the burning feeling in his mouth, he sipped a mouthful of lamb organ soup and pressed his lips together. Though he was hesitant, He Sanlang finally gathered his courage and said, "Chu Lian, many thanks to you for your help."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian blinked in surprise. The corners of her lips curled up as she said, "It was just a small suggestion. It's good if it'll be useful to you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>She acted so casually that He Sanlang didn't know what else to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As many different thoughts ran through his mind, the depths of He Changdi’s eyes grew as fathomless as the night sky dotted with the light of faraway stars. He finally let go of the unseen chains tying his mind to his past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although there were many similarities between this life and his old one, there were just as many differences. Everything seemed to have been reset. How could he be sure that the Chu Lian before him was the same Chu Lian from his past life?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than sharing the same face, their personalities were completely different!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He no longer wanted to escape reality. Despite how much he wanted to argue against it, a voice was calling out to him from deep within, reminding him that he had already fallen in love with the Chu Lian right in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an unavoidable truth that he didn't want to admit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had described how she had invented the snowboat as if it was a normal everyday thing to do, and it had indeed been as easy as drinking and eating for her. However, that wasn't what He Sanlang thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting hurt so deeply and encasing himself in unbreakable ice, He Changdi had thought that he would never develop feelings for any woman ever again. Who could have expected that his heart would fall for his greatest sworn enemy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that his personality was strong enough to withstand this turn of events, or he might have made himself go crazy for real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a period of silence within the tent that made Chu Lian feel like years had passed instead of just minutes. She adjusted her skirt and wondered whether she should try to take her leave. It was only then that she suddenly heard He Changdi's low, magnetic voice say, "Chu Lian, let's get along well from now on."</span></p>
