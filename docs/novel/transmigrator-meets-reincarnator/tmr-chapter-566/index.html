 <p><strong>Chapter 566: Too Much 'Nourishment' (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corners of Chu Lian’s lips twitched. She had just found out they truly wouldn’t be able to move in this position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With her covering He Changdi’s eyes and He Changdi carrying her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… then set me down and I’ll walk by myself,” Chu Lian suggested after a long moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s mouth curled into a smirk. “Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He made to set her down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian abruptly recalled the difference in height between them. If he really put her down like this, she would barely be able to cover his eyes, never mind that she would be straining to do so… In the end, she would be completely exposed to his gaze, putting her right back where she started in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing He Sanlang about to let her down, Chu Lian raised her voice in alarm. “Wait, wait!” she cried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s face was lit up with a mischievous smile. He shifted her higher and even managed to grope a feel while he was it. A blush immediately bloomed to life on Chu Lian’s cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you going to put down your hands? Do you really want to catch a cold?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian bit her lip and slowly pulled her arms back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She crossed her arms over her chest to hide the cherry buds on top of the ‘hills of snow’. However, it only pushed her hills together to form an even deeper tempting valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s gaze travelled down her neck to behold the view of that valley. His pupils dilated with interest, but he managed to hide it quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi would never put Chu Lian’s health at stake for a mere joke. Worried that she would really catch a cold, he swiftly carried her over to the changing screen and grabbed a large cloak. Then, he wrapped it securely around her before running out of the bathroom with her still in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took one of the blankets from the bed and added another layer of warmth around her before calling for Wenqing to help Chu Lian dry off. Meanwhile, he turned back and re-entered the bathroom instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Wenqing came in to help Chu Lian dress up, she couldn’t keep the smile off her face. Chu Lian was so embarrassed that she couldn’t look up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sounds of splashing water came from the bathroom. It was only then that Chu Lian realised that the bath water hadn’t been changed, and that it had already cooled down by the time she was done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hurriedly finished dressing and put on her shoes to rush over to the bathroom, only to see that her husband was already in the tub.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A twitch developed at the corner of her mouth. She reminded, “Hubby, that water’s already been used. I’ll call someone to get you a fresh change of water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Chu Lian could set off, He Changdi stopped her. “No need, I’m already done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he stood up from the bathtub without warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian got a good eyeful of his perfect figure: tightly packed abs, defined lines down his hips, and… a certain part of him that looked to be brimming with vigour...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian: …...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blush that had just faded from her cheeks came back to life, spreading all the way down to her neck this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was stunned speechless by the sight. It took a good moment before she managed to shift her gaze away in a panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By then, He Changdi had already walked up to her and was nonchalantly putting on his clothes...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stomped her foot in annoyance before fleeing pathetically from the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That He Sanlang! He looked like an cold, upright gentleman on the outside, but he was actually a great big pervert!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t he way too accepting of her? He had actually used her dirty bathwater...</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Sanlang stepped out of the bathroom, Senior Servant Zhong had come over to ask if they would like their meal served now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple had their dinner on the small table in the bedroom. It was an exceptionally fast meal and they quickly cleared the dishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While drinking her nourishing tonic, Chu Lian stared at He Changdi with a strange expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang lifted a brow. “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian tilted her head to one side and said, “I thought you were acting especially weird today. Why are you so rushed for time today? You even ate dinner quickly. Do you have to go to your study and settle some business?”</span></p>
