 <p><strong>Chapter 480: To Manage the Household (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Emperor had already verbally appointed He Changdi as an administrator of the Department of Appointments, He Changdi had yet to officially take up the post as he had just returned not too long ago. In order to receive the role, he would have to go to the imperial court for an official ceremony.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he and the other accomplished officers from the north had returned to the capital, they had all been granted half a month of leave after their meeting with the Emperor. During this period, He Sanlang planned to spend more quality time with his family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The couple continued whispering sweet nothings to each other in the bedroom. Once they had their breakfast, it was time for them to pay their respects to their elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two first visited Qingxi Hall before going over to Countess Jing’an’s courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an was leaning slightly skewed against the headboard of the bed with a thick quilt covering her body. She seemed to be in great spirits, perhaps thanks to He Changdi’s safe return from the north and the news of his great accomplishments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her previously thin and pale face had now gained a little more colour, making her seem more lively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi and Chu Lian went to visit Great Doctor Miao together and heard from him that Countess Jing’an’s condition was taking a turn for the better. In a few more days, he would use the Snow Mountain Mists flower to make some medicine and permanently cure the root of Countess Jing’an’s illness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young couple took a seat by Countess Jing’an’s bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an held Chu Lian’s hand as she chatted with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the middle of their conversation, Countess Jing’an smiled and said, “Lian’er, I’ve missed your cooking while you were away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A slight smile surfaced on Chu Lian’s face. “What would you like to eat, Mother? As long as it’s good for your health, I’ll make it right away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she had departed for the north, Chu Lian had regularly sent portions of food to the other courtyards whenever she cooked up something new in Songtao Court. She assumed that Countess Jing’an had become accustomed to her cooking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an looked to be in serious thought for a moment. “The candied kumquats I ate the last time were very good, but kumquats are hard to find right now. Would you be able to use hawthorns instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded with a smile. “Yes, hawthorns are fine too. I’ll make them myself and send them over to you when I’m done, Mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countess Jing’an chatted with the two for some time before letting them leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They made to leave the bedroom. However, right as they stepped out of the parlour, Chu Lian’s footsteps came to a halt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi found it strange, so he followed the direction of her gaze and looked towards the corridor on the right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They watched as a pregnant woman with a protruding belly began to walk towards them, supported by two servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pregnant woman seemed pretty young. She was wearing a loose apple-red robe with a matching brocade cloak. Her hair was shaped into a simple bun, with just an ordinary golden hairpin holding it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although her face had become chubbier, Chu Lian was still able to recognise her instantly. She was Countess Jing’an’s personal maidservant, Miaozhen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian hadn’t expected Miaozhen’s belly to have grown so quickly in the few months that she had been away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian thought of her eldest brother-in-law He Changqi, she felt sorry for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi and Chu Lian were standing in a rather secluded area. They were basically in Miaozhen’s blindspot. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Chu Lian and He Changdi were about to leave, they heard conversation coming from her direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the maidservants supporting Miaozhen asked, “Sister Miaozhen, are you feeling any discomfort today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miaozhen smiled and replied, “Not at all, I’m feeling good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servant then asked, “Sister Miaozhen, are you still craving sour foods?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Miaozhen didn’t reply and shyly nodded instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servant gave a wide smile. “Sister Miaozhen, my mother said that craving sour food means that it’s a boy and craving spicy food means that it’s a girl! The child in your belly is definitely a little young master!” The servant then paused for a moment, almost like she was afraid that someone might be eavesdropping. She intentionally moved closer to Miaozhen’s ear and lowered her voice as she said, “Our house doesn’t have a little young master yet, so if Sister Miaozhen gives birth to a boy, your position will be stable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had kept her voice quiet, but Chu Lian was still able to hear every word she said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The brows on Chu Lian’s little face furrowed together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Happiness was written all over Miaozhen’s face at the thought, while the servant supporting her giggled out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Chu Lian stared blankly at them, He Changdi grabbed her hand. His action warmed her icy cold hand, chilled from the February weather.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s handsome face reverted back to the grim expression that he put on in front of others. He stooped over and whispered into Chu Lian’s ear, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian stopped looking in Miaozhen’s direction and gave a slight nod in response. After getting her agreement, He Changdi quickly pulled her away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan and the other servants tactfully kept a distance while still following behind their masters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only when Chu Lian and He Changdi had finally left the parlour that Miaozhen noticed their presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately stopped in her tracks, subconsciously attempting to greet Third Young Master and Madam, but it was impossible for her to catch up to them considering the speed at which He Sanlang was dragging Chu Lian away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servants by Miaozhen’s sides stared after the tall figure of He Changdi with dazed looks. “Sister Miaozhen, is that Third Young Master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miaozhen nodded. Her brows knitted together, but she didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked away and continued heading towards Countess Jing’an’s bedroom.</span></p>
