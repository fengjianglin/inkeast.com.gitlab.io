 <p><strong>Chapter 440: Warmth (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian cleared her throat to gloss over the awkward moment. She lifted the curtain and asked, “It’s so late, why aren’t you resting yet? Do you have something urgent to tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although He Sanlang’s eyes were lowered, he had been watching Chu Lian from the corner of his vision. When she had paused in front of the pearl curtain at the door and had been seemingly entranced by him, he was beside himself with delight despite his cold countenance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Restraining the fireworks in his heart, He Changdi said in a low, husky voice, “I remembered that there is something I haven’t given you yet, so I came over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked at him doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She walked over and sat down beside him. Tilting her head to one side, she asked, “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi covered his mouth and coughed before shifting his gaze elsewhere. “When have I ever lied to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s brows creased together. Her limpid eyes stared at He Changdi, her suspicion as clear as day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This lunatic He Sanlang was always full of empty words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang inwardly scolded Chu Lian for ‘shamelessly’ staring at him. She was too brazen for her own good. However, he also felt like he was floating on cloud nine at the same time. He enjoyed this ‘scorching hot’ gaze of hers and he wished that Chu Lian would only ever have him in her eyes. Thus, a short while later, the tips of his ears began to redden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian held her hand out towards He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang caught sight of her small, outstretched hand as he looked up. Before he realised it, he had already reached out to grab it with his larger, coarse hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As their hands came into contact, it felt as if a spark of electricity had traced its way up their arms to strike directly into their hearts. He Sanlang couldn’t help rubbing and kneading her soft and delicate hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His wife’s hand was so lovely to the touch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hand was so soft, so warm, and especially smooth. It was so tender and fragile that he was afraid of squeezing too hard. Coming here tonight was the wisest decision he had ever made.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s temples twitched. She watched as He Sanlang’s chiseled face gradually turned warmer while his eyes lit up like the stars in the night sky. She could feel his large palm enveloping her hand. As if grabbing her hand wasn’t enough, he rubbed and caressed it all over, like he had just found his favourite toy. It looked to her like he wanted to commit even the length of her nails to memory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this feeling wasn’t half bad, this wasn’t what she had intended when she had held her hand out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian forcefully pulled hand back before once again showing her palm to He Changdi. “So where is it? Didn’t you say that you wanted to give me something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only then that He Sanlang finally understood why his wife had held out her hand. So it hadn’t been for him to touch; it was to ask him for her present…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang felt like he had been dealt a blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The icy countenance that had thawed a little froze right over again. He scanned the young girl before him with half-lidded eyes. Inwardly, he was fuming- he wanted to punish this ‘wicked’ woman. Unfortunately, his heart was willing but his flesh was weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang retracted his gaze and didn’t try to continue touching Chu Lian’s hand. Chu Lian thought that he was purposely feigning ignorance and was about to speak up when she heard a violent fit of coughing from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s brows creased together. Worried, she asked, “What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell? Is it because you had a drink earlier? Brother Guo and the others are really too much; even if we’re celebrating New Year’s, they shouldn’t make a sick person drink…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian grumbled on and on until Wenlan couldn’t hold back any longer. “Third Young Madam, the outer room’s windows are still open for ventilation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are the windows open in the peak of winter? Hurry up and close them!” Chu Lian awkwardly ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan was speechless. It had been Third Young Madam who had complained that the room was too warm in the first place due to the hearth! She had been the one to order them to open the windows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan shut the windows before turning around and suggesting, “In this servant’s opinion, Third Young Master and Third Young Madam should move to the inner room to talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian thought it over and turned to He Changdi. “Do you need someone to carry you over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang shook his head. “I’ll be fine if you help me. Only one of my legs is injured. I can’t walk too far, but such a short distance is fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian also felt that it would be too heartless to wake the servants up at this time, since most of them had already gone to rest for the night. Thus, she followed his wishes and lended him her arm for support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Knowing that Third Young Madam’s body was slender and fragile, Wenlan was afraid that she wouldn’t be able to support their tall Third Young Master. She was about to step forward and offer her help, but before she could walk over, she felt a frosty glare from He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan was so shocked that she stayed rooted to the spot. Realisation dawned upon her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really was dumb; of course Third Young Master was still able to walk! He obviously wanted to take this opportunity to get closer to Third Young Madam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was overjoyed for Third Young Madam. As long as Third Young Master cared about their Third Young Madam, their days would only become more and more blissful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a smile, Wenlan stealthily retreated to the side room, even dismissing the two maidservants that were on duty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s head was at the same height as He Changdi’s shoulders, and that was only because she had grown a little last year. Otherwise, she would only be as tall as his chest, like before. Despite all that, she still appeared frail and puny beside He Sanlang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi rested an arm around Chu Lian’s shoulders. With half of his body leaning on hers, he carefully got off the hearth bed. His large black cape practically covered Chu Lian’s whole body. The two of them were so close that Chu Lian could smell the bitter ointment on his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the two of them like this, it didn’t look like Chu Lian was supporting him. Instead, it seemed more like He Changdi was embracing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, He Changdi wasn’t even putting much of his body weight on her because there was no way she would be able to shoulder that burden with the little strength she had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young couple then entered the bedroom together.</span></p>
