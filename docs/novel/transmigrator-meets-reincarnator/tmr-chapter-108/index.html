 <p><strong>Chapter 108: A Peaceful Courtyard (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way back to the main branch's courtyard with her husband, Madam Zou's head remained lowered as she seemed to be in deep thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, He Changqi just had to move up beside her with a regretful expression as he lamented, "If only Third Sister-in-Law knew how to cook venison. I wonder how delicious that would be."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this come from her own husband, Madam Zou was frustrated beyond belief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her footsteps paused for a moment before she quickened her pace, leaving her slow, dimwitted husband behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, Yuanjing, Yuanjing! Slow down a little! It's dark and the paths are uneven!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou bit her lip with a terrible expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since her husband had come back yesterday, he had kept talking about how popular Chu Lian's longevity peach buns had been at Marquis Dingyuan's longevity feast. He had narrated the tale once to his mother, and then once more at the family dinner in Qingxi Hall. Now he was even expressing his regret that Chu Lian didn't know how to cook venison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As He Changqi's legitimate wife, how could she not be angry?</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what if her sister-in-law was good at cooking? Chu Lian was Sanlang's wife! Not He Changqi's!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Zou felt extremely stifled by this treatment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Chu Lian found out the reason behind her eldest sister-in-law's sudden irritation towards her, she definitely would have cried at her brother-in-law, He Changqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brother! Why are you digging holes for me?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, is Eldest Sister-in-Law aware of how dense you are?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Senior Servant Gui was helping Chu Lian change for the night, she handed over the silver taels she had gotten from selling off the jewellery. She also passed over the items that Chu Lian had requested on her list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While heading towards her little study, Chu Lian opened the small wooden box that Senior Servant Gui had given to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside were four small gold bricks, which sat together with the silver accessories she had ordered before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui, who was following right behind her, hesitated for a moment before she spoke up. "Third Young Madam, why don't you save these taels instead? Although we're living in the estate now, you're only a member of the third branch, after all. Third Young Master won't be inheriting the family title. After the matriarch passes away, each branch of the family will undoubtedly be split up. With Eldest Young Madam controlling the estate’s finances, you won't get much for your expenses!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned and looked strangely at Senior Servant Gui. Under the light of the lanterns around them, her almond-shaped eyes were like shining stars and as clear as water. "</span><i><span style>Momo</span></i><span style>, are you expecting me to get rich just by saving money?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui turned speechless. After a pause, she tried to continue her persuasion. "But you've just started managing your branch of the family. Perhaps it wouldn't be too good to spend so much right from the beginning."</span></p>
 <p><span style>What she didn't say was that, if Chu Lian started bestowing rewards on people without any particular reason, it would be setting a hard precedent to live up to. If the servants were given regular rewards from then on, then they would definitely expect even more on special occasions. If not, the servants would become disappointed, making them hard to manage in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, although those custom-made silver accessories weren't too expensive, they were all high-class designs! They would even be suitable for the imperial family to wear, let alone a few noble servants. </span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Chu Lian had already walked into her study and arrived at her desk. She set the wooden box down and took out the silver accessories within, moving them to a lacquered redwood tray, which Chu Lian had specially covered with a dark blue silk cloth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contrast between the dark blue and the glint of the silver made the accessories shine even brighter. Coupled with the novelty of their designs, they were comparable to any set of gold accessories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Momo</span></i><span style>, don't worry. Didn't Grandmother give me a restaurant?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s reply was rather distracted as she happily arranged the accessories on the lacquered tray, separating them into different types.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui couldn't say a word. A restaurant? That lousy restaurant?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't located in a busy area of the capital, the dishes were just average, and it couldn't even earn its upkeep. How could it be counted as a source of income for them? It would be good enough if they could break even!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui was seriously wondering if the matriarch had it out for Chu Lian and if she had given Chu Lian that failing restaurant to make her pay for its upkeep.</span></p>
