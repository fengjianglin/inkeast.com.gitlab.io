 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 208: A Request from Duchess Zheng (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Matriarch He heard her explanation, she was stunned. She couldn't have imagined that the problem laid with Old Duke Zheng. Apparently, he was currently bedridden and refusing food and drink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those close to House Zheng knew that Old Duke Zheng was a glutton for food. He had visited most of the top-ranked restaurants in the capital. Ever since he had passed the duke's seat to his heir, Old Duke Zheng would travel far and wide every day to search for any and all gourmet food. He had recently returned home two months ago, but for some reason, he had completely lost his appetite! It was almost to the point that Old Duke Zheng was refusing to eat any food at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the reason behind her request was revealed, the two Duchesses Zheng looked at Chu Lian with hope in their eyes. Chu Lian felt a little embarrassed to be the focus of their expectant stares.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He hadn't thought that Old Duchess Zheng's request would turn out to be something like this. She didn't know whether to laugh or cry; her only choice was to tell the truth. "Old Sister, I know that you're worried for Old Duke Zheng. I'll just speak honestly with you: Sanlang's wife does know how to make some interesting new dishes, but we can't promise that we'll be able to solve your problem for you. We can only say that Sanlang's wife will try her best." </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aye! Of course! As long as Honoured Lady Jinyi is willing to help out, I'll be endlessly grateful. We have simply run out of ideas. The old man isn't willing to eat anything at all. If this continues, his body won't be able to hold on..." It was clear by her tone that Old Duchess Zheng was anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they had finally gotten Chu Lian's agreement as well as Matriarch He’s promise to help with Old Duchess Zheng's request, they set the date to come visit the Zheng Estate for three days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian wanted to hide her face in her hands, but she honestly didn't know whether it was to start sobbing or laughing her heart out. In the original story, Old Duke Zheng had passed away about two months from now. Had the cause of his death truly been from refusing food after being unable to taste the gourmet flavours he craved for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they reached the point where their paths home diverged, Old Duchess Zheng bid her farewells and led her daughter-in-law back to their own carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now only Matriarch He and Chu Lian were left in the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He gently petted Chu Lian's fair, tender hand. "Lian'er, you've done us a great service today. Otherwise, our house would have completely lost its reputation."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian realised that the matriarch liked to call her 'Lian'er' when they were talking in private.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smiled and said, "Grandmother, don't say that. I'm also a part of House Jing'an; I was just doing my part for our House."</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she heard Chu Lian's answer, Matriarch He was even more gratified. "You silly child. It's been hard for you. It's not all your eldest sister-in-law's fault today, so don't hold a grudge against her. Grandmother knows that it's not easy for her either."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt a slight pang of shock. She hadn't expected the matriarch to think that she might hold a grudge. "We're all one big family. What is there to hold a grudge over? Eldest Sister-in-law couldn't have known that she would lose the round cakes like that. We still need Eldest Sister-in-law to manage our household in the future!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grandmother knows. Your eldest sister-in-law has been treating you too harshly recently. Don't worry, Grandmother will remind her of her duties."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian tried her best to suppress the fright in her heart. She didn't realise that Matriarch He had those sorts of thoughts in her mind. Did she think that Chu Lian had come out to save the day and bring glory to the family just to slap Madam Zou in the face for mistreating her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian inwardly sighed. The fatigue of the day was starting to catch up with her. No wonder the older generations liked to say that communication was key. Chu Lian felt that clearing the misunderstanding with Matriarch He right now would be better than letting it persist and affect her later on. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian looked up at the matriarch. Her almond-shaped eyes shone with intelligence under the dim lighting of the lanterns within the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grandmother, there's an order of seniority in the family. It was Granddaughter-in-Law's fortune to be able to marry into the He Family. Granddaughter-in-Law doesn't have much ambition or talent, and would just like to live out peaceful days full of making delicious food. If it earns some income, then that's even better. Granddaughter-in-Law is very lazy. After doing all these things, Granddaughter-in-Law would rather take a nap in the courtyard or give Grandmother some company. Although Sanlang is from the main line of inheritance, he's the third son after all. There are two older brothers above him, and Granddaughter-in-Law naturally ranks the lowest in this family. Eventually, we might even have a Second Sister-in-Law joining the family!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Chu Lian wanted to say was that she really didn't want to be in control of the household, and she didn't have any intention at all to oust Eldest Brother-in-Law or Eldest Sister-in-law from their places in the family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she watched the young girl before her making such a clear case for herself, Matriarch He's sharp eyes grew ever brighter. In the end, she sighed and patted Chu Lian's hand. "Grandmother has blamed you unjustly." </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was finally able to relax. Everything that she had just said were her true thoughts. It was better to be a layabout. Who would want to crack their brains thinking about how to support a noble house all day? As well as trying to figure out how to best socialise with the various other noble houses in the capital?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian smiled and shook her head. "I don't blame Grandmother. Our hearts are all hidden in our chests. Even the wisest man wouldn't be able to see into human hearts. Granddaughter-in-Law just hopes that Grandmother can voice out any problems first, rather than keeping it inside. Granddaughter-in-Law will definitely change for the better!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being frank and sincere, as well as opening your heart, was the best way to communicate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had no desire to play twisted mind games with others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He found that she was starting to like this granddaughter-in-law of hers even more, after this honest talk with her in the carriage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She reached out to poke Chu Lian in the forehead. "You silly girl! Don't think that Grandmother can't see through your thoughts! You just want to laze at home all day. Although your eldest sister-in-law is around to take care of the family, you can't be too lazy either, since you're the lady-in-charge for your branch of the family. In the future, when all of us seniors aren't around anymore, you and Sanlang will have to separate your branch of the family and live on your own. If you don't know how to do anything at all, how are you going to manage your own house in the future?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Lian had cleared away the doubts in Matriarch He's heart, she started to act cutely like a child towards the matriarch. Matriarch He was the first senior who had treated her well since she had come to the Great Wu Dynasty, so she had already taken this affable old woman to be her real grandmother in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She leaned against Matriarch He's side and playfully replied, "But Grandmother will still be around to help Granddaughter-in-Law out~! When Sanlang and I leave the estate to create our own household, Grandmother has to come along, too! Otherwise, Granddaughter-in-Law won't be able to manage a household on her own! The servants will make fun of me then!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You little imp! Since you already know that, why are you still trying to think of ways to skive off all day?"</span></p>
