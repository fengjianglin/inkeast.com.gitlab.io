 <p><strong>Chapter 663: Suspicion (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian seemed rather confused. She couldn’t understand what Senior Servant Zhong meant by her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned towards Senior Servant Zhong with a dazed expression. Since they were getting along well now, why did they have to sleep separately?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong coughed and tried to explain patiently, “Third Young Madam, since you’re pregnant now, you have to take care of your body. You and Third Young Master are both young, so it might be hard to… control yourselves at night. If your activities were to harm the child, then it wouldn’t be good, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong had already phrased it as directly as she could. If Chu Lian couldn’t understand it even now, then she would be an idiot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s face immediately flushed red. That… she had never thought of the problem of sleeping arrangements after getting pregnant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Chu Lian wasn’t very willing to sleep separately, she had come from the modern world and didn’t know what the customs were here. She didn’t know what He Changdi’s opinion was either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, she decided not to blindly make a decision now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian acted as if she was too shy to speak and refused to reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong got a little antsy upon seeing that she wasn’t replying. “Third Young Madam, please listen to this old servant. The first three months of pregnancy are crucial, and it’s easy for accidents to happen at this stage. Furthermore, all noble families follow this rule.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old servant was about to try persuading her further, when a low and menacing man’s voice sounded behind her. “No need. Just bring in a chaise for me to sleep next to the bed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that it was He Changdi behind her, Senior Servant Zhong turned around in stunned surprise. Chu Lian looked up, clearly pleasantly surprised to see him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The joy shining in Chu Lian’s sparkling eyes couldn’t be hidden at all, shimmering like two bright stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing her elated expression, He Changdi knew that his decision had earned his wife’s favour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong gaped a little before replying reluctantly, “Wouldn’t that be too hard on Third Young Master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need to say anymore. I’ve already decided.” He Changdi’s tone was resolute, leaving no room for anyone to change his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong shut her mouth and sighed inwardly. She was also happy for Third Young Madam. Third Young Master seemed to care for Third Young Madam more than she thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, this old servant will make the arrangements now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi waved his hand. “If there’s nothing else, you’re dismissed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong bobbed in respect and was about to leave when He Changdi called out to her. “</span><i><span style>Momo</span></i><span style>, keep the servants under control. Don’t let the news of Lian’er’s pregnancy out for the time being.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong seemed to hesitate. “Then the old residence…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since they had moved out from the Jing’an Estate, for He Changdi and Chu Lian, the Jing’an Estate had become the old residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi paused before shaking his head slightly. “Keep it a secret from the old residence too. We’ll wait until Lian’er hits two months and her pregnancy is stable. When the time comes, I’ll personally take Lian’er to the old residence to announce the good news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Zhong was thinking of persuading him otherwise, but when she thought back to Great Doctor Miao’s diagnosis, she swallowed her words back down. Great Doctor Miao had said that they had almost lost the child in Chu Lian’s belly. If anything happened and they told the old residence too early, wouldn’t they just be giving everyone false hope? The senior family members living in the old residence might even blame Third Young Master and Madam for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Waiting until the pregnancy was stable before making the announcement would be the best course of action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant nodded upon understanding the circumstances. She bobbed once again towards Chu Lian and He Changdi before quietly retreating out of the room to manage the other maidservants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Senior Servant Zhong left, He Changdi strode over to Chu Lian’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached out with his powerful arms and slid them under her knees and back, lifting her from the chaise in a princess carry before settling onto the chaise with her on top.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi placed one hand on Chu Lian’s shoulders, while the other was placed gently on her belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His tone was filled with a soft warmth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lian’er, we’re going to have a child.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was equally happy. She had been waiting for this little bean’s arrival for a few months now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hubby, would you like a boy or a girl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian raised her head to stare into He Changdi’s soft gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi bent over slightly to place a kiss on her smooth forehead. “A daughter. It would be best if she looks like you. She’ll definitely be very cute.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian puffed up her cheeks and glared at him. “You’re just saying that to make me happy, right? Eldest Brother only has Little An and Little Lin, and Second Brother hasn’t gotten married yet. It’s not just Grandmother, but even Father and Mother are probably waiting for me to give birth to a boy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi stiffened. He hadn’t expected Chu Lian to respond this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought back to what Great Doctor Miao had told him in private. The doctor had mentioned that pregnant women were more susceptible to changes in mood as well as emotions, and that he had to be more understanding and forgiving of his wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His brows relaxed and he stroked Chu Lian’s silky hair with one hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, He Changdi had truly been speaking his mind. He did want a daughter for his first child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought of having a mini Chu Lian running around, his heart immediately melted into a puddle of mush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether it’s a boy or a girl, they’ll be our child. I’ll treat them the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the future little bun were to find out what his father had said today, he would definitely burst into tears and question his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A satisfied smile surfaced on Chu Lian’s face after getting He Changdi’s answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a modern person at heart and she didn’t favour any gender in particular. No matter which gender their child belonged to, she would still guide and protect them all the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, it wasn’t up to her whether she gave birth to a boy or a girl. If it didn’t turn out to be a boy, then it was He Changdi’s problem.</span></p>
