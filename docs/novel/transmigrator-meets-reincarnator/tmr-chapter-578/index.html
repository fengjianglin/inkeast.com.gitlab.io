 <p><strong>Chapter 578: Mishap (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi let out a cold snort and mercilessly rejected his older brother. “Second Brother, if you want to keep drinking, you can do it by yourself. I’m tired, so I’m heading back to my place to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, He Changjue was a stubborn one. He continued hanging onto He Changdi’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it just because Third Sister-in-Law might be waiting up for you? Don’t worry! It’s already this late, I’m sure she’s already gone to bed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi chuckled coldly. “Someone who’s still single won’t understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s words stirred up the hornet’s nest. He Changjue still had enough consciousness left to recognise the insult. Furthermore, his path to love had never been smooth. His brother’s mocking tipped him over the edge and he leaped up to attack He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, He Changdi was no pushover. They started brawling noisily right there in the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps due to their drunkenness, the brothers fought fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The maidservant waiting outside was pale with fright. She hurriedly ran off to find the steward. The steward was already old, so there was no way he could pull apart his two masters. In the end, he ordered some servants to bring the family soldiers here to stop their fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You little brat! Don’t you dare show off with your wife in front of me in the future, or I’ll knock all your teeth out!” He Erlang was still scolding his little brother when they were pulled apart, the very picture of a drunk maniac.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had suffered a punch of the corner of his lips, which was starting to bruise. However, at least he had left Erlang in much worse shape. He shifted his jaw and muttered ‘idiot’ under his breath. Just as he was about to return to the inner court to look for his wife, the steward stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, Second Young Master, Third Young Master, please, drink a bowl of sobering soup before you head back to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a maidservant standing behind the assistant steward with a food container in hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the steward finished speaking, the maidservant hurried forward and set down the box on the table. She brought out two warm bowls of sobering soup and offered one each to He Changjue and He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that brief bout, both brothers were a little thirsty. He Changjue took the bowl and downed it in one gulp. He even had another two cups of tea in addition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi took up the porcelain bowl. When he put it to his mouth, he frowned. The smell of this sobering soup was strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t like drinking these types of medicinal soups, so he only had less than half the bowl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had already sent someone to Songtao Court to ask about his wife on his return to the estate. The person he sent returned to say that Third Young Madam had already gone to bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang escorted his brother to the study’s side room and waited until the servants had helped him out of his clothes and laid him in bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assistant steward drew closer with a smile. “Third Young Master, would you like to rest here in the outer court, or return to the inner court tonight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Chu Lian was already asleep, He Changdi told the steward to arrange a side room for him in the outer court as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assistant steward personally led He Sanlang to the side room on the left of the main study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he entered the room, He Changdi came out again in a few minutes. He told the manservant guarding the door outside, “Prepare the room next to Second Brother. I’ll sleep over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manservant quickly ran off to follow his orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While He Erlang was a good drinker, he became unreliable once he was high. He Sanlang was worried that something would happen to him in the night, so he decided to watch over his brother instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he finally laid down to rest, it was already an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he had gotten married, He Changdi hadn’t spent many nights in the outer court’s main study. He had also slept in this particular side room a few times before. However, for some reason, it felt uncomfortable this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blankets didn’t feel as soft, the bedding wasn’t comfortable enough, and his sides were empty, making him feel like the entire room was too empty and quiet.</span></p>
