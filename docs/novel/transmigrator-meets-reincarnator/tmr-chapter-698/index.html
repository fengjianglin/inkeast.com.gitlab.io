 <p><strong>Transmigrator Meets Reincarnator</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 698: Hidden Tempest (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian found it strange as well. The original novel hadn’t mentioned much of Miss Su. Over the few times they had interacted, Chu Lian understood that Miss Su wasn’t an innocent and naive young lady. Perhaps this was what she had chosen for herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for how Miss Yuan had struck an agreement with her, Chu Lian didn’t want to know. She had nothing to do with House Ying now anyway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was better for her to keep a peaceful mind and wait for the birth of her child in her own estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Royal Princess Duanjia saw how calm Chu Lian was acting, she gaped a little. “Chu Liu, aren’t you curious at all about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian poured a new cup of honey water for herself before answering, “You know what my relationship with House Ying is like. I don’t want to pay attention to whether they’re doing fine or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia set down the cake in her hands and shifted closer to Chu Lian, “It’s good that you’ve already drawn the lines between you and House Ying. That father of yours isn’t someone good anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian thought to herself, she was a transmigrated soul. Her father wasn’t in this world at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia stayed until He Changdi returned, upon which she was chased away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was getting harder for Chu Lian to move around, so she had Senior Servant Zhong send Royal Princess Duanjia away in place of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi walked up to Chu Lian. With a smooth and practised movement, he slid one arm under her back and another under her knees. He then lifted her up from the chaise and brought her into their bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had a little blush on her face. She patted He Changdi’s solid chest, “I’m a little heavy now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang looked down at his blushing wife. Although his face was still stuck in its stiff expression, the look in his eyes was as warm and gentle as could be. He bent down to kiss her soft lips before speaking in husky tones, “I don’t mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was set down in a sitting position on the bed. He Changdi grabbed a thin blanket from the side and covered her with it. He sat by the bed, an arm slung around Chu Lian’s shoulders as he pulled her to lean on his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian raised her chin slightly to look at him. She noticed the stubble on his chin and the dark circles under his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She touched his slightly prickly chin and asked, “Did you just get back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi nodded, “The situation at court is becoming more worrying. I can’t leave it alone for long. I took some time to visit Prince Yongkang’s Estate in the afternoon. Since Royal Princess Duanjia came by, I suppose you already know all about what happened?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chu Lian no longer kept contact with House Ying, from an outsider’s perspective, Chu Lian was one of House Ying’s ladies. He Changdi had gone to Prince Yongkang’s Estate in place of her to give their congratulations to the new couple, and to prevent any loose tongues from wagging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded, “How is Fifth Sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s brows were slightly furrowed, “She’s still in Prince Yongkang’s Estate. The guests have already left, but Royal Prince Shou kept her back. I’ve had my men investigate this matter. Chu Su and Royal Prince Shou have met before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes widened, she was clearly shocked by this news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi snorted, “I’ve told you before, your Fifth Sister isn’t a simple person. This time, the entire Ying Estate is likely going to fall, thanks to these two sisters. However, I would be glad to see that happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Yuan had likely intended on taking revenge on House Ying, so she had come to some agreement with Miss Su in secret. One of the troublemakers had now disappeared by herself, while the other had been married to Royal Prince Shou as per her wishes, and was now safe in Prince Yongkang’s Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was rather in ‘awe’ of these two sisters. However, it didn’t matter to her whatever happened to them now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you tired? Do you want to nap for a bit?” Chu Lian asked He Changdi tenderly. He had been keeping late nights recently. At his busiest, he might not even return home for one or two days. He had slimmed down visibly. Whenever he made a rare trip home, he could only hug her to sleep before heading out again early the next morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi rubbed his temples and stood up to take off his outer robes. He tossed his clothes to one side and slid under the blankets next to his wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He carefully hugged Chu Lian, his other hand reaching to her chest and groping it. The eyes he had just shut flew open again, and warm puffs of breath blew over Chu Lian’s sensitive ear as he said, “It’s a lot bigger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t it normal for her breasts to swell during pregnancy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to sleep or not?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi kissed her earlobe, a smile evident in his slightly husky voice, “I’m sleeping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian moved his wandering hand down to her waist. He Changdi didn’t resist and simply pressed even closer to the soft body in his arms, “Lian’er, please wait two more months. Once everything is settled, I’ll spend more time with you, and our child.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just go to sleep. I’m doing just fine by myself without you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t like the other noble madams, who were carefree without their men around. She had plenty on her plate to do!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi chuckled into her ear. Soon, his low chuckles faded into soft breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had fallen asleep so quickly, he must have been very, very tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somewhere else, within a plain residence, there was a couple locked in embrace with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman was sprawled in the man’s arms. Before she could even catch her breath, the man was already questioning her impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the information I asked you to get from Imperial Concubine Wei?” Xiao Bojian’s voice was husky from their recent activities and release.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman harrumphed in a charming manner and directed a pout with her full, red lips at Xiao Bojian, “How heartless, Sir Xiao. You didn’t even me rest for a bit. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll change my mind and refuse to tell you anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian suddenly let out a sinister smile. The gap between the darkness in his eyes and his ethereal features made the woman drunk on his beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really not going to tell me, Madam?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman looked his body up and down with a seductive gaze, and caught hold of his face, “I can’t bear not to tell you, thanks to this face of yours.”</span></p>
