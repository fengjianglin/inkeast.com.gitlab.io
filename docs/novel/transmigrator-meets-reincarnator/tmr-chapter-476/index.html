 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing held Xiyan’s arm and shook her head. She whispered, “Sister Xiyan, you don’t have to worry so much. Third Young Master usually dotes on Third Young Madam; why would he bully her? As servants, we shouldn’t interfere with our masters’ business. Moreover, Third Young Madam didn’t call for us. We can’t just go in like that. Also, think about Third Young Madam’s personality. If she was really being bullied, wouldn’t she call for help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xiyan was still worried, Wenqing ultimately convinced her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After their masters had returned to Songtao Court, they were able to see for themselves how much Third Young Master cared for Third Young Madam. Also, Third Young Madam was someone who would definitely return an eye for an eye. If she really suffered any grievances, she wouldn’t endure it in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two personal maidservants stayed up until midnight. Xiyan finally breathed a sigh of relief when they could no longer hear any movement within the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing finally relaxed as well, her face flushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since their masters had settled down for the night, they didn’t need two servants to stay up for the night shift. In the end, Wenqing told Xiyan to take a rest and leave her to keep watch through the night in the side room by herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving the room, Xiyan didn’t immediately go back to her room to rest. She headed to Senior Servant Gui’s room first to report that the young couple had finally consummated their marriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui was still awake, waiting for Xiyan’s report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After receiving the news, Senior Servant Gui clasped her hands together and bowed in prayer. A smile appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pushed Xiyan and said, “Well, I can rest assured now. If Third Young Madam gives birth to a son in the future, I’ll be able to enjoy my old age in peace. It’s getting late now. You should hurry and go sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan watched as, contrary to what she had just told Xiyan, Senior Servant Gui got up from her bed and began to get dressed instead. Curious, she asked, “</span><i><span style>Momo</span></i><span style>, why are you getting up when it’s already this late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui’s grin was so wide that her eyes disappeared. “Sixth Miss has a thin and weak body. This first night must have been tough for her. I’m going to brew some nourishing soup for her to drink first thing in the morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing how excited Senior Servant Gui was, Xiyan didn’t stop her. “</span><i><span style>Momo</span></i><span style>, do rest earlier when you’re done. I’ll go back to my room first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan and Fuyan lived in the same room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiyan returned to her room, she saw that the room was still lit. Her brows creased into a frown and she muttered to herself, “It’s already so late, why hasn’t Fuyan slept yet? What’s that girl doing at this hour!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly walked towards the door and tried pushing it open, only to find out that someone had actually locked it from the inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s personal maidservants all lived together in a small courtyard within Songtao Court. They usually took turns to be on standby with their masters at night, so the courtyard entrance and the room doors were never locked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also a senior servant guarding the courtyard entrance at night. It was even more strictly guarded outside, so nothing had ever happened before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of suspicion was aroused in Xiyan’s heart. She called out softly to Fuyan from outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuyan suffered a fright when she heard the door being pushed. She had been expecting Xiyan to be on duty until morning since she was taking the night shift. Who could have thought that Xiyan would return to their room at this time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She panicked and hid the letter she had been clutching in her hands underneath her pillow. Then, she straightened out her dress and calmed her breathing before opening the door as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the door opened from the inside, Xiyan immediately entered the room, only to see that Fuyan hadn’t even changed her clothes. It was obvious that she hadn’t slept yet, so Xiyan asked, “It’s so late, why aren’t you resting? It’s your turn to serve Third Young Madam tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuyan went over to the bed and sat down. She picked up the sewing basket next to her and said, “I wanted to finish sewing the flower on this handkerchief before going to sleep. I didn’t realise that time flew by so quickly. So it’s already midnight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiyan furrowed her brows. “There’s no need to stay up so late. You can work on the handkerchief anytime. Alright, go to sleep now. If something goes wrong tomorrow, </span><i><span style>momo</span></i><span style> won’t spare you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I’ll listen to Sister Xiyan. I’ll pack my things up and sleep now. It won’t happen again.”</span></p>
