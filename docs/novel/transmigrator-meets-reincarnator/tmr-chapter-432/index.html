 <p><strong>Chapter 432: The New Year (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang's eyes shone with the light of the stars as he fixated on Chu Lian’s flushed face and heavy breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was turning redder and redder under the weight of his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, He Sanlang actually broke out into a smile and he let out a peal of relaxed laughter. That spontaneous, genuine smile shocked Chu Lian silly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was well-known for his outstanding appearance all over the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Chu Lian had arrived in the Great Wu Dynasty, all she had seen of him was his aloof and haughty side. He always kept a cold aura cloaked around himself to repel everyone away from him. She had never seen such an unguarded, unrestrained smile from him before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That rare display of emotions from him drew a profound change in her own heart; it was as if an ancient wall of ice had melted under the strength of the sun. It felt warm and comfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to his usual cool facade, Chu Lian felt that this agreeable, warm look suited He Sanlang more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she thought back to the original story's description of him, this was likely how He Changdi had been before he had gotten married!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pang of sympathy surfaced in her heart when her thoughts led her to that reminder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she didn't know why he was fighting so hard, she knew that he must have some sort of reason for his actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that Chu Lian had broken the strange mood that had been hanging over them, a little of He Sanlang's rationality had returned. He suppressed the desires in his heart, but kept Chu Lian close to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the passion from before, his voice was still a little husky. "Yes, I'm horrible. It's my bad, I shouldn't have lied to you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had already suffered several rounds of fright ever since waking up this morning. Her life was terribly exciting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared at He Changdi, mouth agape. So this stubborn man actually had times when he would apologise?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pulled out her hand and felt He Sanlang's forehead, murmuring under her breath as she did so. "That's weird, he doesn't have a fever..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The warmth on He Sanlang's expression immediately faded away, exchanged for frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a mix of shame and anger, he shouted, "Chu Lian!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian laughed sheepishly. "Ehe. So you're actually normal sometimes, my dear husband?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"When have I been abnormal?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You've always been abnormal." Unfortunately, Chu Lian didn’t dare to speak her true thoughts. She wasn't so stupid as to provoke the bear who currently had her in his clutches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Sanlang looked down and noticed that her eyes were sparkling with humour, he had the urge to rub his cheeks against hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the urge came over him, he acted it out without any restraint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian suffered the stabbing, prickling sensation of stubble on her tender skin and quickly shook her head, trying to dodge his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She raged, "He Changdi, you haven't shaved!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The air between the couple had turned harmonious all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time He Changdi had his fill of snuggling, the two of them were panting for breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang cradled the back of Chu Lian's head with his palm, pressing her head against his broad chest. He took a deep breath to gather his determination before declaring, "Chu Lian, once I'm fully healed, let's get together. If... that's alright with you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Chu Lian didn't shove his words back in his face like she had previously done in the army camp. She curled her fingers in his collar as she rested her head against his chest. After a moment, her low, muffled voice resounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren't any words in her reply; just a simple affirmative 'mm' mumbled into his shirt. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The anxiety in He Sanlang's heart instantly transformed into a burst of fireworks, overwhelming him and giving him the urge to fly up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifteen minutes later, He Changdi pulled Chu Lian away from him with his strong arms, tugging her slender body out from his embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was rare for them to have such a warm and peaceful moment, so Chu Lian didn't want to move at all. She looked up with confusion at He Changdi, asking with her soft voice, "What's wrong?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang leaned over to place a kiss on her tender pink lips. "Be good for me and get off the bed first. I'm afraid I won't be able to hold back any longer."</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blush returned in full force to Chu Lian's face and she awkwardly scurried out of his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She put on her embroidered shoes again and straightened out her clothing before shooting a 'fierce' glare at He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm going to find a razor. You have to shave your stubble now." After giving herself a shoddy excuse, Chu Lian turned and made her escape from the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they had finally agreed to be together, even though their following interactions weren't very intimate, it took He Sanlang a lot of effort to control his physical reactions so that it wouldn't cause even more embarrassing incidents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi was a very restrained person in the first place. Although it was hard for him to hold his bodily reactions back, when he thought of how Chu Lian had finally agreed to be with him, this sweet torture felt like nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn't give much thought to their snuggling at all. As a woman, she didn't have much in the way of sexual needs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, she rather enjoyed the sweet closeness they shared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian finally found a razor and returned to the room, He Changdi didn't let her do it for him and shaved his own stubble. Later on, with Chu Lian's help, he wiped down his body and washed his hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't take a bath due to the position of his injuries, so he could only make do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the twenty-seventh had passed, New Year's Eve soon arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a touch of celebration in the air, even in the frigid north.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Liangzhou City was the most festive compared to the other cities nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had gotten up early in the morning to start preparing New Year’s dinner. Wenqing and Wenlan were also so busy that they didn't have any time to rest. In the afternoon, Manager Qin and his subordinates finally returned to the He Estate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan knew that Manager Qin had gone out on Third Young Madam's orders, but they didn't know what exactly he had gone out to do. However, they weren't too curious about it. They knew that anything done on Third Young Madam's instructions was definitely good for their household and good for Third Young Master, so there was nothing for them to worry about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had ordered Wenqing to start cooking a large pot of braised pork in the morning. Wenqing had found it strange and asked, "Third Young Madam, even if we give a whole bowl of this to everyone in this estate, we won't be able to finish this up!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian smiled secretively. "You'll know why when it comes time for dinner."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Chu Lian had already explained it like that, Wenqing dropped her line of questioning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian found it funny. She refused to believe that Captain Guo and the others wouldn't come over to the He Estate to beg off a free meal when faced with such a great excuse.</span></p>
