 <p><strong>Chapter 328: Rumours (7)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xiaoyan stood behind Chu Lian obediently, the corner of her mouth curled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan’s eyes widened. She bit her lip as she tried to control her anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere turned awkward in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, Chu Lian smiled. In a carefree manner, she said, “What are you standing around all dazed for? Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The adjutant quickly added, “Yes, let’s go. It’s cold outside, and it looks like it’s about to start snowing hard. We should return to the tents to warm up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if they hadn’t noticed the party over there at all, the female soldiers in front of the tent continued busying themselves with their chores. While washing the clothes, they even happily chatted amongst each other, occasionally bursting into peals of laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The male adjutant’s rank wasn’t very high. These female soldiers were also General Sima’s subordinates. Even if they bumped into each other on normal days, both the Left Wing and the Right Wing would have to give way to them. He didn’t have any authority to chase those female soldiers away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Honoured Lady Jinyi hadn’t said anything, he couldn't do anything about the female soldiers now, either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The adjutant glanced at the female soldiers from time to time before looking at Chu Lian. His expression turned more and more pained. He had thought that this would be an easy task; who could have known that something like this would happen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to ask for some extra compensation from Captain He later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the party drew closer to the tent, they could hear every word of the female soldiers’ conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing’s expression turned cold. She was about to go up and reprimand them, but Chu Lian held her back with one raised hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Our general treats Captain He really well!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn't that so? Captain He risked his life to save our general the last time they were on the frontlines. It’s only right that our general treats him well."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And I couldn't tell before, but Captain He is so skilled!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you ask me, Captain He and our general are the most perfect match for each other. They were both born in military families. Our general can even assist Captain He in the future." </span></p>
 <p><span style>"But I heard Captain He is already married?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hmph, Captain He's current wife is just some poor noble. How could she compare to our general?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's true. Our general and Captain He are getting along so well. When our general left for the frontlines yesterday, Captain He followed along because he couldn't stop worrying. When the war in the north ends, we might even be able to attend our general's wedding banquet!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop daydreaming and hurry up. We have to finish washing these clothes or the general will punish us when she returns!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>......</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian's brows drew together in a slight frown. It was only after she had finished listening to their conversation that she started walking again and continued heading towards the tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sneered in her heart. Who could have thought that her lunatic husband was so attractive to others?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even General Sima had taken a liking to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian cast a sideways glance at the female adjutant slowly following behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't until they had gotten close enough to see the two female soldiers in front of the tent that the female adjutant seemed to finally 'realise' that they were part of her general's troops. She hurriedly rushed forward to reprimand them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you doing here? Why aren't you at training? You know very well what our rules say, so why haven't you admitted your wrongs yet!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two female soldiers knelt on the ground and trembled after getting scolded by the female adjutant. "This servant is in the wrong! Sister Xiaoyan, we are willing to bear the penalty."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go back to our camp now. It'll be ten smacks of the rod for each of you!" Xiaoyan coldly ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female soldiers acknowledged the orders while trembling. However, they continued kneeling on the ground and refused to get up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaoyan's face turned even more grave. "Why are you still here?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female soldiers exchanged looks before finally gathering up the courage to speak and said, "This servant has committed a wrong and is willing to receive punishment, but Captain He's clothes haven't been washed clean yet. If General finds out, we'll be punished even more."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian blinked as she watched from the side. Had these ladies gotten addicted to acting?</span></p>
