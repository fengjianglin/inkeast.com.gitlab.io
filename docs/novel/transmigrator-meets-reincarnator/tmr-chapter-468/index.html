 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It went without saying that He Changdi absolutely wouldn’t voice those thoughts to his wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While trapped in his embrace, Chu Lian made a silent vow to never wear such an impractical dress again. It was beautiful to look at, but walking in it was just putting herself in trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang was a man of his word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put Chu Lian down by the decorative mountain in front of the corridor. However, he didn’t just walk off straight after. Instead, he helped her straighten out her disheveled clothes before taking her hand and walking to their room in Songtao Court together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Senior Servant Gui caught sight of Third Young Master holding Third Young Madam’s hand, she couldn’t help but smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment He Changdi entered the parlour, he shot a signal at Wenqing, Wenlan, and Senior Servant Zhong with his eyes before pulling Chu Lian towards the bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Senior Servant Gui was about to enter the bedroom with Jingyan behind her to wait upon them, they were held back by Senior Servant Zhong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dear sister, there’s something I need to discuss with you! Let’s just have Wenqing stand guard here for today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Gui glanced at the couple who had just disappeared past the curtains covering the entrance of the bedroom, then back at the smiling Senior Servant Zhong. Realisation dawned upon her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smacked herself on the forehead and admitted with some embarrassment, “Look at how muddle-headed I’ve gotten.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the two senior servants sent away all the other nearby servants in tacit understanding, leaving only Xiyan and Wenqing in case Third Young Master and Madam called.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s face began to heat up uncontrollably the moment she was pulled into the bedroom by He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had a sinking feeling that He Sanlang wasn’t going to let her off tonight…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking of the promise she had made to him back when he was still recovering from his wounds, Chu Lian was both shy and nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had finally managed to get Chu Lian alone in the bedroom with him. There was no way he was going to remain restrained and reserved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At almost the exact moment the curtains fell behind them, Chu Lian was already wrapped tightly in his embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian had a petite figure, so being bound by He Changdi’s arms made her feel like she was being folded into his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her dainty cheek pressed against his chest. She could hear the strong and hurried thumps of his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pace of his heartbeat seemed to be contagious as her heart also started to beat faster without her control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s large palms gently caressed her back, like he was reassuring a panicking kitten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lowered his head and gently kissed her jet-black hair. In a deep voice, he asked, “Lian’er, do you still remember what you promised me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s breathing came to a halt and her grip on his shirt tightened. She gulped nervously before putting on a strong front and mumbling, “Dinner was rather salty tonight. Husband, I want some water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had truly run out of ideas. Otherwise, Chu Lian wouldn’t have used such a crappy excuse to change the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shut her eyes, filled with such embarrassment that she didn’t dare to check his reaction. She hadn’t thought much of it when she had made the promise as she thought that it was something that would be over with in the blink of an eye. However, now that it was actually time to fulfill her promise, she couldn’t help but grow nervous and scared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Chu Lian’s first time in both this life and her last. She had also heard that it would be painful… So, she had suddenly turned into a scaredy cat and would take every opportunity to delay her impending doom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian believed that her words would anger the bipolar He Sanlang. However, who could have thought that, just a moment later, all she would hear was his deep, pleasant laugh from above? With her head on his chest, she could feel him shaking with laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s blush instantly deepened. This guy was actually laughing at her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pushed He Sanlang away in equal parts shame and anger before raising her head to look at his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she saw his smiling eyes, Chu Lian became even more annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He… he was actually laughing at her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not allowed to laugh!”</span></p>
