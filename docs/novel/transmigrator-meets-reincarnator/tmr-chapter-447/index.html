 <p><strong>Chapter 447: News Reaches the Capital (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Through the thin muslin veils, they could see a tall man through the holes in the walls of the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he gave off a gloomy aura, that exquisite face looked like it had been sculpted by the heavens, as if he had come straight out of a painting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had upturned eyes and the space between his brows was slightly wrinkled. His elegant hands moved as if they were plucking at their heartstrings. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was dressed in blue from head to toe, with an azure brocade robe and a darker navy cloak. There was a jade amulet hung at his waist and a crown tied in his hair. He looked like a brilliant, refined nobleman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The way he carried himself dazzled the eyes of most of the ladies there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen was staring with her eyes wide herself, and it took her a long time to regain her senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time she had ever seen such a good-looking man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Excited snippets of chatter filtered into her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Xiao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s the top scholar this year!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Duke Ying must be proud.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen soon found out what that man was called— Xiao Bojian! He had been a talented student in the Imperial College and was now a rising court official!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A promising youth! With looks beyond measure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this short moment, Pan Nianzhen had already fallen for Xiao Bojian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xiao Bojian was on the other side of the courtyard wall, he could still hear the excited discussion of the young ladies. He cast a casual glance their way. The combination of gloom and perfect features was rather contrary, but the noble misses loved that type of air somehow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps due to complete coincidence, Xiao Bojian’s gaze paused in Pan Nianzhen’s direction, only for a second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pan Nianzhen felt her heart leap out of her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly pressed a hand over her heart. Even after Xiao Bojian had taken a seat with his back to them, she was still staring at him dazedly for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caught Royal Princess Duanjia’s attention, and she frowned. “Who is she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her handmaid, Jinxiu, looked to where the princess had focused before leaning down and whispering into her ear, “Replying to Royal Princess, she’s from House Jing’an.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia found that strange. She looked at Jinxiu with confusion in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess, she’s the daughter of the Eldest Madam of House Jing’an, surnamed Pan. This servant heard that she came to the capital from Siyang just two days ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia glanced at Pan Nianzhen once again, her brows still furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She made a mental note of this event and looked towards the courtyard wall as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her next reaction was a light snort. She disliked Xiao Bojian at first sight. He might be slightly better-looking than most men, but he was purposely acting in such a way to tempt young ladies. How shameless!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this was a disguised matchmaking party, there were no further incidents. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The noble misses stayed in Plum Pavilion until it was close to midday, when they were then taken to the banquet by Royal Princess Duanjia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had only been at the lunch banquet for a while when good news came from the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei was seated at the head of the female guests. Although none of the ladies in the inner court of the palace had come today, the Empress Dowager and Empress had each sent their trusted servants over with gifts. They likely hadn’t come so that they wouldn’t overshadow Princess Wei during her birthday party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Senior Servant Lan was whispering something into Princess Wei’s ear with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was done speaking, Princess Wei’s eyes lit up. She beamed happily and nodded. “When did this news arrive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Lan was very happy as well. “The eunuch who delivered the presents from the palace said it himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That meant that the news was practically confirmed and wasn’t just rumour. However, there wasn’t much possibility that it was a rumour anyway. No one would dare to joke with such important matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, the guests seated below had noticed the joy in Princess Wei’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them found it strange. Princess Wei was normally more subdued; even her expressions were controlled. It was rare to see her showing her emotions so openly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now they all wanted to know what it was that her senior servant had whispered to make her so happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Princess Wei’s sisters who understood her the most, in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A middle-aged noble madam dressed in a gorgeous dress, sitting not too far down from the princess, was the first to ask. “I wonder what news has made Your Highness so lively?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei shot a displeased look at the madam who had spoken. “Second Sister-in-Law, are you so afraid that I’ll hide the good news from you?” After saying so, she turned to the hall full of noble ladies, prepared to reveal the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if I didn’t tell you now, I’m sure you’ll find out when you get home today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone exchanged looks, curious about the good news that the princess had mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei calmly smiled. “There was news from the palace that the north has come out victorious in the war with the Tuhuns!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, a cloak of heavy silence fell over the hall. Then, the silence burst, giving way to deafening cheers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some madams even tried using this opportunity to fawn over the princess. “Your Highness must be a lucky person. Such wonderful news came from the palace today! It’s double the blessings for your birthday!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei usually didn’t like this kind of flattery, but she didn’t speak up this time, only sending a reprimanding look at the madam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The happiest person amongst the group of noble madams was Matriarch He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hot tears spilled from her eyes. Out of all her grandsons, the one she had been most worried about was Sanlang. This news elated her, sending her happiness levels soaring through the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could finally have a nice, peaceful new year ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the day of Princess Wei’s birthday, news of the great victory of the northern troops exploded in the capital like fireworks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chengping Emperor was the first to receive the report, of course. He immediately summoned the messenger who had reported the news for a personal audience.</span></p>
