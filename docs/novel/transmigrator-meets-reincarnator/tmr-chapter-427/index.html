 <p><strong>Chapter 427: Cleansing (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time that Chu Lian was celebrating New Year’s in the Great Wu Dynasty. Although it was only going to be the two of them together for the festivities, Chu Lian didn’t feel lonely at all. On the contrary, she was looking forward to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the Kitchen God Festival had ended, time seemed to pass in a flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a blink of an eye, it was already the twenty-seventh, and there were only three more days to New Year’s Eve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day, everyone had to bathe and cleanse themselves. The commoners living in the harsh environment of Liangzhou were no exception, even for the poverty-stricken. They would heat up pots of water and wash themselves with the scraps of soap they had collected in the summer, scrubbing away the filth they accumulated during the year. This was all to ensure that they greeted the new year with a clean body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Early in the morning, Chu Lian was woken up by Wenqing. After washing up in a daze, she listened as Wenqing chattered on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Young Madam, today’s the twenty-seventh, the day of cleansing. This servant has prepared a flower bath for you. After lunch, you should take a bath and wash away your fatigue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even out here in the freezing north, Chu Lian still kept clean. She would take a bath every three days, so she didn’t take much notice of Wenqing’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after putting on her face cream, Chu Lian suddenly remembered the bedridden He Changdi. She asked, “Wenqing, is it an absolute must to go through the cleansing today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing thought that she was interested in the tradition, so she explained with a smile, “Yes, we do. Even the guards watching the doors have to prepare their own baths to wash off the dirt of this year in preparation for the new one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A corner of Chu Lian’s mouth twitched. Didn’t that mean that the patient He Sanlang had to bathe too?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How was he going to bathe with his body covered in scabs!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt a headache coming on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian went to visit the recuperating He Changdi after breakfast. After convalescing for eight days, he was finally able to move his gravely wounded right leg. He no longer needed help from others to sit up or turn over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she entered the outer room, a servant welcomed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Greetings to Third Young Madam.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian nodded to her. “Is my husband awake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servant respectfully answered, “Third Young Master woke up two hours ago. Laiyue has already served Third Young Master his breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian glanced into the room. She found it strange as Laiyue was always the first to welcome her whenever she came looking for He Sanlang, yet he was nowhere to be found.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about Laiyue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Replying to Third Young Madam, Laiyue was sent out on business on Third Young Master’s orders early in the morning. Before he left, he said that he would only be back tomorrow morning.” The servant took out a small wooden box from a cupboard and respectfully held it up with both hands for Chu Lian to inspect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laiyue told this servant to pass on this message to Third Young Madam. Third Young Madam will have to help with changing Third Young Master’s bandages for today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>That clean freak He Sanlang didn’t like others serving him and wasn’t used to having maidservants around him. Other than Chu Lian, only Laiyue was allowed to change his bandages every day. Now that Laiyue wasn’t around, this task had fallen upon Chu Lian’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian suspected that she had walked right into his trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She waved her hand to dismiss the servant and told Wenqing to pick up the medicine box instead. After a short pause, she entered the side room where He Sanlang was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that it was coming close to New Year’s Day, the whole capital was abuzz with activity. It was only in the Jing’an Estate that the atmosphere seemed a little gloomy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The roads to the north had been sealed by the snows, so there wasn’t any news at all. He Erlang was still investigating the corruption case in Zhangzhou with Prince Jin. He had sent a letter back yesterday saying that he might not be able to get back to the capital in time for New Year’s..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matriarch He sat alone in the parlour of Qingxi Hall. Although she was dressed in riches, her silhouette looked pitiful amidst the understated luxury of her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She leaned back in her seat as she stared blankly at the entrance of the parlour, as if there would be someone entering and calling out for her in the next second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Liu came in from the side with some teacups. The sight of the matriarch in this way made her heart heavy with sadness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the He Family was few in number, at least they had Second Young Master and Third Young Master in the estate as well as the two young daughters of the main branch to add a bit of liveliness to their festivities in past years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This year, the main branch was still in pandemonium over the new concubine, and the countess was bedridden and unable to attend the celebrations. They had been holding expectations of a new family member to join them after He Sanlang had married his wife, but fate had dashed their hopes. Sanlang and his wife were now out there in the north, and they didn’t even know if they were faring well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matriarch heard Senior Servant Liu’s movements and briefly came to life. She touched the side of her head where her hair was turning more and more white as the days passed. “Do you think this old woman chose wrongly by letting Lian’er go to the north?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Senior Servant Liu let the matriarch beat herself over this? The matriarch had spent so many days worrying that her body’s condition had deteriorated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Liu quickly consoled her. “What are you saying, Matriarch? The roads from the northern border have been blocked; there’s no way for us to know anything! Perhaps Third Young Master and Third Young Madam are actually preparing to celebrate New Year’s over there instead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of guilt rose in Matriarch He’s heart. “It’s all my fault, I didn’t think it through enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As master and servant were speaking, Muxiang suddenly entered in a panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Servant Liu put on a stern expression. “Is this how a personal handmaid should be acting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muxiang paused and quickly collected herself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Speak!” the matriarch ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Muxiang gulped before stammering out, “Matriarch, many of the noble houses we’ve sent New Year gifts have returned them to us untouched!”</span></p>
