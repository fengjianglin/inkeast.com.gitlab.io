 <p><strong>Chapter 614: Phoenix Trap (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that He Erlang had finally woken up, Royal Princess Duanjia could finally set her worries to rest. However, on the outside, she haughtily raised her chin at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sneered and said, “So you still recognise that it’s me, huh? He Erlang, if I wasn’t here, you would have likely been sold off into slavery without even knowing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia glared as she scolded He Erlang. Even her hands were subconsciously placed on her waist, as if that could make her look more intimidating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his vision cleared, He Changjue’s mind also cleared up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something in his field of view caught his attention. He squinted at it, then got up and poured all of the teapot’s cold water onto that thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hissing sound resounded in the room, followed by a small amount of green smoke. The incense burner had been extinguished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia was completely caught off guard by his sudden action and dropped the haughty attitude that she had been taking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shocked and slightly frightened, she asked, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something wrong with this incense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” With widened eyes, Royal Princess Duanjia’s attention shifted towards the octagonal incense pot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue pulled Royal Princess Duanjia to his side. “Don’t get too close to it; I don’t know if it has any effect on women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue’s tug made Duanjia stumble. She nearly fell into his embrace, which made her blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She clenched the hems of her sleeves tightly before asking, “Were you unable to wake up because of that incense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a special type of incense. It usually caused no harm, and it was even good for the body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if a man were to drink a specially concocted wine beforehand, the scent would cause him to faint and stimulate his lustful desires.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had heard people talking about it back in the Dragon Guard, but he had never actually seen it. He never expected that he would be on the receiving end of it today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue had been on duty today. He had been leading his men on patrol around the imperial gardens, but he had been lured by a figure in black to this unused palace hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he entered the room and caught a whiff of the incense, it was already too late for him to do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Royal Princess Duanjia managed to wake him up by dousing cold water over his face. Otherwise, no matter how much she shouted, he would’ve been useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he were woken up, he would have turned into an uncontrollable, lustful fiend if he continued breathing in the incense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had managed to extinguish it early he wasn’t too affected. Right now, he just felt an uncomfortable heat inside, and little Erlang was trying to show its presence, but this was still at a bearable level for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the room was dimly lit, it was most likely that Duanjia wouldn’t notice the change in his body that was out of his control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Erlang helped Royal Princess Duanjia up. He thought about the situation, and realised that they had walked straight into a trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia sat up straight, while He Erlang stayed right beside her. She seemed to be able to smell He Changjue’s distinctively manly scent all around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue took off his cloak and covered Duanjia’s shoulders with it before asking, “Where are your servants?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia couldn’t possibly have come here just by herself. Even if someone had deliberately baited her to come, she couldn’t possibly have come without a single servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s been taken down,” Royal Princess Duanjia said calmly, but He Changjue could tell that she was actually worried inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Erlang recalled the maid who frequently helped to deliver letters between the two of them. He reached out with the intention to console Duanjia by stroking her head, but then at the last minute, he recalled the fact that there was no official relationship between them and awkwardly retracted his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She should be fine. I was their target, so that girl’s life shouldn’t be at risk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia glanced at him and twisted her lips to one side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue’s pupils shrunk. “Let’s wait and see. I want to see just who is trying to plot against me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia was frightened by the abrupt change in his expression. The ferocious snarl on his face made her mind go blank. She had never known that He Erlang could be so decisive and authoritative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A slight smile subconsciously formed on her lips. This man was becoming more and more attractive to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While He Changjue was lost in his thoughts, Royal Princess Duanjia unscrupulously inspected his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them had never been so close to each other before!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could touch the large palm he had placed on the bedside just by reaching out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hand was huge. Just judging from what she could see, it seemed to be twice the size of hers. His fingers were long, and if he spread his palm out and she put her hand on it, he would probably be able to wrap over her entire hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were some fine hairs on the back of his hand. His skin wasn’t very dark, but its colour looked very manly. At the very least, it was completely different from hers, which was soft and tender.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite being in a dangerous situation like this, Royal Princess Duanjia’s heart was overflowing with happiness, because she was slowly discovering the tiny differences between their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her line of sight shifted a little, and her eyes immediately widened. Her face grew red and she turned away. She couldn’t continue letting her gaze roam over him anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling that Duanjia’s gaze had finally shifted away, He Erlang was finally able to relax.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually, he wouldn’t mind her looking at all; it wasn’t as if he would lose something if she stared. Besides, she was the person he liked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the current situation was different. He was in an awkward state due to the incense which had triggered something in his body which he couldn’t control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changjue shifted a little to get more comfortable, trying to hide his uncomfortable bulge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right as he was about to say something, he suddenly heard some sounds coming from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian and Wenqing had arrived.</span></p>
