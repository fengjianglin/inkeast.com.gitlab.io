 <p><strong>Chapter 625: Spring Hunt (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was out of Chu Lian’s expectations that He Sanlang would say something like that at this time. She had already forgotten about the brazen words that He Changdi had said to her earlier in front of the remote palace hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under these circumstances, she seriously couldn’t remember what she had promised He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian innocently blinked. “What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s handsome face turned gloomy. He got up and swiftly walked to Chu Lian’s side. Then, he trapped her between himself and the dressing table with his long arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang bent down. They were so close, &nbsp;they could practically feel each other’s breaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s cheeks unconsciously flushed as she looked into his deep eyes. She felt a mix of embarrassed and annoyed at him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She pulled back slightly, putting some distance between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever Chu Lian retreated a little, He Changdi would move closer. In the end, Chu Lian’s entire back was up against the dressing table. She was unable to distance herself from He Sanlang, and the atmosphere between them turned suggestive instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The handmaids who were on duty inside the bedroom had already tactfully left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi stared at her. When he spoke, she could feel his warm, clear breath on her face. Chu Lian was blushing with shyness when she heard him ask, “Do you remember now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt uneasy because it seemed as if he was able to see into the depths of her heart. She subconsciously looked away, not daring to make eye contact with his ink-black eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian feigned ignorance. She really hadn’t remembered the promise she made to He Changdi at the remote palace hall, but now...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone would be able to guess with a single glance the kind of thoughts her voracious husband was currently having. Thus, she was going with the oblivious route.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t stupid. He Changdi was often insatiable when he wanted her. Chu Lian had been scared off intimacy with him after the last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang stared at her evasive gaze, then suddenly smiled with a strange curve to his lips. He lowered his voice and whispered, “Are you sure you don’t understand? Lian’er, I’ll give you one more chance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s entire body trembled. The devilish expression that had suddenly appeared on He Changdi’s face made her somewhat edgy, but she was already at the point of no return with her charade. She couldn’t screw up at this critical moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She bit her lips, blinked her watery eyes, and firmly said, “I really don’t know. He Changdi, you must have remembered it wrongly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, her tender earlobe was immediately held within his warm, humid mouth. The sensation of it sent tingles through her whole body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s eyes widened because of He Changdi’s actions. Her hands reached out in an attempt to push him away and cover her sensitive ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang was able to pull Chu Lian’s hand away from her eyes by exerting a little force with his slender fingers. He propped himself up with one hand on the dressing table, then used his other hand to capture her two slender wrists. He rained kisses on her tender earlobes and neck before continuing downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was held completely under his control. She didn’t even have the leeway to struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All she could do was retort with her mouth, “He Changdi, stop it! I want to take a bath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? There’s no hurry. I’ll help you recover your memory first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was furious. “How is this supposed to help recover my memory?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her nagging little mouth was soon attacked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang lifted Chu Lian’s delicate figure onto the dressing table. It took Chu Lian a few moments before she could even react. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He leaned against her as his large hand wandered all over her body on a dangerous path. Chu Lian’s entire body felt limp and weak. He bent down beside her ear and asked, “Do you remember now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian seriously wanted to cry. At this point, she didn’t dare to say that she didn’t remember. She looked towards He Changdi with pleading eyes and nodded pitifully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi saw that the little woman in his arms had finally admitted defeat, so he immediately started the battle to satisfy Chu Lian…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian didn’t think that he would really go for it, even after she surrendered. She seriously wanted to die right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She resisted the urge to moan and firmly bit onto her red lips. She glared at him with watery eyes and complained with a shaky voice, “I’ve already admitted my fault…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi lowered his head and dropped kisses down her beautiful collarbone with his thin lips. His voice was hoarse yet restrained as he said, “Since you made a mistake, you should be punished!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang had already attacked her delicate lips before Chu Lian even got the chance to finish speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, the young couple didn’t get to the bathroom until an hour later. This also meant that the tub of hot water prepared in the study had become completely unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi carried the worn-out Chu Lian directly to their bedroom, then straight into the bathroom inside it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian leaned against He Sanlang’s sturdy chest, sulking with a pout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi didn’t mind at all; in fact, he felt refreshed. Since he was fully content, there was nothing wrong with yielding to his wife now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With one hand wrapped around Chu Lian’s slender waist, his other resting on the edge of the bathtub, He Changdi closed his eyes and laid back to relax.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian sulked by herself for a while, but she felt that it was pointless when He Changdi didn’t even react to her pouting. She turned around slightly and used her index finger to jab at He Changdi’s muscular chest. “He Changdi, I’ve already fulfilled your request. We don’t owe each other anything now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi opened his deep eyes and narrowed them dangerously. He looked at his wife who was lying within his embrace, her face flushed from the hot steam, and said, “What do you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian gave him a glare. If she wasn’t being held within He Changdi’s embrace right now, she would have definitely placed her hands on her waist in an imposing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve already fulfilled the promise I made with you! You can’t use that matter to threaten me again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi glanced at her and smirked. “Who said that was my request? I’ve already told you earlier, that was a punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He Sanlang, don’t push your luck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He… He had done it twice just now! Even if the first time was considered a punishment, then the second time should have been enough to fulfill her promise!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he be so shameless?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s chest was heaving due to anger. He Changdi’s gaze narrowed at the sight of her moving chest, which was partially covered by the flower petals within the tub.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the pitiful Honoured Lady Jinyi didn’t get to sleep until late at night in order to fulfill her promise. &nbsp;</span></p>
