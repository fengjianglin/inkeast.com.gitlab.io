 <p><strong>Chapter 81:&nbsp;Can't Dodge Disaster (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This chapter has been stolen from volarenovels. Please read from the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong was about to come over to help Chu Lian out. Upon seeing Imperial Princess Leyao leading the rest of her party away, she heaved a great sigh of relief. However, without waiting for her to relax, a sharp scream filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ahhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt someone push her hard and she wobbled. Following that, some sweet-smelling things fell over her and rolled all over the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian froze in shock. When she looked down, she noticed that there were some longevity peach buns scattered all over the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who had knocked into her was already on her knees, wailing and crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt the urge to roll her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of noble ladies hadn't gone too far. Their attention was attracted by the new commotion, so they started to turn around to look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The madams and young ladies surrounding Chu Lian all moved away, leaving a clear path for the noble ladies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Zou Yuanqin spotted the longevity peach buns all over the ground, her calm demeanour cracked and she quickly walked over. She pointed at Chu Lian while trembling in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You! How could you destroy the birthday present my mother prepared for my grandfather!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Birthday present?</span></p>
 <p><span style>These ugly longevity peach buns?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady, stop pulling my leg. Isn't this trap you've made way too obvious?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Zou Yuanqin's shout, someone in the crowd exclaimed. "Look at the shape of the buns! These must have been made by Mr Wang from De'an Restaurant! They were destroyed just like that! What a waste!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corners of Chu Lian's mouth twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These half-grown ladies were not just using a plate of longevity peach buns to sabotage her. They were even praising these buns like they were made by some master chef! What were they trying to pull? What happened to the 'pushed into water' trap she had been expecting in the novel?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How did the trap become even more... stupid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those lumps on the floor were just some white steamed buns dyed a little red. How could they be some top-class longevity peach buns made by some amazing chef?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Please, don't joke around with me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the crowd couldn't possibly hear Chu Lian's inner ranting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd parted again and a richly dressed forty-year-old madam walked out. When Chu Lian looked at her, the madam's sharp gaze shot back at her. With anger rumbling in her tone, she questioned, "What's going on here!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Heir Dingyuan's wife, Madam Huang, whom Madam Zou had brought her to greet earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was also Zou Yuanqin's mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person kneeling on the ground, trembling, was a maidservant dressed in a ginger-coloured dress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a wavering voice, she said, "This... this servant was sending the longevity peach buns to the banquet at the outer court when... this young madam suddenly pushed this servant. Madam, please have mercy on this servant! Please have mercy!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian: ......</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been standing still right here, how could she have pushed her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, no one stood out to speak for her at this time. To the noble madams and young ladies here, she had already climbed the social ladder by marrying into House Jing'an. He Changdi's sudden departure so soon after the marriage had then made her the hot topic of the season. Most of the people here were probably waiting to see her commit a faux pas. Even if they knew that she was being framed, not a single one would stand out for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the one trying to put her down seemed to be Heir Dingyuan's wife. It might even be the Emperor's most favoured child, Imperial Princess Leyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong stopped in her tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Su gaped a little in shock. After blanking out for a moment, she finally recovered her senses. She turned to her sister-in-law and said, "Eldest Sister-in-Law, we... we..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't say a word! We'll wait!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong felt the urge to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously, when Imperial Princess Leyao had been purposely mocking Chu Lian, the princess was the one at fault. If she went up to defend Chu Lian, that was perfectly reasonable. Even if she made an enemy of the princess then, the news of her good deed and righteous defense of her family would spread out. However, it was a completely different situation now. She hadn't clearly seen what happened. It didn't matter who the culprit was, anyway. Madam Huang's gift to Old Marquis Dingyuan for his longevity feast had been ruined, so it was now all Chu Lian's fault. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If she went out now, she had to face both Madam Huang and Imperial Princess Leyao. There wouldn't be any merit to her reputation, and she might even be labelled as someone who tried to cover up her family's faults.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madam Rong was already low enough in the ranks of noble madams. She was also in charge of managing the Ying Household. House Ying's descent had slowly moulded her into someone who would seek profit and avoid all losses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Su desperately looked at the crowd, and was about to make her way forward when Madam Rong held her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eighth Miss, Miss Yuan, hid behind Madam Rong and watched. Hidden in the shadows, her lips curled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Bojian stood outside the corridor, his right hand gripping the red painted railing tightly as his gaze fixed upon the scene across the pond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heir Zheng used the folding fan in his hands to block the sun shining from above and carelessly said, "Senior Xiao, it seems like something must have happened over there. Even the Princess is around! It looks quite lively."</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the third floor of Qingfeng Court, the smell of hardwood incense filled the area. There was practically no one around, and it was extremely peaceful and serene. The window facing the pond was only opened halfway, and from that small opening, a tall person could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had sharp features, and a pair of azure eyes that were currently focused on Mei Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man waved his hand and a human figure appeared next to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, what are your orders?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go over to Mei Court. If they try to punish Miss Chu, save her." </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Understood."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The figure disappeared in a flash.</span></p>
