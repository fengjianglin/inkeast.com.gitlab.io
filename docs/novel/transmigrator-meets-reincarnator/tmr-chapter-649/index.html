 <p><strong>Chapter 649: Caring Old Brother (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The imperial hunting grounds were surrounded by beautiful scenery, with mountains, waters, and forests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Chu Lian was injured, the emperor allowed her to stay in her tent to rest. She didn’t need to participate in any activities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who were injured were probably the idlest within the entire camp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing had informed her that, while she was still sleeping, some people had come to check on her situation, such as Old Duke Zheng, Sima Hui, and Captain Guo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sima Hui had also left behind a maidservant, who was skilled in medicine. Chu Lian walked to the lakeside nearby with Wenqing’s support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was something that she couldn’t understand. Why was her husband, He Changdi, whom she needed the most, still missing? Even people like Sima Hui, Captain Guo, and Xiao Hongyu had come to express their concern when they found out about her accident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She took a deep breath of the refreshingly cool spring air to suppress the resentment in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the emperor hadn’t made arrangements for the officials who came, then she really wanted to rush to He Changdi and ask about his current thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was seriously frustrated right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he was dissatisfied with her, they still had to meet each other to make things clear. What was he trying to do by avoiding her?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned around and instructed Wenlan, “Go inquire about Imperial Princess Leyao’s situation. Also, check if my husband is over at her side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Chu Lian finished speaking, she heard the sound of a woman’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian turned around and looked towards the direction of that voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw them at the lakeside about fifty to sixty meters away. A man in a black robe with an icy face and a sword strapped at his waist was walking beside a young girl sitting in a wooden wheelchair. There were five maidservant and court attendants behind the young girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who else could they be other than He Changdi and Imperial Princess Leyao?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s clear eyes narrowed slightly. She stared at He Changdi and Imperial Princess Leyao, who were currently taking a stroll beside the lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mouth tilted upwards into a mocking smirk. The inner radiance on her beautiful face dimmed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So it turned out that He Changdi had been avoiding her because he was accompanying the injured Imperial Princess Leyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Well, she really learned something from that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan, who were standing behind Chu Lian, also frowned when they saw the scene in front of them. They couldn’t understand what Third Young Master was doing right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When had he became so close with Imperial Princess Leyao?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi had a cold expression on his face. With narrowed eyes and a bottomless gaze, it was hard to tell what he was thinking about. When looking carefully, he seemed to have two dark smudges under his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly sensed a familiar gaze on him. The moment he raised his head to look, he met with Chu Lian’s astounded gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi’s eyebrows instantly furrowed and a flash of pain appeared within his eyes when he looked at Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He leaned forward slightly, wanting to run over to her immediately, but he suddenly thought of something and stopped himself from moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took in a deep breath and suppressed the raging impulse within himself. Then, he turned his eyes away coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of the corner of Chu Lian’s eyes, she could see Imperial Princess Leyao revealing a jeering and proud smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian controlled her emotions and forced out a faint smile. She bobbed a greeting toward Imperial Princess Leyao from afar, then resolutely turned around and left without looking back again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenqing and Wenlan, who were following behind Chu Lian, were also infuriated. They positioned themselves on either side of Chu Lian so they completely blocked Chu Lian’s figure, making sure that the people behind them couldn’t see her at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian returned to the tent, she went back into the bed to sulk. She had originally wanted to go out to get some fresh air, but she hadn’t expected that it would make her feel even more frustrated instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damn it, He Changdi was seriously so toxic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shortly afterwards, Wenqing reported the information that she had found regarding Imperial Princess Leyao’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she mentioned Imperial Princess Leyao’s injury, Chu Lian didn’t feel any sympathy for her at all. There was even a faint sense of delight within her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Princess Leyao had been hostile towards her since the first time she entered the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her hostility had become even more obvious nowadays.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She still didn’t understand He Changdi’s intentions. Although Imperial Princess Leyao was still very young, her intentions were clear. Did He Sanlang really want to become the emperor’s son-in-law and marry a princess?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Wu Dynasty wasn’t the same as the previous dynasty. A princess’s husband wouldn’t be given any actual power. If he married the emperor’s daughter, then he would just become an idle plaything waiting for death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s mind was in a jumbled mess. The hunting ground was located in the outskirts of the capital, the weather lagged slightly behind the capital. It was still pretty cold at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had ridden all the way here, then suffered a fright yesterday. Thus, she hadn’t gotten a good night’s rest last night. Chu Lian had obviously become thinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked pale and haggard now. It seemed like all the previous nourishing for her body had been for naught.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan’s heart seriously ached. She and her sister knew some martial arts, so they would usually be responsible for taking care of Chu Lian when she goes out. However, Xiyan was definitely the maidservant whom Third Young Madam trusted the most within the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The night before they had departed, Xiyan had specially told them to take good care of Third Young Madam’s health. Senior Servant Zhong had also left some words for them in particular.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, Third Young Madam’s health had become better and the young couple had a loving relationship. It was entirely possible that there was already a young heir in her belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Well, look at what happened now. Not only Third Young Madam had not gained any weight, but she had even become thinner than before…</span></p>
