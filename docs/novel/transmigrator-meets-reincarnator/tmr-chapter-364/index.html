 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he wasn't waiting for Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chu Lian of this lifetime seemed to be a whole other person from the previous one, and He Sanlang's feelings for her were growing the more he interacted with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, He Changdi had never thought that Chu Lian might have a solution for the border troops' situation. In his eyes, as clever and cunning as Chu Lian was, she wasn't capable enough to take on the burden of helping the border troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he only had a rough understanding of what had happened in this war from his previous life, He Changdi had already managed to cheat death once. He wouldn't be so silly as to sit and wait for his second death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he saw the border troops' situation for himself, He Changdi grew worried. He understood that his preparations were far from enough. It might still be able to help the border troops out of trouble for the time being, but it wouldn't be able to treat the root of their problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It hadn't been that long since He Changdi had come to the border, so it was already pretty impressive that he had been able to take some preemptive measures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Captain, it looks like there's someone over there!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi's thoughts were pulled back into reality by the guards on duty. His gaze lifted and focused on the swirling snow in the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wind-propelled snow blocked most of his vision, but he could still make out the vague outline of a party of men and horses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi's eyes shone with life, and the eternal ice that covered his face seemed to melt a little. He signalled the soldiers up on the watchtower and began to stride towards it himself. When he reached the foot of the tower, he shouted for his personal guards and mounted his horse. In a short moment, He Changdi was already leading his soldiers out of the main camp and sprinting towards the barely visible group of people in front. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards on the watchtower waved a small red flag and made a few signals towards the camp. The soldiers on patrol immediately informed their leaders, rousing the camp. Barely a few moments later, a few hundred people had charged out of the camp, hot on the heels of He Sanlang. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he even reached the group trudging through the snow, He Changdi leaped from his horse, making a somersault before landing soundly right in front of the leader of the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only after they had drawn close that He Changdi's guards finally saw that it was a merchant caravan they were facing. They formed a long line of men with twenty or more carriages following behind. The carriages were clearly used for transport and loaded down with goods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards' eyes lit up the moment they realised what the caravan was transporting. They couldn't resist gulping down some drool. This... this carriage couldn't possibly be transporting... food?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They hadn't been able to eat their fill for many days by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leader of the caravan was seated at the front of the first carriage. He was completely wrapped up in a fur cloak and topped off with a fur hat, such that only his eyes could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, his gaze had also landed on He Sanlang. The caravan leader stumbled off the carriage and almost fell into the snow. With staggering steps, he ran towards He Changdi and made it in front of him in just two strides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The caravan leader immediately kneeled down without a care for the snow that had already reached his calves. "Third Young Master, this servant has finally returned!” he wailed. “This servant hasn't failed you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue's voice was hoarse and dry; even the skin on his face had cracked up from the harsh winds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He completely disregarded his image and sobbed his heart out, snot and tears free-flowing down his face, making an absolutely pitiful picture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi felt that his manservant was being ridiculous, but his heart was filled with warmth. He hadn't trusted the wrong person this lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright, alright. Get up. Don't tell me you're planning to sleep here overnight in the snow?" While He Sanlang still spoke rather coldly, everyone could sense the unusual amount of care in his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue immediately scrambled up. He roughly brushed away the tears left on his face before pulling down the fur hood wrapped around his neck. It was only then that He Sanlang could finally see his manservant's face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After so many months apart, Laiyue's originally chubby face had slimmed down. He looked a little more mature than he was before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, with his disheveled stubble, dry and cracked lips, as well as frost-reddened skin, Laiyue didn't make for a pretty picture. His heart had been in his throat for the whole journey here to the north with the supply caravan. Now that he had finally accomplished his mission, it was as if a great burden had been lifted from his heart. He smiled like a silly fool at He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for He Changdi's guards, when they heard what their captain and the wretched-looking man before them had said, their jaws dropped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite his appearance, the leader of the caravan was one of their captain's subordinates?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn't that mean that all of the supplies in this caravan were meant for the border camp?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards couldn't hide their joy at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The winds were harsh and snow was beating on their faces. It was cold and painful, but the hearts of the soldiers were brimming with warmth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi gave out straightforward orders and had his personal guards take over the supply caravan that Laiyue had brought. He told Laiyue to get on a horse and follow him back to the main camp to report the good news first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laiyue knew that time was of the essence, so he gathered up the last of his strength. On the way back to the camp, he explained everything he had done to He Changdi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Third Young Master, this servant followed your orders and bought supplies near the Yueqin Mountains. Even after two months, this servant was only able to gather up 200,000kg of food. When we were crossing the border into Liangzhou, we were attacked by barbarians and we lost around 20,000kg of our supplies. Taking away the supplies we used on the journey here, we only had 150,000kg worth left by the time we came to the heart of Liangzhou."</span></p>
 <p><span style>150,000kg of food! If they went by the normal amount of army rations, it would only be enough to feed fifty thousand troops for six to seven days. Even in these extreme circumstances, it wouldn't last more than ten days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The border troops were already running out of supplies. This 150,000kg of food could only buy them a few more days- they weren’t out of the danger zone yet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to find another way!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Changdi's hands curled up into fists so tight that he almost snapped his reins!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gazed at the camp in the distance with unreadable eyes and a resolute expression, cheering himself on in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was no longer the He Changdi of the past. He was going to find a way to get the border troops out of this crisis!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current snowstorm was likely to last for another month. They had to survive this month somehow and mount a counterattack to take down the Tuhuns once and for all!</span></p>
