 <p><strong>Chapter 479: Early Morning (4)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang had a cold expression on his face, but his voice was hoarse. “Be good. I’ll accompany you to greet Grandmother after you apply the medicine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ahem…. He had done a careful inspection while cleaning her up last night. That area was red and swollen because he had been too reckless...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian wailed and covered her head with the blanket. She felt too ashamed to face anyone else right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>About twenty minutes later, Chu Lian was still curled up in the blanket, covering her flushed face. She slowly calmed down as she listened to the sound of water coming from the bathroom. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang had actually ignored her opposition and personally applied the medicine for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It served him right that he had to take a cold bath, Chu Lian thought angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, she called Wenlan and Fuyan in to help her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was still feeling somewhat uncomfortable, so she awkwardly walked about after getting off the bed. It took a few rounds around the bedroom before she got used to the strange new feeling. Wenlan was keeping a happy smile hidden beneath her lowered head, but the look in Fuyan’s downcast eyes were filled with envy and jealousy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Changdi came out of the bathroom wearing a loose robe, before Wenlan could walk up to him, Fuyan had already beaten her to it and handed him the dry towel in her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She attempted to reach out and help him dry his dark hair, but He Sanlang cast a cold gaze over the two maidservants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan immediately bobbed towards her two masters and turned to leave. When she noticed that Fuyan was still standing there in a daze, she grabbed Fuyan’s hand and dragged her out before Third Young Master got angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they got to the outer room, Fuyan angrily flung off Wenlan’s hand and scolded her. “Wenlan, what are you doing?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan took a deep breath and glared at Fuyan. “Fuyan, can’t you tell? Third Young Master doesn’t like us staying in there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuyan snorted. “You’re just being overly cautious! Third Young Master didn’t even say anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan’s brows furrowed even more when she heard her reply. “Fuyan, I’m going to give you some advice. Even if you came as part of Third Young Madam’s dowry, you still need to know your place. Remember Mingyan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenlan turned and left the outer room after leaving her warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was starting to dislike Fuyan more and more. Did Fuyan really think Third Young Madam was an idiot? Although Third Young Madam was usually very kind and friendly and didn’t like to make a fuss over small matters, that didn’t mean that she was naive and easily fooled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they didn’t have a Third Young Madam, did Fuyan seriously think that Third Young Master was someone she could afford to provoke?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuyan hadn’t gone to the northern border with them, so she hadn’t seen how many people Third Young Master had killed on the battlefields. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have had these presumptuous thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuyan couldn’t care less about Wenlan’s warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Young Master might be treating Third Young Madam as sweet as honey right now, but wait until he learns about Third Young Madam’s betrayal! Once he finds out about her dalliance with another man, there was bound to be a trace of doubt in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No man can stand a woman’s betrayal, especially if she was his wife!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuyan smirked. She had been waiting for so long. Wasn’t it all for this day?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s expression finally softened once the two handmaids left the inner room. He walked over to Chu Lian and handed her the towel in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian rolled her eyes before taking it. She got up and made him sit on the stool in front of the dressing table. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She moved to his back and started gently drying off his wet hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weren’t Wenlan and Fuyan around just now?” Chu Lian asked with a slight pout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Sanlang’s dark eyes looked at Chu Lian through the bronze mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice was cold and stiff as he said, “I don’t like them serving me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian couldn’t help smiling as she recalled what Senior Servant Zhong had told her before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she had married He Changdi, Songtao Court didn’t have any ranked maidservants at all. There had only been a few menial servants responsible for cleaning. He Changdi’s basic needs had always been handled by Laiyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t know how to serve others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was speaking the truth. She really didn’t know how to take care of others. After experiencing the luxury of maidservants at her beck-and-call, her actions naturally couldn’t compare...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humour shone in He Changdi’s deep eyes. “I need you to take care of me, except in bed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian was stunned by his words. Her face instantly flushed and she threw the towel at He Changdi. If he didn’t need her help, then he could do it himself!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian felt that just throwing the towel at him wasn’t enough, so she also shot a glare at him. What was wrong with this He Sanlang? Ever since their relationship had progressed to the next step, he had been constantly making dirty jokes. How annoying!</span></p>
