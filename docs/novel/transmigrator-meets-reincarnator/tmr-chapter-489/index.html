 <p><strong>Chapter 489: Fox Fur Capes (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">This story is completely free to read on volarenovels~ Please support my translations on the original source!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Royal Princess Duanjia finished speaking, Princess Wei shot her a glare and took Chu Lian’s hand to reassure her. “Don’t worry, although Tai’er is a little mischievous, he’s not malicious. Marquis Anyuan will be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although that was what Princess Wei was saying, she hoped inwardly that her youngest son could teach He Sanlang a lesson and make him understand his role. Even though Chu Lian’s maiden family couldn’t be counted on, she still had Princess Wei to stand up for her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The topic was glossed over just like that. Royal Princess Duanjia was all smiles as she sidled up to Chu Lian and said, “Chu Liu, didn’t you say you brought something new to eat? Why haven’t you taken it out yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian’s lips unconsciously lifted into a smile and she instructed Xiyan and Wenlan to bring the food in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cloth-wrapped package and a food container were soon placed on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian opened the package personally and took out two bright red capes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia had discerning eyes and were able to tell that the capes Chu Lian were holding were made of top-quality red fox fur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia was startled by the sight. “Chu Liu, where did you get these?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two capes had slightly different designs and Chu Lian gave one to each princess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I brought these back from the north. I was lucky enough to happen upon these fox pelts, so I had them made into capes for Your Highness and Princess Duanjia.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red fox pelts were even more rare than white fox pelts in the Great Wu Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two capes that Chu Lian had brought were sleek and practically perfect, making them almost priceless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia immediately draped it over her shoulders and twirled around to show it off. “Mother, look! Isn’t this pretty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei glared at her before ‘scolding’ Chu Lian. “These furs are too valuable! I’ll accept them this time, but you’re not allowed to spend so much on gifts in the future.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian froze up a little and her face took on a tinge of embarrassment. “Your Highness, I actually didn’t spend that much…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The way she spoke piqued their curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much is not that much?” Royal Princess Duanjia asked to satisfy the itch in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian displayed one slender finger in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia guessed, “A ten-thousand tael note?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corners of Chu Lian’s mouth twitched and she coughed before shaking her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten thousand taels? She hadn’t even had five thousand taels up in the north...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia covered her mouth in shock. “Don’t tell me it was a hundred thousand taels!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not at all,” Chu Lian replied awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei was also watching curiously. Finally, she sent a glare to her daughter first before stating, “It can’t be a hundred thousand taels, even our estate doesn’t have that much. I’m afraid Jinyi must mean a thousand taels.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What! A thousand taels?! Isn’t that a steal? Chu Liu, your luck is ridiculously good! A thousand taels for these two fox pelts of such great quality... What a huge bargain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia bit her handkerchief in jealousy, wondering why she didn’t have that sort of luck too. Whenever she played the gambling card game Madiao with her mother, she would lose terribly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chuckle escaped from Chu Lian, which she quickly turned into a cough. “Your Highness, it’s not a thousand taels, but a hundred catties of brown rice…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These red fox furs had been traded for grain and food by a barbarian in the simple market she had opened in the north. One of the workers there had reported the furs to Manager Qin, who had then sent them over to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Lian finished speaking, Royal Princess Duanjia wailed and threw herself at Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Liu, what kind of crazy luck do you have?! Let me have some of it! Aren’t you breaking the laws of heaven with your luck?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei didn’t know how to reply to her daughter’s silly exclamation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian hadn’t even mentioned the new northern trade market to Princess Wei, but the two red fox fur capes alone were enough to make them all jealous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear how profitable the market was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guilin Restaurant’s income was now a paltry sum compared to the sky-high profits that the northern market was bringing in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how cheap the two red fox fur capes had been, Princess Wei and Royal Princess Duanjia were still touched by the gifts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t due to the value, but due purely to the sentiment behind the gifts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian opened up the box of food and took out an exquisite porcelain plate. “These are some hawthorn balls I made yesterday. Your Highness, Princess, please try them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Princess Duanjia loved eating Chu Lian’s novel treats the most. She immediately picked up one of the balls and stuffed it into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sweet, yet mellow sugared ball melted in her mouth. When she bit into it, there was a burst of sourness that complemented the sweetness. There weren’t any cores or seeds inside, so she could swallow it down right after chewing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sweet, sour, delicious, and easy to eat. Royal Princess Duanjia wanted to eat another one immediately after finishing the first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei took one to taste as well, and praised Chu Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a marvelous taste this little candied fruit has. It’s sour and sweet at the same time and very appetising. But this doesn’t seem to taste like hawthorns?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Lian hadn’t expected Princess Wei to be able to tell the difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She nodded and said, “Your Highness is right. Although I call this dessert ‘hawthorn balls’, they’re not actually made from hawthorns.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t good for pregnant women to eat too much hawthorn, so Chu Lian had kept that in mind while making this confection. She had swapped out the hawthorns for a special fruit she had found in the north called ‘gooseberries’, which looked and tasted very similar to hawthorns. However, their medicinal uses were entirely different from hawthorns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they finished their desserts, the imperial physician that Princess Wei had called for arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had sent for an imperial physician skilled in treating external wounds. Once Doctor Min had taken Chu Lian’s pulse and declared her to be completely healthy, Princess Wei was finally able to relax and set aside her worries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Doctor Min left, Royal Princess Duanjia pulled Chu Lian off to cook roast duck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Wei had no choice but to let them go, sending one last glare at Royal Princess Duanjia.</span></p>

 <p><strong>TL Note:</strong> Madiao is a gambling card game that was popular during the Qing Dynasty. There's a Wikipedia article on it:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madiao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madiao</a></p>
 <p>The author also left a note about the 'gooseberries', stating that she borrowed the name of a real-life fruit, but otherwise invented its medicinal properties for the sake of the story :)</p>
 <p>This is what the real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physalis_peruviana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'cape gooseberries'</a> look like:</p>

 <p>I've seen these on cakes and I actually thought they were fake before! Never tried eating one though, so I don't know what they taste like XD</p>
