 <p><strong><u>Chapter 739: Qingshan</u></strong></p>
 <p>This time around, Xiao Yan did not drag things out. After accounting to Xiao Ding and Xiao Li about this matter, he found Zi Yan in the mansion and brought her along as he quietly left.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was bringing Zi Yan along and was just about to leave the empire quickly using his Dou Qi wings to travel when Zi Yan by his side pulled his sleeve. Her little hand pointed in front of them and laughed with a clear voice, “Cai Lin jie (older sister) is there.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was immediately startled when he heard these words. He hurriedly threw his gaze in the direction she pointed and did indeed see Medusa’s bewitching figure leaning lazily on a tree trunk. Her pretty eyes were starting at the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Why are you here?” Xiao Yan asked in surprised.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think that you can bring Zi Yan away by yourself. I am worried about her following you.” Medusa faintly replied. She immediately walked over with slow footsteps and lifted Zi Yan up while ignoring Xiao Yan’s stunned eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he saw this. He could only say, “Alright, you can follow. I am going to undertake a retreat and not to have fun. The reason I am bringing Zi Yan along is also because she will require an enormous amount of energy in order for her to advance and the place that I am heading to is very suitable for her.”</p>
 <p>While he spoke in this manner with his mouth, Xiao Yan’s shoulders shook, and his jade-green fire wings slowly extended out. Finally, they transformed into beautiful fire wings that were over ten feet long.</p>
 <p>“You can bring Zi Yan along and follow me.” Xiao Yan spoke to Medusa before flapping his wings. His body rose to the sky before flying toward the distant Magical Beast Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>Medusa looked at Xiao Yan’s helpless figure from behind and a faint arc that could hardly be sensed was lifted on her cold beautiful face. She immediately pulled Zi Yan as her body flashed and appeared in the sky. Her toes pressed on the empty space and swiftly flew in the direction of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan had took a map of the Jia Ma Empire when he left. He followed the route in his memory and swiftly flew to northwestern side of the empire.</p>
 <p>Back then, that little mountain valley was located deep in the northwestern part of the Magical Beast Mountain Range. That place was extremely far from the empire. An ordinary flying beast or a horse carriage would have at least taken five or six days before they could reach the place they were headed to. However, the current Xiao Yan was no longer that small Dou Zhe from back then. With his current speed, he would need less than a day to move anywhere in the Jia Ma Empire.</p>
 <p>Using the route indicated by the map, Xiao Yan and the other two continued hurrying through their journey for half a day. They arrived at a mountain peak that was near the Magical Beast Mountain Range in the evening.</p>
 <p>Their bodies slowly landed from the sky. Xiao Yan stood on the mountain peak. His eyes carried a thread of memory as he studied the land that was somewhat familiar. He could still remember that it was in this place that he had once been chased by a mercenary company called the Wolf Head until he had fled deep into the mountain range. It was there that he had first met Yun Yun, who had been using the name Yun Zhi at the time…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan descended into his memories. Only after a long while did he softly sigh. A couple of years had past. It truly was a situation where the physical aspects were similar but the people had completely changed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze followed the mountain peak and shifted down. Finally, it paused on the little town that was seated at the foot of the mountain. He could still remember that this little town was named Qingshan Town. It was his first training spot after he had left Wu Tan City back then. Here, he had befriended the first friend of his life, the kind girl who was called Little Fairy Doctor…</p>
 <p>hat white-dressed girl, who was gently sitting in a medicinal shop healing those injured mercenaries, flashed across Xiao Yan’s head. He exhaled his breath. Nearly six to seven years had past and he did not know how she was currently doing. Did her ‘Woeful Poison Body’ that even Yao Lao was somewhat afraid of undergo an outburst? Xiao Yan felt heartache as he recalled that kind girl who had to consume poison everyday to maintain her body’s functions.</p>
 <p>Numerous emotions flashed across Xiao Yan’s heart. A moment later, they transformed into a soft sigh that was emitted from Xiao Yan’s mouth. He looked toward Medusa and Zi Yan by his side. He smiled and said, “Let’s go. First, head to the little town…” His body moved after saying this and became like a falling leaf in a breeze as it gently rushed down. Medusa and Zi Yan followed close behind.</p>
 <p>Given the speed of the few people, they appeared in the little town after a couple of breaths. They looked at the somewhat ancient words on the entrance of the small town that still existed. Xiao Yan mind was momentarily a little absent-minded as he muttered, “Qingshan town, it has been a long time since I last saw you…”</p>
 <p>A few years ago, a young man had left his clan to train. He had difficulty walking while carrying that enormous black ruler on his back. He had arrived at this place with a head covered with perspiration. That somewhat tender face revealed a smile as though he had unloaded a heavy burden when he looked at the small town.</p>
 <p>“This place is the first place I came to when I was training back then. The me then was merely a little fellow who had just advanced to the Dou Zhe class…” Xiao Yan smiled slightly and spoke to the two people beside him.</p>
 <p>Zi Yan and Medusa were startled when they heard this. They secretly laughed, “It is unexpected that after having not come here a few years that the little fellow who was a Dou Zhe back then has already become this strong. Do you have the feeling of the physical objects remaining the same but the people being different?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and patted Zi Yan’s head. He lifted his head and looked in all directions. The current size of Qingshan Town was much larger compared to what it was back then. Even the flow of people had become many times greater than what it was. There were some passersby and mercenaries who were preparing to enter the Magical Beast Mountain Range to hunt for Magical Beasts passing by this entrance of this small town. This human flow would involuntarily slow their footsteps when they passed by Xiao Yan and the other two. Of course, the main reason for them to shorten their strides was naturally not because of Xiao Yan but instead because of Medusa and Zi Yan by his side.</p>
 <p>There were hardly any females whom Xiao Yan had met that could compare with Medusa in terms of beauty. This was especially true combined with her ice-cold and noble demeanor that was faintly present. It caused people’s eyes to involuntarily shoot over. Moreover, due to her being Medusa, her entire body was emitting a kind of bewitching allure that caused one to become a moth that leaped uncontrollably into a flame despite clearly knowing that she was a beautiful female snake who knew how to eat humans.</p>
 <p>Zi Yan currently still possessed the appearance of a little girl, her jade-carving-like appearance was extremely cute. Her gem-like eyes flashed repeatedly and gave one the feeling of liking her too much to let go. This point could be clearly identified from Medusa’s attitude toward her.</p>
 <p>Of course, those numerous gazes that looked at the two woman would still be thrown toward the black-robed, young man who stood between them. Some of the mercenaries whose body were covered with muscles would curl their mouths upon seeing the other party’s skinny figure. They would quietly grumble about how this skinny, weak guy would have such luck with women.</p>
 <p>Medusa’s coldness also attracted quite a lot of attention. Perhaps it was because these people had frequently licked blood from their blades but these mercenaries’ instincts told them that this woman was somewhat frightening despite the heat that was revealed in their eyes…</p>
 <p>Their instincts were extremely accurate. This was because Medusa’s pretty eyebrows had already become slightly vertical under the focus of the many eyes. Seven colored energy was partially visible on her hand under her sleeves.</p>
 <p>“Forget it…” Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he sensed the slight energy fluctuation from beside him. The killing aura of this woman was too strong.</p>
 <p>Medusa hesitated for a moment after hearing Xiao Yan’s words. Although she did not say anything, the energy on her hands had been quietly reduced.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan walked into the small town. The road that was paved with rock fragments caused Xiao Yan’s mood to be quietly relaxed. He had not felt such a feeling in a long time. After he had left the Jia Ma Empire, he had been living by utilizing every second as he raced against time. He had trained all day and night.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan walked an entire street before turning around once again. A long while later, he slowly paused his footsteps outside an enormous medicinal shop. His gaze was absent-minded as he looked at the scene that was still somewhat familiar. Back then, he had met the Little Fairy Doctor for the first time in this shop. The medicinal shop was currently even larger than back then, but it lacked that gentle smile to brighten the place.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan let out a soft sigh. He suddenly felt a feeling of melancholy. With a wave of his hand, he turned his head and spoke to the two people beside him, “Forget it, let’s leave. We will enter the Magical Beast Mountain Range today.”</p>
 <p>Medusa and Zi Yan did not reveal any other opinions as they nodded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not procrastinate when he saw this. He turned around and walked toward the path that lead out of the small town and headed into the Magical Beast Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>However, Xiao Yan had just turned his body when chaos suddenly ensued on a path not far away. Two human figures immediately rushed into the crowd and fled in panic. When the two human figures rushed past the street, a couple of human figures came rushing down from a building beside them and blocked the both of them.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, you are thinking of fleeing? Today, not a single person of your ‘Bloody Battle Mercenary Company’ will be able to flee!” A middle-aged man,who had a scar on his face, slowly walked forward, and gave a savage smile to the man and woman who were blocked by him.</p>
 <p>The two people who were surrounded were a man and a woman. The man was a middle-aged person with a strong build. His calm face currently held a bitterness. The woman by his side was quite young. Her lovely figure was slim and her appearance was also quite beautiful. However, that lovely face was unusually white at this moment.</p>
 <p>“You should hurry and leave. I will stop them!” The middle-aged man’s gaze stared intently at that man with the scar and sternly cried out, “Han Rui, our ‘Bloody Battle Mercenary Company’ has already given up most of the territory in Qingshan to you. Why must your Snake Nest Mercenary Company exterminate us? Aren’t you too arrogant even if you have the He clan supporting you?”</p>
 <p>“What can you do if we are arrogant? The chief has said that we will not leave even a single person in the ‘Bloody Battle Mercenary Company’ alive! If you are wise, you will hand over that little girl as soon as possible. The chief has decided to take her body tonight.” The man with the scar let out a savage smile as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Dream on!” The middle-aged man cried out angrily. However, he turned around and slammed his palm onto the woman’s body. A force pushed her back by over ten meters. “Ling Er, flee! Enter the Magical Beast Mountain Range!”</p>
 <p>The man with the scar coldly watched the actions of the middle-aged man as he let out a cold laugh. He waved his hand. “Kill him!”</p>
 <p>A couple of human figures immediately gave an affirmative response when they heard the order. They immediately brandished their weapons and charged at the middle-age man. That man with the scar, on the other hand, strode toward the woman with a pale, pretty face. The corner of his mouth contained a lewd smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan watched this sudden unexpected scene from the end of the street. Originally, he was not the least bit interested in this kind of matter where people killed each other for revenge. However, the ‘Bloody Battle Mercenary Company’ that the man with the scar mentioned had brought back some of his memories. His gaze studied that middle-aged man and the woman. He knit his brows slightly. Ling Er?</p>
 <p>“Grug!”</p>
 <p>During the time that Xiao Yan was deep in thought, the middle-aged man, who was originally injured, was no match for an attack from a couple of opponents. Finally, he was forced back with a palm strike and a mouthful of blood was spat out. He turned his head and looked at the man with a scar who was walking toward the woman with a lewd smile. A tragic laughter was emitted as despair surfaced in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Ka Gang!” The woman who called Ling Er finally could not control herself as she cried out with tears when she saw the middle-aged person being wounded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, who was at the end of the street, let out a soft sigh when he heard her cry. He finally managed to remember that accidental encounter in the Magical Beast Mountain Range back then.</p>
 <p>Although there were quite a number of people observing the scene that was happening on the street, there was not a single person who dared intervene. Clearly, the people here were extremely afraid of the people backing up the man with the scar.</p>
 <p>That man with the scar also appeared to be aware of this point. Hence, he was unafraid when he acted. His arrogant ear-piercing laughter caused quite a number of people to frown.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, it is useless no matter how you shout. Miss Ling Er, obediently return with me. After our chief has enough fun with you, I will serve you properly…” The man with a scar let out an obscene laugh. His large hand grabbed at the woman. At this moment, the latter appeared to be without any strength to retaliate. Hence, she could only watch the large hand come closer. Her eyes revealed a despair and miserable color.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! You are worse than even an animal. A beast…” The middle-aged man who was called Ka Gang watched the actions of the scarred man and angrily scolded. However, his curse had just sounded when a human figure stomped his foot against Ka Gang’s chest and kicked him to the ground, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood once again.</p>
 <p>The scarred man coldly smiled as he looked at Ka Gang. His hand was suddenly extended and grabbed at the woman in front of him.</p>
 <p>However, his body strangely paused when his hand was still half a foot from the woman. A powerful force rushed over and violently smashed into his chest.</p>
 <p>“Grug! Grug! Grug… grug… grug…”</p>
 <p>The sudden heavy blow caused the scarred man’s expression to turn pale. A mouthful of fresh blood was spat to the sky and his body fell like a dead dog. It also rubbed against the street for over ten meters before slowly coming to a stop.</p>
 <p>This kind of unexpected turn of events caused the street to instantly become quiet. A countless number of people were stunned as they looked at the man with a scar who had suddenly become a dead dog. Their minds had difficulty coming to terms with the change.</p>
 <p>The lovely lady who was called Ling Er also opened her small mouth and looked at the scarred man who was repeatedly moaning on the ground. A moment later, she seemed to have sensed something as she suddenly turned her head. A black robe slowly imprinted itself in her eyes.</p>
