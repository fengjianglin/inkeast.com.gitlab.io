 <p><strong><u>Chapter 230: Success</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind dragged the wisp of green-colored flame and slowly circulated it. At the places where the flame passed through, the ice layer coagulated from the ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ continued to melt.</p>
 <p>As he carefully dragged this tiny wisp of green-colored flame and circulated it through some of his Qi Paths, other green-colored flames were also gradually attracted to this companion of theirs. With the help from the attraction force between the green-colored flames, the divided wisps of green flame in his body began to slowly merge together as Xiao Yan continued to control this one wisp of ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ as he circulated it through his Qi Paths.</p>
 <p>When the last wisp of green-colored flame was gathered together through Xiao Yan’s hard work, the green-colored flames gradually merged. A moment later, it coagulated into a tiny green-colored lava.</p>
 <p>Eyeing this green-colored lava that had once again appeared, Xiao Yan forcefully withstood the twitching pain that was emitted from within his body. He clenched his teeth and dragged it to continue circulating through his Qi Paths.</p>
 <p>The ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ after being merged together had undoubtedly become more violent and terrifying. When the green-colored lava trickled past, the thick ice layer was transformed to the point of not even having the thickness of a thumb. Moreover, the cold fog that it emitted was also incinerated by the green-colored flame until it turned into nothingness. The ice layer which had lost its replenishing system had a difficult time withstanding the erosion of the ‘Heavenly Flame’.</p>
 <p>The effect of the ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ was gradually being reduced with each movement of the heavenly flame. On one occasion when the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ erupted, a small section of the ice layer within Xiao Yan’s Qi Path was actually completely melted. A small drop of green-colored lava penetrated through the defence of the ice layer and landed on the naked Qi Path. Immediately, the Qi Path acted like a excited worm and tensed up. An intense pain that reached deep into his soul caused Xiao Yan to violently vomit a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s teeth clenched against each other. That sudden appearance of intense pain caused Xiao Yan’s head to feel giddy for awhile before he gradually calmed down. He did not even have time to wipe away the blood stains as he hurriedly focused upon the heavenly flame. Once again, he controlled the green-colored lava and slowly circulated it along the Qi Paths.</p>
 <p>During the circulation, Xiao Yan’s mind grew increasingly proficient in controlling the movements of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’. However, because of this, the temperature that the green-colored flame emitted grew increasingly frightening. By now, the ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ in Xiao Yan’s body was being repeatedly defeated by the ‘Heavenly Flame’ attack. It was likely only going to last a little longer before it completely melted with exhausted energy.</p>
 <p>Clenching his teeth intensely, Xiao Yan used all his might to drag that tiny green-colored lava. The high temperature that was released from within it, seeping through Xiao Yan’s Qi Paths and bones, directly causing tiny white-colored bubbles to appear on the surface of Xiao Yan’s body. When the white bubbles broke, it revealed the bright red flesh under it. Numerous small crack lines spread out from within the blood and flesh, finally covering all over Xiao Yan’s hands and body. They made Xiao Yan seem like a damaged porcelain doll, appearing extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>Eyeing Xiao Yan’s cracked skin all over his body, the corner of Yao Lao’s eyes twitched involuntarily. This phenomenon of the skin cracking meant that the hot air had spread all over the interior of Xiao Yan’s body. Without any path out, all the hot air could only break through Xiao Yan’s skin and create cracks to escape through.</p>
 <p>Usually, the appearance of such a scenario meant that the situation in the body was not proceeding smoothly. This was because if an energy surge were to happen, then the surface of Xiao Yan’s skin had a high possibility of being directly blown apart.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s old face swiftly changed. His hands gripped tightly into a fist and relaxed repeatedly. It took a long while before he managed to suppress the fear in his heart. He waited quietly at the side, not daring to make the slightest sound to interrupt Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>The current Xiao Yan ignored the changes on the surface of his body. Instead, he had already placed all his attention onto the green-colored lava that was about to complete one circulation of his Qi Paths.</p>
 <p>When the green-colored lava flowed through a main Qi Path, it finally completed a perfect full cycle. At this moment, Xiao Yan could clearly feel that relationship between his mind and the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ had become a little more tacit.</p>
 <p>After the green-colored lava completed the final circulation, there was a sudden surge of Dou Qi in Xiao Yan’s body. This slight change had an extreme effect on the unstable situation. The slight tremble of the Dou Qi caused the hot air that filled Xiao Yan’s entire body to violently surge outward through Xiao Yan’s arm, carrying a big piece of flesh and blood with it.</p>
 <p>The sudden intense pain caused Xiao Yan’s spirit to violently tremble a few times. On his forehead, cold sweat was like dripping water as it swiftly fell, drenching his clothes.</p>
 <p>Taking a few deep breath in his heart, Xiao Yan’s palm groped within the storage ring and took out a bottle of healing medicine. He randomly poured it over his wound and continued to place his mind on the green-colored flame in his body.</p>
 <p>Due to the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ having completed one cycle, the Purple Flame Dou Qi within the vortex of his body suddenly started writhing. Under the direction of his mind, a wisp of Purple-colored Dou Qi flowed out from the vortex and covered the green-colored lava within it… Although each time the purple flame came into contact with the ‘Heavenly Flame’. it would be instantly incinerated into nothing, it was fortunate there was a near-never ending supply of purple flame. Therefore, the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ that had just finished one cycle was once again dragged through the route required by the ‘Flame Mantra’…</p>
 <p>As the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ was pushed through the route dictated by the ‘Flame Mantra’, it appeared to have felt an uneasiness somewhere. Immediately, the flame which had become calmer after a full cycle, once again became violent. A dark green-colored flame rose from the lava and ruthlessly grilled the Qi Paths that had been covered by a layer of ice. Wherever the flame passed, the Qi Paths completely changed their shape; they looked severely injured.</p>
 <p>Having swallowed the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ in this manner, Xiao Yan could be considered to have experienced its terror. Before this swallowing had completed, the inside of his body was already damaged until it was a complete mess. Looking at his current wounds, he would have to rest for at least a few months even with the help of various healing medicinal pills if he wanted to recover back to his original condition. After all, his injuries this time around were far too serious. If he were an ordinary person, it might have been enough to turn him into a cripple…</p>
 <p>Within his Qi Paths, the Purple Flame Dou Qi continued to be incinerated into nothingness while the vortex continued to go all out to deliver the Dou Qi. It would deliver the same amount of Dou Qi that was burnt. Although by pushing it like this, the Dou Qi stored within the vortex was diminishing at a visible speed, at the same time the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ also began to circulate successfully through the route directed by the ‘Flame Mantra’ Qi Method.</p>
 <p>Within the interior of his Qi Paths, the layer of ice formed by the ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ had gradually become thin from its original thick state after being depleted by the ‘Heavenly Flame’ over a long period of time. It then transformed from its thin state to one that barely existed. By now, the freezing cold layer of ice had already completely lost its ability to protect…</p>
 <p>With the disappearance of the layer of ice, the already terrible circumstances inside Xiao Yan’s body became even worse. The high temperature grilled his Qi Paths until they were a jumbled mess. In some tiny areas, the Qi Paths began to gradually form clots, blocking the flow of Dou Qi.</p>
 <p>By this stage, Xiao Yan, who had already played all his cards, could only clench his teeth and put in all his effort to drive the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ to complete the circulation route of the ‘Flame Mantra’ Qi Method. This was because only by doing this would he receive a perfect compensation. Otherwise, once the ‘Heavenly Flame’ flared back up, he might well be turned into powder on the spot.</p>
 <p>“Chi…” On Xiao Yan’s face, a small blood slit suddenly cracked open. Fresh blood flowed out from it, wetting half of Xiao Yan’s face with a blood red color. Looking at him, he appeared like a white and red demon.</p>
 <p>The closed eyed Xiao Yan naturally did not know just how terrifying his outer appearance had become. He could only vaguely sense that there was an intense pain that suddenly appeared on his face. After which, he focused all his attention on circulating the Dou Qi, pulling that green-colored lava, whose resistance was growing increasingly intense and completing the final path of the ‘Flame Mantra’ Qi Technique.</p>
 <p>After being depleted by the ‘Heavenly Flame’ for a long time, the Purple Flame Dou Qi in the vortex appeared to be almost completely exhausted. There were only the base seventeen drops of purple-colored liquid energy that were rolling around the vortex.</p>
 <p>TL: Purple drops cannot be recovered (unless to train to that stage again) unlike regular Dou Qi that can be recovered over time</p>
 <p>When the last thread of gas Dou Qi was released, Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before he began to transfer the liquid energy out of the vortex and directed them to cover the green-colored lava and use all their might to drag it.</p>
 <p>The liquid energy within the vortex was worthy of being of a higher grade compared to the gas energy. A small droplet of purple-colored liquid was able to withstand the incineration of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ for over twenty seconds before it completely evaporated.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the effect of the liquid energy was quite good, Xiao Yan’s spirit rose. He did not care about anything else as he directly and continuously withdrew drops of liquid energy from within the vortex and then drove the green-colored lava strip to pass through the last stretch of the route signalled by his Qi Method.</p>
 <p>The seventeen drops of purple-colored liquid energy in the vortex were consumed until only three drops were left. By then, the green-colored lava finally exited the last route of the ‘Flame Mantra’ Qi Method… when the green-colored lava exited the last Qi Path, a sudden faint cooling feeling suddenly rose within Xiao Yan’s head which had been numbed from the intense pain, causing him to recover quite a lot of calmness.</p>
 <p>After the current ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ passed through the route of the ‘Flame Mantra’ Qi Method, the high temperature that carried an extremely damaging strength suddenly began to gradually weaken. A moment later. the high temperature almost completely withdrew into the lava. The violence disappeared and a thread of soothing warmth gradually spread forth…</p>
 <p>“Have I succeeded…”</p>
 <p>Within the mountain cave, Yao Lao eyed Xiao Yan whose entire body did not even have a piece of skin that was in good condition and sighed heavily. A gratified smile appeared on his face as he nodded slightly. His finger flicked gently and the tiny Acceptance Spirit on the rock’s surface turned into a gray glow that shot directly into Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>As the Acceptance Soul entered Xiao Yan’s body, a piercing green-colored flame cover instantly shot out from within Xiao Yan’s body. After which, it quickly wrapped around him. The writhing hot green flame on it isolated everyone’s sight from Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Eyeing the green-colored flame cover that suddenly appeared, Yao Lao smiled slightly and muttered softly, “What a frightening little guy. He was actually able to withstand the pain caused by the ‘Heavenly Flame’ forging through his body. How remarkable…”</p>
 <p>Within the spacious interior of the mountain cave, the green-colored flame cover wrapped Xiao Yan within it much like a chicken egg. The writhing green-colored flame seemed to declare that Xiao Yan was undergoing a metamorphosis…</p>
