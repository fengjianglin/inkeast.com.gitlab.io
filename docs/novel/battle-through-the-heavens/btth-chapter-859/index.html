 <p><strong><u>Chapter 859: It Is Really You</u></strong></p>
 <p>The sudden laugh instantly caused everyone’s expressions to change. Their gazes immediately turned in the direction where the laughter originated. They could see three human figures had suddenly appeared on a tall tree outside of the col. The person at the front, who was wearing a black robe, was Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Old Ying Shan and Mo Tian Xing were slightly startled when their eyes saw Xiao Yan’s group. Their expressions immediately revealed quite a great change. A moment later, Mo Tian Xing finally laughed and said, “It’s actually mister Yan Xiao. It is unexpected that even you have seen through this old demon Ying’s trick.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan vaguely smiled. His gaze gained a deeper meaning as it looked at Mo Tian Xing. He laughed and said, “It is unexpected that sect leader Mo is also here. This really surprises me.”</p>
 <p>Mo Tian Xing’s expression became somewhat unnatural when he heard Xiao Yan’s words that seemed to indicate something. They were the people who held the auction. Yet, they ended up quietly attacking the customers who had bought the item. If this news were to spread, it would not be considered a good thing for the Black Emperor Sect. Although the most important thing within the ‘Black-Corner Region’ was one’s strength and a sufficiently large fist, one still needed a little integrity. Otherwise, who would dare to participate in any auction that the Black Emperor Sect decided to hold in the future?</p>
 <p>People would be worried that the thing they had bid for at a high price would end up being snatched by someone else after they had paid for it. As a result, not only would they fail to obtain their bids, but they might even lose their lives. Hence, Xiao Yan’s current appearance caused a cold killing intent to appear in Mo Tian Xing’s heart. If it was not due to Mo Tian Xing being afraid of the Little Fairy Doctor beside Xiao Yan, it was likely that he would have long since launched an attack.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, this sect leader Mo is unwilling to part with the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. Hence, he quietly did something to it. After which, he planned to quietly snatch it back. What a good tactic.” Old Ying Shan’s gaze swept over Xiao Yan’s group. It paused on the white-clothed Little Fairy Doctor. He then laughed in a strange manner.</p>
 <p>“Old demon Ying, attempting to gain the upper hand in an argument now does not benefit you.” A denseness surfaced on Mo Tian Xing’s face as he slowly spoke.</p>
 <p>“Sect leader Mo’s tone is really arrogant. You can come and give it a try. Even though the current condition of this old me is no match for you, you would have to pay the price of being seriously injured if you wish to defeat me. At that time…” Old Ying Shan coldly laughed as his gaze swept over Xiao Yan’s group. The meaning in his words was understood even without being said.</p>
 <p>Mo Tian Xing slowly clenched his fist under his sleeves. His expression also became slightly gloomy. The current situation was indeed not quite easy to resolve. It was fine if no one discovered this place. He could go all out and risk getting seriously injured to kill Old Ying Shan. However, Xiao Yan’s group, consisting of three significantly strong individuals had arrived. He clearly understood in his heart that Xiao Yan’s group had come because of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. If he were to be seriously injured in the battle with Old Ying Shan, Xiao Yan would have gained an advantage from the situation. Mo Tian Xing would naturally not do something to help another.</p>
 <p>The cold smile on the corner of Old Ying Shan’s mouth grew denser after seeing the solemn look that flashed past Mo Tian Xing’s face and his hesitation. The appearance of Xiao Yan’s group had instantly turned this situation into an extremely chaotic one. At this moment, it was likely that no one would dare to recklessly do anything. Such a situation undoubtedly benefited him greatly. As long as he was given sufficient time, he would be able to retrieve that spiritual avatar. At that time, he would once again be able to recover to his peak condition. By relying on this tactic it would not be difficult to flee.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere within the col solidified in this manner. Even Xiao Yan’s group did not dare to carelessly attack. After all, Mo Tian Xing and Old Ying Shan were both not ordinary people. It would be quite difficult for the three of them to deal with two elite Dou Zongs.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, mister Yan Xiao, this ancestor has an idea…” Mo Tian Xing suddenly smiled and spoke to Xiao Yan amid this stiff atmosphere.</p>
 <p>“Sect leader Mo, please speak.” Xiao Yan’s face also carried a friendly smile. However, his heart was quite afraid and cautious of this old fellow who was like a smiling tiger.</p>
 <p>“I assume that mister Yan Xiao has come here targeting the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, no?” Mo Tian Xing asked an unnecessary question. He immediately smiled and said, “Why don’t we do this? The both of us can join hands to deal with Old Ying Shan. If we obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from his hands, my Black Emperor Sect will not take it. However, mister Yan Xiao must give us some compensation. What do you say?”</p>
 <p>“Compensation?” Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He half-smiled and asked, “Zong Breaking Pill?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, it is really easy to speak to an intelligent person.” Mo Tian Xing smiled and asked, “What does mister Yan Xiao think?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. He exchanged gazes with the Little Fairy Doctor by the side, appearing as though he was a little interested.</p>
 <p>“Don’t trust this old fellow. You have wreaked his plan and he will definitely not let you off easily. Moreover, with his greed, do you think that he would be willing to hand the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva over to you?” Old Ying Shan coldly laughed while Xiao Yan was in deep thought.</p>
 <p>“You’re noisy!” Mo Tian Xing’s face suddenly sank. He waved his sleeve and a ten-foot-large golden-colored Dou Qi shot out explosively. Immediately, it was like a golden python that hissed through the air headed toward Old Ying Shan.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Old Ying Shan also let out a cold snort when he saw Mo Tian Xing attack. His shriveled hand was extended out before suddenly clenching. The space in front of him became distorted and that golden-colored Dou Qi heavily struck that distorted substance-like space. It exploded into an earth-shaking sound, and both were annihilated. However, at the same time that they were annihilated, the remaining energy ripple caused this small col to violently tremble a couple of times. A couple of enormous rocks rolled down from the mountain peak while carrying a loud crashing sound.</p>
 <p>“Mister Yan Xiao, please rest reassured. The old me guarantee you that as long as you are able to hand the Zong Breaking Pill to my Black Emperor Sect, we will definitely not touch that Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva!” Mo Tian Xing once again turned his gaze to Xiao Yan after he had attacked in anger. His voice was extremely sincere as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan appeared to be in deep thought over Mo Tian Xing’s suggestion on the surface. However, his heart was filled with cold laughter. From the way he looked at it, this Old Ying Shan and Mo Tian Xing were all crafty old foxes. None of them could be trusted. Promises and guarantees were little different from farting to them. They did not have any binding effects.</p>
 <p>Although Mo Tian Xing did not have any trustworthiness, his suggestion was not one that was infeasible. Old Ying Shan was similarly not an ordinary person. Everything would be much easier and simpler if they finished him off now. Who would end up owning the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was a matter to be decided later…</p>
 <p>However, just as Xiao Yan was planning to agree a faint voice suddenly resounded from nowhere.</p>
 <p>“Sect leader Mo, if you really want to seek someone to cooperate with, why do you need to look for them? Isn’t my Demon Flame Valley a better choice?”</p>
 <p>The expressions of everyone present changed when they heard this voice. Their gazes immediately moved in an abrupt manner and saw over ten rays of light rushing over from the northern sky. Within a couple of blinks, they had appeared in the sky above this col. The person leading them was surprisingly that mysterious gray-robed person. Behind him, First Elder Fang Yan and the Elders from the Demon Flame Valley were looking at the area with a cold smile in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“The people from Demon Flame Valley…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s brows were tightly knit as he glanced at this group of people. He muttered, “These fellows… how did they discover this place? Things are going to be somewhat troublesome now…”</p>
 <p>Old Ying Shan’s expression had also become somewhat ugly because of the appearance of the Demon Flame Valley. At this moment, the situation was worsening for him with the appearance of a greater number of experts. Being in possession of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, he was the target of everyone. Although he might be an elite Dou Zong, there were at least three people present who were of the same class as him. It was still fine if it was one on one. However, if it became one versus three, he would not even know how he died…</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, it is unexpected that even the Demon Flame Valley have seen past the tricks of old demon Ying…” Mo Tian Xing’s expression had sunk initially, but he quickly smiled and spoke. His gaze slowly paused on the gray-robed person leading the Demon Flame Valley’s group. He smiled and said, “May I know just who this expert is? Base on what the old me knows, the valley chief of the Demon Flame Valley appears to be in a deep retreat. I don’t think that you are him, right?”</p>
 <p>“Mister is a VIP of our Demon Flame Valley. Sect leader Mo has not come and visited our Demon Flame Valley for a long time. You would naturally be unaware of it.” Fang Yan laughed. His somewhat dense gaze turned to Xiao Yan. He smiled and said, “This mister Yan Xiao, oh, that’s not right. It seems that I should address you as chief Xiao, right?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xiao Yan was no longer wearing the Doupeng. Therefore, his appearance had also been revealed. It was due to this that First Elder Fang Yan became aware of his identity with one glance. After all, quite a number of people in the upper echelons of the Demon Flame Valley possessed a drawing of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Chief Xiao?” Mo Tian Xing and the people from the Black Emperor Sect were all stunned when they heard this.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, don’t tell me that sect leader Mo doesn’t know that this mister Yan Xiao is actually the chief of that ‘Xiao Gate’, Xiao Yan? Back then, he was an unmatched under the limelight within the ‘Black-Corner Region’ for a short while. Even the Gold Silver Elders were defeated by him.” Fang Yan laughed.</p>
 <p>The expression of Mo Tian Xing and the others became somewhat interested after they heard Fang Yan speak. They had also paid quite a great attention to this new faction from the Black-Corner Region. Moreover, they were also very interested in this mysterious chief who had established it. It was unexpected that this mysterious chief was actually this extremely young Yan Xiao in front of them.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ignored their unusual gazes. His eyes had remained firmly locked on that gray-robed person since the latter appeared. Now that they were this close, the familiar and dark feeling that the other party gave him was very dense…</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, why? Does chief Xiao feels an extremely familiar feeling?” A dense laugh that was filled with killing intent was transmitted from under the gray robe in front of Xiao Yan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart leaped suddenly when he heard this somewhat familiar laughter. A thought flashed through his heart in a lightning-like manner.</p>
 <p>The hands of the gray-robed person gently grabbed the gray robe. He slowly pulled it apart after the laughter sounded.</p>
 <p>A face that was filled with a savage look suddenly appeared when the gray robes parted.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s dark-black eyes abruptly shrank when the gray robe parted.</p>
 <p>“It really is… you…”</p>
