 <p><strong><u>Chapter 662: Finding Solutions</u></strong></p>
 <p>Yao Lao also smiled as he saw Xiao Yan’s stunned expression. He also knew just how shocking these three ingredients were to Xiao Yan, and was thus not very surprised. He merely comforted, “It is extremely difficult to get ahold of these things. Hence, I have said not to rush. I am already very gratified that you have this thought. In any case, we still have lots of time left. We can slowly find them.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression gradually recovered. He rested for a moment before laughing bitterly. He felt a giddiness in his head. The blood essence of a rank 7 Magical Beast. This was equivalent to an extremely powerful Dou Zong. Moreover, the essence blood was something that a Magical Beast relied on to survive and grow. It was just like the fresh blood and bones within a human body. Once this thing was drawn out from the body of a Magical Beast, it would naturally immediately lose its life. Hence, if one was to summarize in this manner, one must kill an extremely powerful Magical Beast that could contend against an elite Dou Zong if one wanted to obtain the blood essence of a rank 7 Magical Beast… but Xiao Yan had not even met a Magical Beast of such a rank even once since he was born, much less discussed killing it.</p>
 <p>The skeleton of an elite Dou Zong… this ingredient also caused Xiao Yan to be similarly speechless. An elite Dou Zong could roam unhindered over the land. Most of those who could muddle on until this extent possessed quite a strong faction. Once they were killed, it would either be the case of them leaving nothing behind or that their corpse would be severely hidden and protected. If anyone dared to touch the skeleton of their ancestors, it was likely that they would bring everyone to come after you with all their might even if there was a big gap between their strength and yours. Hence, this thing was an extremely troublesome ingredient.</p>
 <p>The so-called ‘Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill’ was naturally also not some simple thing. A medicinal pill at the peak of the seventh tier was likely something that Yao Lao could not guarantee he would succeed even if he used all of his strength. There was no need to even mention the various strange and rare medicinal ingredients needed to refine the ‘Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill’. It was going to be unavoidably enormous trouble to gather all these things.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face carried a bitterness as he nodded.. He sighed, “I will remember all these in my heart. If I get the opportunity, I will definitely think of methods to gather all of these ingredients in the future.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao smiled slightly and said, “It would naturally not be this troublesome if one were to refine an ordinary body to accommodate a spirit. However, the stronger one’s Spiritual Strength, the more stringent the requirements of the body. Currently, my Spiritual Strength is quite strong. Hence, if I don’t use a stronger body, it is likely that my spirit would inflate the new body until it explodes after just entering it.”</p>
 <p>“However, I think that if you managed to gather all these medicinal ingredients and successfully refine a body that could accommodate a spirit in the future, it is likely that my strength would be stronger than when I was at my peak once my spirit merges with the new body. After all, my current Spiritual Strength is much stronger than back then.” Yao Lao laughed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan only felt a slight joy after hearing this. One could tell from listening to the manner in which Su Qian and the others addressed Yao Lao, that Yao Lao back then should have been a true elite Dou Zun. If one were a little stronger than this level, would that not mean that one would be an elite Dou Sheng that existed only in legends?</p>
 <p>Yao Lao seemed to have guessed some of Xiao Yan’s thoughts when he saw that joyous face of his. He immediately shook his head and said, “You can stop daydreaming. Do you think that it is really so easy to ascend to an elite Dou Sheng? If I really possessed that kind of strength, they would also treat me seriously if I went to your little girlfriend’s clan to help you propose marriage.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled. His heart immediately shook a little. From these words of Yao Lao, he could vaguely sense the frightening strength the mysterious clan that Xun Er belonged to. They would only treat him seriously if Yao Lao reach the Dou Sheng class. In other words, it was actually difficult for them to view him seriously by just relying on his Dou Zun’s strength?</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knit his brows intently, and sighed in his heart. Just what clan did that Xun Er belong to? It was actually strong enough to cause an elite Dou Zun, who was enough to dominate the continent, to be this afraid.</p>
 <p>“Looks like I still have an extremely long journey to travel…”</p>
 <p>“Alright, little fellow, there is no need to think so much. With your talent, I believe that you will sooner or later possess the ability to truly be comparable to that little girlfriend of yours. Ha ha, a twenty year old elite Dou Wang. One might not dare to say that such an achievement is yours alone in the continent, but it is sufficient to look down on a countless number of people.” Yao Lao smiled and comforted Xiao Yan when he saw the rapidly changing face of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He raised his head and stared at Yao Lao. His mouth moved. That manner of his where he spoke intermittently was as though he wanted to say something.</p>
 <p>“I know that you are very interested in that clan of your little girlfriend. However, there are some things that aren’t beneficial to you if you are told now. I can only tell you that the clan of theirs is one that has existed since the ancient times. They possess an extremely frightening strength, and a special talent that an ordinary person has difficulty matching… little fellow, the Dou Qi continent is very large. The things that you have come into contact with now are but the corner of an iceberg. In the future, you will gradually realize that this nearly endless continent is even more interesting that you can imagine.” Yao Lao seemed to have clearly understood what Xiao Yan wanted to ask. However, he waved his hand and simply replied with a smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly inhaled a deep breath of somewhat icy air. He nodded slightly once he suppressed the restlessness within his heart. His face also recovered the calmness of the past.</p>
 <p>“You should calmly recuperate now. You have turned yourself into such an exhausted state when you woke me up this time. If you had continued without due care for the consequences, you might have hurt your strength slightly.” Yao Lao patted Xiao Yan’s shoulders and spoke with a smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. He mused for a moment before he suddenly took out a scroll and a strange-shaped jade bottle from his storage ring. There was a medicinal pill that appeared to be agglomerated from fresh blood quietly lying within the jade bottle.</p>
 <p>“Huh? This medicinal bottle actually holds traces of an energy seal? This medicinal pill…” Yao Lao’s gaze stared intently at the jade bottle the moment it appeared. This was especially when his gaze swept past the scarlet medicinal pill within it. A solemness gradually surged onto his old face as he suppressed his voice and quietly asked.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, this medicinal pill is something that you have mentioned to me by chance back then… ‘Life Devouring Pill’.” Xiao Yan’s expression also became quite solemn. His voice was also suppressed until it was very soft. Only the two of them could hear it.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed this thing…” Yao Lao’s eyes shrank. He slowly inhaled a breath of cold air. He had already faintly guessed something from the appearance of the blood-colored medicinal pill along with the medicinal bottle that contained the traces of an energy seal.</p>
 <p>“How did you manage to get ahold of this thing? According to what I know, this medicinal pill had mysteriously disappeared with its creator on the continent back then.” Yao Lao knit his brows. His gaze suddenly turned to the scroll by the side as he said, “Don’t tell me that this is the… medicinal formula?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. This is the medicinal formula of the ‘Life Devouring Pill’.” Xiao Yan nodded his head and said helplessly, “This thing is something that my second brother had obtained deep in the mountains. It is also because of this that I want to ask teachers for help.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me that your second brother has consumed this medicinal pill?” Yao Lao smiled bitterly, and could not help but rub his somewhat painful head when he saw the increased helplessness on Xiao Yan’s face. He sighed, “This ‘Life Devouring Pill’ might be able to allow a person to become an elite Dou Wang within an extremely short period of time, but it is obtained by exchanging all of the remainder of one’s life. The lifespan of a person who has consumed this medicinal pill would be at most three years.”</p>
 <p>“My second brother only has one year of life remaining.” Xiao Yan’s expression sank as he spoke softly, “Back then second brother thought I had died when I stuck underground. The clan’s revenge had yet to be taken. In his despair, he could only risk his life and swallow the ‘Life Devouring Pill’.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao smiled bitterly. Why did all the offspring of the Xiao clan possess such unyielding characters?</p>
 <p>“Teacher, don’t tell me that there is really no means to undo the effect of this ‘Life Devouring Pill’?” Xiao Yan’s gaze looked at Yao Lao as he asked in a somewhat urgent and expectant manner.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao descended into a silence as he studied Xiao Yan’s earnest gaze. This ‘Life Devouring Pill’ was the masterpiece of that alchemist grandmaster back then. The birth of the medicinal pill had caused quite a great commotion. It would be quite difficult to undo its effect.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s mused for a moment before finally opening his mouth in the face of Xiao Yan’s gradually disappointed eyes. “Everything gives birth to opposites. If there is a poison, there must be an antidote… although I don’t have absolute confidence about whether it is really possible to undo the effect of this ‘Life Devouring Pill’, we can give it a try.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he heard that Yao Lao did not reject all hope. He handed the scroll and medicinal bottle to Yao Lao and sighed, “Since that is the case, I will trouble teacher to help study this thing. It would naturally be best if there is a way to undo it. If not… let’s leave fate to the heavens.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao nodded. He received the two things and weighed them in his hand before voicing his thoughts, “You must remember not to mention the ‘Life Devouring Pill’ to anyone. You should also remind your second brother. Otherwise, it will bring about some trouble.”</p>
 <p>“I have already informed second brother of this.” Xiao Yan smiled. He was not some novice who was unaware of everything. His experience and sophistication from training in the outside world far exceeded those of his age.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao was also reassured of Xiao Yan’s cautiousness and did not inquire more about it. He smiled and said, “You have already accounted for everything, it is time for you to rest and recuperate. Recover your strength first. This is the most important thing.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also smiled and nodded after hearing this. He sat cross-legged and slowly shut his eyes. A moment later, his breathing gradually became low and deep. He inhaled and exhaled, forming a perfect cycle. The surrounding air also fluctuated slightly as his breathing cycle was formed. Immediately, an unceasing flow of energy surged out before it was completely absorbed into the former’s body, filling up his exhausted body...</p>
 <p>Yao Lao shook his head helplessly as he watched Xiao Yan enter his training mode. He eyed the scroll in his hand, smiled bitterly and softly spoke, “This fellow was actually even able to get his hands on the medicinal formula for the ‘Life Devouring Pill’. However, it is easier said than done to obtain a method to undo it…”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao rubbed his somewhat painful head. His face was completely dispirited. Being his teacher was not relaxing…</p>
