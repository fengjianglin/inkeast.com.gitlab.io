 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1501: Shattered Space</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Bam!”</p>
 <p>Yao Tian’s body stiffened as he stood in the sky. His eyes were filled with disbelief. At this moment, there was an extremely glaring blood-red handprint on his face. Traces of blood slowly flowed out of the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>The entire sky became completely silent at this moment. Many pairs of eyes had watched what had just occurred with great shock. Their eyes shifted toward Xiao Yan in the distance, whose lips had lifted into a smile. A chill surged within their hearts. The ancient clans were most concerned about their pride, yet Xiao Yan had ruthlessly slapped Yao Tian in front of so many people. This humiliation was a greater insult than just simply killing him.</p>
 <p>“You… you dare strike me!”</p>
 <p>The silence continued for a moment before Yao Tian finally recovered from his shock. His eyes quickly turned bright-red. He glared at the spiritual avatar in front of him with crazy and savage eyed. An earth-like brown flame suddenly surged out of his body. After which, it formed a huge turtle-like object amid an earth-shaking roar. This giant turtle was covered in sharp fire thorns. Its ferocious mouth was also covered with sharp blade-like teeth.</p>
 <p>“Turtle Spiritual Earth Flame, ranked thirteenth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. It is unexpected that such a Heavenly Flame is actually in your hands…”</p>
 <p>The face of Xiao Yan’s spiritual avatar revealed a surprised expression as he watched the enormous fire turtle form above Yao Tian’s head. This Yao clan did indeed possess some Heavenly Flames.</p>
 <p>“Go and die!”</p>
 <p>Yao Tian’s face became more ferocious after the fire spirit was formed. A furious roar sounded. That enormous fire spirit moved its limbs. That giant tail, which was covered with fire thorns, unceremoniously swung toward Xiao Yan’s head. That sound of rushing wind immediately started to whistle.</p>
 <p>“A small trick.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s spiritual avatar coldly laughed upon seeing attack. His body swayed and a ten-thousand-foot-large fire dragon formed in the sky. The dragon tail was randomly swung and struck the fire spirit, causing the flame on the turtle’s body to dim. The turtle immediately emitted a cry and flew back before smashing into Yao Tian’s body.</p>
 <p>“Grug!”</p>
 <p>Yao Tian’s face paled after the fire spirit was defeated. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. The Turtle Spiritual Earth Flame was merely ranked thirteenth. On the other hand, Xiao Yan’s Heavenly Flame could fight against a Heavenly Flame ranked in the top six after having merged five types of Heavenly Flames. Additionally, Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Strength far surpassed Yao Tian. It was an extremely easy matter to defeat the other party.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>The fight between Xiao Yan and Yao Tian merely lasted for a split second. By the time Yao Wangui recovered, he could only watch as Yao Tian suffered a serious injury. His expression quickly changed as he let out a furious roar. With a ‘swoosh’ sound, his body appeared in front of that spiritual avatar. His large hand was violently extended and the space in front of him collapsed.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not intend to clash head-on with Yao Wangui. His spiritual body burst apart. It separated into waves of Spiritual Strength that eventually returned to Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, you are seeking death!”</p>
 <p>Yao Wangui suddenly lifted his head after his strike missed. His eyes were dense as he glared at Xiao Yan in the distance. Murderous intent surged within his heart. His body moved, and he appeared in front of Xiao Yan. A punch was thrown at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, old ghost, you are really full of nonsense. Do you really think that you are the biggest here?”</p>
 <p>Zi Yan, who was beside Xiao Yan, looked a little down after seeing Yao Wangui attack again. She took a step forward and blocked Xiao Yan. Her hand was clenched as it was swung forward. A large bright golden dragon roared and rose from her palm. It heavily collided with Yao Wangui.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The clash between two elite four star Dou Shengs was extremely terrifying. The space where the two fists collided collapsed. Everything within a thousand-foot-radius turned dark-black.</p>
 <p>A powerful ripple swept apart as Yao Wangui’s body flew back. His feet staggered over a dozen steps back in the sky before he managed to stabilize his body. His eyes stared at Zi Yan as he spoke with a gloomy expression, “Ancient Void Dragon?”</p>
 <p>Zi Yan took two to three steps back before stabilizing herself. In terms of a head-on clash, she had never been afraid of anyone who was the same level as her. The body of an Ancient Void Dragon was incomparably strong along with her powerful Dragon Phoenix constitution. Although her level was the same as Yao Wangui, it was not completely impossible for Zi Yan to finish him off.</p>
 <p>“An old fellow who is going overboard.”</p>
 <p>Zi Yan randomly patted her hands and coldly laughed.</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>Yao Wangui became furious upon hearing her statement. His face turned green in the process. He was about to furiously yell when Yao Ling, who had been quiet, suddenly pulled him back and shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Elder Wangui, this is merely a temperamental clash between young people. Given your status, you have lowered yourself by intervening…” Xun Er also slightly smiled at this moment as she suddenly said. “I think that everyone should take a step back. Your aim is likely not to come here specifically to fight with another. Why do you wish to waste your energy for no reason?”</p>
 <p>“Why? Does the Gu clan also intend to help this person?” Yao Wangui coldly demanded. His face twitched after hearing Xun Er speak up for Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Yao Wangui, my clan’s young miss is only stating facts. You should not try to be overly annoying…” The blue-robed old man behind Xun Er frowned and spoke in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Yao Wangui could only swing his sleeves in anger after noticing who had spoken. He was naturally acquainted with Gu Nanhai, who was stronger than him. If they choose to help Xiao Yan with Zi Yan, their three man-team would likely suffer a great loss. Hence, he could only angrily let out a cold snort. He shifted his eyes to Xiao Yan and Yao Lao before laughing in a cold voice, “The both of you should not be happy. Although my Yao clan does things with a low profile, you will not end up in a good state if you attempt to jump over our heads!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled but remained noncommittal.</p>
 <p>“Yao Wangui, it is a tragedy that someone like you is an authority within the Yao clan. I will naturally visit the Yao clan in the future. I do not feel any attachment to the Yao clan, but I will carve the names of my parents into the clan tablet!” Yao Lao’s eyes glared at Yao Wangui as he slowly stated.</p>
 <p>“The clan’s tablet will not leave any have any mediocre names. Forget about your parents. Even you do not have the qualification to carve your name on it. You should give up on this intention as soon as possible!” Yao Wangui merely mocked Yao Lao after hearing those words.</p>
 <p>“Old bastard, do you really think that I cannot finish you off today?” Xiao Yan’s expression was dark and gloomy. His voice contained a killing intent which chilled one’s heart. He viewed Yao Lao like a father. One of the things he could not accept in his heart was other people humiliating Yao Lao, yet this Yao Wangui’s mouth was filled with dirty words for Yao Lao.</p>
 <p>The eyes of Zi Yan by the side flickered after having sensed the killing desire in Xiao Yan’s heart. Both of her eyes stared at Yao Wangui. If Yao Wangui dared to utter any inappropriate word, she would immediately attack.</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>Yao Wangui’s face turned green after hearing Xiao Yan call him an old bastard. He was just about to angrily curse before he backed down because of Zi Yan’s fierce eyes. Without realizing it, their three man-team had fallen into a disadvantage today. He might be able to hold Zi Yan back but with Xiao Yan’s frightening strength, it would likely not be too much of a problem for him to kill both Yao Tian and Yao Ling. The both of them were pillars of the Yao clan, he would definitely be punished after returning to the clan if anything happened to them.</p>
 <p>Yao Wangui could only swallow the curse in his mouth after having realized such a conundrum. His eyes were sinister as they swept over Xiao Yan and Yao Lao. Finally, he swung his sleeve and led both Yao Tian and Yao Ling far away.</p>
 <p>Everyone softly exhaled after watching Yao Wangui miserably withdraw. Their eyes were a little surprised as they looked at Xiao Yan’s group. They had not expected an ancient clan like the Yao clan to suffer a loss in their hands.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s body slowly relaxed the moment Yao Wangui and the other two members of the Yao clan withdrew. His expression also recovered. He gently patted Xiao Yan’s shoulder and wanted to utter something, but he merely sighed in a pleased manner in the end. Back then, he had protected Xiao Yan under his wing and prevented him from being harmed. At this moment, this position had quietly changed. His heart felt a complicated feeling as he thought about this.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, I will accompany you to the Yao clan once we subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame!” Xiao Yan looked at the sighing Yao Lao and softly promised. He was worried that Yao Lao would head to the Yao clan alone.</p>
 <p>“Aye.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao hesitated for a moment before he smiled and nodded. His smile was warm and pleased.</p>
 <p>This farce ended when Yao Wangui’s group withdrew after suffering a setback. The strength that Xiao Yan’s group had displayed caught the eyes of many experts and factions, especially Zi Yan. When the Ancient Void Dragon tribe was powerful, it was not the least bit inferior to the Gu clan, Hun clan, or any other super factions…</p>
 <p>After the end of the farce, everyone once again placed their attention on the distant broken space. The cream-white light continued to pour out unceasingly like liquid. The desert below had turned into a creamy lava. Some bubbles occasionally rolled out from it as the bubbles charged out of many extremely hot air flows.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang!”</p>
 <p>This wait once again continued for around three hours or so. That broken space had also expanded from dozens of feet into hundred of feet. It was vaguely possible to hear some strange sounds being emitted from within that space.</p>
 <p>The shattered space swelled before reaching a couple of thousand feet in size. It finally came to a gradual stop, and a cream-colored light circle vaguely formed in the shattered space…</p>
 <p>All the experts present suddenly opened their eyes the moment the light circle was formed. They could sense the temperature of this area raise by a hundred times as much in an instant!</p>
 <p>Xun Er also opened her eyes at this moment. Her pretty eyes looked at Xiao Yan as she softly said, “It is time to get moving…”</p>
 <p>Her words seemed to possess a demonic strength. They had just been emitted from her mouth when the surrounding space immediately emitted the hurried sound of rushing wind. Numerous bodies with powerful auras rushed out of the distant sky with lightning-like speed. They collided with the cream-colored light circle with a whistle.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan suddenly stood up upon seeing everyone head out. A great heat leaped within his black pupils.</p>
 <p>Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, I have finally waited until this day!</p>
