 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1340: Talk</u></strong></p>
 <p>That middle-aged man involuntarily laughed when he saw Xiao Yan’s lack of expression. He asked, “Are you very surprised?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gradually recovered from his shock when he heard this question. He secretly observed the middle-aged man in front of him and dryly laughed. He found that he did not know what to say. In front of this frightening person with overwhelming strength, it was as though any thought that lingered within his heart would be discovered by the other party.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, I am called Gu Yuan. Speaking of which, we met when you were born. However, no one knew my identity…” The middle-aged man faintly laughed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was stunned again. He had not expected that he had met this overwhelmingly powerful clan head when he had arrived in this world.</p>
 <p>“May I know what important matter has caused this Gu clan to wait for this junior here?” Xiao Yan hesitated a moment before respectfully asking.</p>
 <p>“It is naturally because of the matter between you and Xun Er.” Gu Yuan smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart became slightly stern when he heard this. He involuntarily frowned and said, “Does clan head Gu Yuan not wish for Xun Er to be together with me?”</p>
 <p>“This is not my intention. As long as Xun Er is willing, I, as her father, will not force her. Moreover, with her current divine bloodline, even I, this clan head of the Gu clan, will not be able to force her to do anything…” Gu Yuan smiled as he continued, “If it is you, you are passable despite not being as strong as the peak of the younger generation from the Gu clan…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard these words. A joy immediately surged within his eyes. Most of the members from the Gu clan in the Gu Realm were full of enmity toward him. However, this Gu Yuan in front of him was somewhat beyond his expectations.</p>
 <p>“Thank you very much clan head Gu Yuan.” Xiao Yan cupped his hands together and joyously spoke.</p>
 <p>“You should not be in such a hurry to rejoice. Although I will not stop the both of you, some Elders of the Gu clan and some even older existences still feel some grudges in regard to this relationship. After all, Xun Er has the divine bloodline that has not appeared within the Gu clan for a thousand years. They will naturally be unwilling for such a bloodline to become imperfect because of some other thing. Therefore, you will be faced with some hindrances and it will not be easy. From the perspective of my position as the clan head of the Gu clan, I am unable to provide you much help. After all, the clan head must put the clan ahead…” Gu Yuan faintly explained.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was quiet as he nodded.</p>
 <p>“Of course, other than the position of clan head, I am also Xun Er’s father. I will naturally like something as long as it is something she likes…” Gu Yuan faintly smiled and said, “I am not too dissatisfied with you. Although the bloodline in your body has been wasted, you are able to rely on your own hard work to achieve something that is not inferior to those who possess a bloodline. This is really admirable.”</p>
 <p>“Honestly speaking, if I had known of the results today, I would not have sent Xun Er to the Xiao clan back then… ugh, it is unexpected that not only did I fail to obtain that thing, I also ended up losing a daughter. This trade is really a great loss.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan could only smile awkwardly in the face of such words. He did not dare reply.</p>
 <p>“I will not intervene in the matter between the two of you. However, I need you to promise me some things…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart pounded when he heard these words. He carefully asked, “May I know what they are?”</p>
 <p>“Relax, it is not something that you will find difficult to achieve. I just hope that when you are together with Xun Er in the future, you will allow her… to maintain an untouched body before she reaches the Dou Sheng class.” Gu Yuan hesitated for a moment as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face immediately became embarrassed when he heard this. He had not imagined that the thing that Gu Yuan wanted him to promise was such a ridiculous request. Did he appear like a person who had uncontrolled sexual desires?</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, a young person will inevitably have moments when one is impulsive. Moreover, the both of you aren’t frequently together. Cough…” Gu Yuan involuntarily and dryly coughed. He said, “The main thing is that the bloodline within Xun Er’s body is unstable, and you are also not a member of the Gu clan. If you randomly perform intercourse, it would damage the bloodline within Xun Er’s body. In the event that such a thing occurs, it is likely that those old fellows from the clan will act forcefully. You should be aware of the consequences.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and nodded. Did this great person appear in front of him in order to talk to him about this somewhat ridiculous matter?</p>
 <p>“This is something that I am only reminding you of in passing. The greatest reason for me to reveal myself is because of the Tou She Ancient God’s Jade on you.” Gu Yuan paused. After which, he looked at Xiao Yan and slowly spoke.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression involuntarily changed when he heard the words Tou She Ancient God’s Jade. He was naturally aware that this Tou She Ancient God’s Jade was a precious object within the Xiao clan. The reason that the Hall of Souls had captured his father was because of this mysterious ancient jade piece. However, hardly anyone knew that the ancient jade was with him.</p>
 <p>“The Tou She Ancient God was the last Dou Di on the Dou Qi continent. After him, not a single person has managed to reach the level of a Dou Di, which exists only in the legends even now…” Gu Yuan spoke on his own without being concerned about the change in Xiao Yan’s expression. “It is rumored that when the Tou She Ancient God died, he left behind a Dou Di remains. Within it contains the secrets of breaking through the Dou Sheng class… no one has discovered the Dou Di remains even now, a big battle erupted among the eight ancient clans and some super factions of the Central Plains many years ago. In the end, they only obtained a key to the remains… the Tou She Ancient God’s Jade in your hands. This thing is ordinarly divided into three pieces, but after experiencing a string of miserable battles, it was divided into eight. Coincidentally, they were obtained by the eight ancient clans back then. The piece in your hand is one of the eight…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded. He was vaguely aware of some of these matters. However, he had always thought that the Tou She Ancient God’s Jade had only been divided into three pieces, but there was actually eight of them.</p>
 <p>“The reason why the Hall of Souls captured your father is because of the Xiao clan’s Tou She Ancient God’s Jade…” Gu Yuan frowned slightly when he mention the Hall of Souls. “The Hun clan has always been the most strange and mysterious clan among the eight ancient clans. Back then, the Gu clan and the Xiao clan had joined hands and engaged in a big battle with them. Both parties ended up with their own losses, but we failed to cause the Hun clan too much damage. After which, Xiao Xuan became the clan head of the Xiao clan. Originally, we had the opportunity to seriously damage the Hun clan. However, Xiao Xuan was eventually surrounded and killed by many experts from the Hun clan. The Xiao clan was hence brought to its knees…</p>
 <p>“Having lost the support of the Xiao clan, the Gu clan was not able to declare war against the Hun clan by itself because everyone knew that both clans would have suffered great losses if we ended up fighting, which would provide the other factions with an opportunity. Hence, things have continued until now…</p>
 <p>“From some of the actions of the Hun clan during these years, they are likely ready to cause trouble again. Hence, this Ancient God Jade will definitely be their target… if they are allowed to obtain all the Ancient God Jade, the strength of the Hun clan will definitely soar and break the equilibrium…” The expression of Gu Yuan was a little grave as he studieded Xiao Yan. He said, “You should know just how important the Tou She Ancient God Jade is, right?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. However, an image of an underground magma world suddenly flashed across his heart. That place was the magma world under the Jia Nan Academy. There was something at the end of the magma that had caused the Tou She Ancient God Jade in his hand to react.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the end of the magma world is the hidden location of the Dou Di remains?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was contemplsting the thought. He got a premonition that the thing at the end of the magma world was definitely extremely important.</p>
 <p>“What is clan head Gu Yuan’s intentions?” Xiao Yan recovered and slowly asked.</p>
 <p>Gu Yuan started at Xiao Yan. A moment later, he shook his head and helplessly said, “According to the intention of those old fellows from within the clan, they wish for you to hand the ancient jade in your hands to the Gu clan for safekeeping, but I think that you will be unwilling to hand it over.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently nodded and replied, “There is the trace of a spiritual imprint of my father within the ancient jade. I need to rely on this to ascertain whether he is alive. Therefore, I will definitely need to keep this ancient jade.”</p>
 <p>The Tou She Ancient God Jade was the most precious thing of the Xiao clan. If it really came to that time in the future, Xiao Yan would not hesitate even a little if he had to use it to exchange for Xiao Zhan. This was a chip. With it in his hands, the Hall of Souls would not kill his father. However, if he handed the ancient jade to the Gu clan, the Hun clan might really end up doing some heartless and crazy things upon knowing that it was hopeless.</p>
 <p>Gu Yuan seemed to have already expected this answer. Hence, he did not reveal a different expression. All he did was helplessly nod as he said, “I had already guessed this reply.”</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, clan head Gu Yuan.” Xiao Yan apologized.</p>
 <p>“This suggestion was not made by me to begin with. However, the other old fellows will not easily allow you to bring such an important thing in front of the Hun clan.” Gu Yuan shook his head. He waved his hand and said, “Forget it, we will discuss this in the future. The Heavenly Tomb will open in another two days. We will discuss the matter of the ancient jade after you have come out of the Heavenly Tomb…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. He was just about to reply when the rushing sound of wind suddenly appeared at the foot of the mountain. His eyes immediately followed the sound and looked over, only to see a figure swiftly rushing over. That figure was Xun Er.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, it is really the case of a girl to end up being married off when she matures. Seeing how frantic she is, she is worried that I will do something to you…” Gu Yuan helplessly smiled when he saw Xun Er swiftly rushing over. After which, he said more to Xiao Yan, “Let’s end our conversation today. Remember the thing that you have promised me. Do not cross the line. Additionally, protect the ancient jade properly…”</p>
 <p>After Gu Yuan’s final word sounded, his body slowly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily sighed in relief when he saw Gu Yuan’s figure disappear. Subsequently, he turned his head and glanced at the extremely beautiful figure rushing over. Her face was tense, and her pretty eyes were filled with worry. He involuntarily smiled.</p>
 <p>“This girl…”</p>
