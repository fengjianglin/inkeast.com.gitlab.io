 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1311: Old Mister Mang</u></strong></p>
 <p>The soul between Xiao Yan’s brows trembled the moment he caught sight of those ten dark-black thunderbolts. A wave of indescribable danger entombed his heart. Faced against this unprecedented danger, Xiao Yan did not hesitate in store away the puppets, turn around and flee out of the lightning pool.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not recognize the miserable figure being chased by the dark-black thunderbolts nor did he wish to be acquainted. That fellow was clearly not an ordinary person. However, the dark-black thunderbolts behind him were even more extraordinary. Xiao Yan understood that if he were to even touch a little of that dark-black thunderbolt, not even a piece of him would remain…</p>
 <p>“This is really the case of extreme happiness bringing about sorrow. It is unexpected that I have actually meet with such trouble within this lightning pool…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan unleashed his speed to its limits. Numerous after-images continuously appeared behind him. However, the human figure from behind seemed to have discovered him. Moreover, the thing that caused Xiao Yan to quietly cry out was that this fellow did not flee in another direction after seeing him, rather the fellow chased after him.</p>
 <p>“Dammit, I do not have the ability to help you…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily cursed when he sensed the frightening pressure that was rushing over from behind. That fellow was clearly intending on finding a helper to join hands and fight the black thunderbolt. However, it was clear that… he had overestimated Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“The friend in front…”</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan was wildly fleeing with all his might, the rushing sound of wind appeared behind him, and a ghost-like figure appeared beside him. This figure was just about to speak when he became stunned. “Five star Dou Zun? Is this right? You actually dared to come to this empty realm lightning pool with this little bit of strength? Are you sure…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan almost vomited blood when he heard this voice. He was training properly, yet this fellow had attracted a great amount of trouble. Additionally, he even slighted Xiao Yan’s strength.</p>
 <p>Silver light flickered under Xiao Yan’s feet. He rushed forward with all his strength. Taking advantage of a small opportunity, the corner of his eye caught a glance of the human figure beside him.</p>
 <p>The owner of this figure appeared quite old. His head was covered with some white hair. His robes were mostly in tatters. Clearly, they were destroyed by the thunderbolts. However, the thing that caused Xiao Yan to feel somewhat shocked was that this old fellow still gave off a liveliness even with his miserable appearance. It was as though the overwhelmingly destructive thunderbolt did not cause him much harm.</p>
 <p>“This old fellow is definitely not an ordinary person! I wonder just where this hidden expert came from?”</p>
 <p>A thought swiftly flew through Xiao Yan’s heart at this moment. Of course, even if one used one’s butt to think, one could tell that this old fellow was not an ordinary person since he dared to step into the deepest part of the lightning pool, where even Xiao Yan did not dare to venture. Moreover, he was easily able to catch up to Xiao Yan even after Xiao Yan had dashed away with all his strength. One could simply see that the speed and strength of this old fellow had far surpassed Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>However, the current Xiao Yan wasn’t able to form even the slightest interest as to where this miserable-looking expert had come from because he could sense those dark-black thunderbolts approaching.</p>
 <p>“Is this right? Those damn things behind are really too fast, no? Forget it. Little fellow, the old me shall take my leave first…”</p>
 <p>That miserable old man had naturally sensed this as well. He let out a strange cry, and the space in front of him distorted as he entered it. The next time he appeared, he was already a thousand meters away…</p>
 <p>“Old bastard!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was a little stunned when he saw this old fellow escaping as he wished. He furiously cursed to himself.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan was cursing, his speed was not reduced as a result. He clenched his teeth, and his back trembled. Bone wings extended behind him. The wings were flapped, and his speed suddenly soared. Within a couple of flashes, he appeared a great distance away. After which, he simply fled without turning his head.</p>
 <p>After unleashing his speed to its limit throughout this journey, Xiao Yan gradually escaped the dark-black lightning. However, he did not dare to slow too much. Lifting his head to take a glance, he saw that he was near the edge of the lightning pool. He increased his speed and charged out of the rumbling lightning pool.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan continued to pant after having charged out of the lightning pool. Fear lingered on his face. It was difficult to imagine just what kind of miserable ending would have befallen him if he had been struck by the dark-black lightning.</p>
 <p>“It is unexpected that the lightning pool is not as safe as I had imagined. There is definitely something frightening in the deepest part. Otherwise, that old fellow would not have jumped up and down.” After calming down, Xiao Yan’s expression gradually recovered as he muttered to himself.</p>
 <p>“Is that right? You think those things cause the old me to jump up and down? If I was not afraid that doing something might stir a riot within this lightning pool, the old me would have long since destroyed them.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s voice had just sounded when a voice strangely exploded beside his ear, causing him to start. He hurriedly lifted his head, only to see that miserable old man suspended in front of him. The old man’s eyes watched him.</p>
 <p>The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth involuntarily twitched when he saw this old man. However, due to the other party’s frightening strength, he could only swallow the curse in his mouth. He changed the topic and asked, “What are those things?”</p>
 <p>“A group of thunderbolt monsters that possess some intelligence…” The old man curled his lips and replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knit his brows when he heard this explanation. However, he did not feel overly surprise. A Heavenly Flame would gain its own intelligence if it existed for a long time. The terrain of this place was unique and lightning had gathered here for a countless number of years. Thus, it was not strange for some unusual beings to be born.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over this old man, who appeared miserable. His heart obtained a shocking result. It was unexpected to meet an ultimate expert of such a class within this empty realm. However, this person, who repeatedly said ‘is this right’ seemed to possess a terrible character and had nearly caused him to die.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, little fellow, although your strength cannot make it, you are quite fast. Originally, I thought of lending you a hand, but you unexpectedly escaped…” The old man rubbed his hands together and smiled as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“I was merely lucky.”</p>
 <p>The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth parted, but he was screaming a string of curses in his heart. Who knew whether this old fellow spoke the truth or not?</p>
 <p>“Little fellow, those living creatures deep within this lightning pool are extremely strange. They are all formed from lightning. If one can absorb them, they are really great items of nourishment. It seems that your speed is quite good. Why don’t the two of us join hands and enter the deep region for fun?” The old man laughed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan dryly laughed with him when he heard these words. He hurriedly shook his head. Enter the deep parts? What kind of a joke was this? Just one random black thunderbolt could kill him. It was fine when he was unaware of them in the past. Now that he was aware of they existed, he would no longer step into that place even if he was beaten to death. Additionally, one glance at this old fellow and Xiao Yan knew that he was not trustworthy. Cooperating with this old fellow… Xiao Yan really did not wish to attract trouble again.</p>
 <p>“Is this right? The courage of the young people these days really cannot make it…”</p>
 <p>The old man involuntarily curled his mouth when he saw Xiao Yan shake his head. He lazily said, “However, it is fate that we meet. My surname is Mang. However, it is likely that a little fellow like you will not know the name of the old me.”</p>
 <p>“Surname Mang?” Xiao Yan thought for a moment, but was not aware of such an ultimate expert. It was likely that the true experts of the Central Plains region kept a low profile.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, ignorant younger generation…”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Xiao Yan really did not recognize him, this old man with the surname Mang let out a sad sigh. However, the words that he spoke caused Xiao Yan to be speechless.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>A wind splitting sound suddenly rushed over from a great distance while Xiao Yan was speechless. At the same time, a clear voice was transmitted over, “Little brother Xiao Yan, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>“Huh? You are someone from the Ancient Void Dragon tribe?” That old man with the surname Mang was slightly startled when he saw the figure rushing over. He glanced at Xiao Yan with some surprise, feeling a little strange that an ordinary human would have a relationship with the Ancient Void Dragon tribe.</p>
 <p>“Forget it. Since this is the case, the old me shall leave. Little fellow, your performance was not bad. However, there is too much of a gap between you and the old me. You should work hard…”</p>
 <p>That old man seemed to be unwilling to meet anyone else. Hence, he waved his hand at Xiao Yan. Before Xiao Yan could speak, the old man had turned around and disappeared in a spatial fluctuation.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was helpless when he saw the old man disappearing so quickly. He could only turn his head and look at the approaching Hei Qing.</p>
 <p>“Huh, I have finally found you. Fortunately, your body possesses the dragon seal that the great Dragon Emperor placed on you. Otherwise, it would not be easy to find you…” Hei Qing sighed in relief and spoke when he saw that Xiao Yan was safe and sound.</p>
 <p>“I met with a small accident within the lightning pool. Therefore, I have come out by myself…” Xiao Yan smiled. He did not describe what happened within the lightning pool in detail. After which, he waved his hand and said, “My training is about done. We should return…”</p>
 <p>“Alright, I was about to become totally dull from staying in this place…” Hei Qing rejoiced upon hearing that Xiao Yan was finished. He hurriedly nodded as a light soared from his body, and he transformed into an enormous black dragon in the blink of an eye. Xiao Yan moved rushed onto the dragon’s head. After which, a dragon roar resounded and the light figure turned into a flash, which rushed away. Within the blink of an eye, it had disappeared at the edge of the empty realm.</p>
 <p>Soon after Xiao Yan and Hei Qing left, another fluctuation appeared in space. An elderly figure appeared. It was the old man with the surname Mang from earlier. At this moment, he was frowning as he looked in the direction where Xiao Yan had left. It was as though he was thinking of something.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan… this name appears a little familiar…”</p>
 <p>An uncertain mutter slowly reverberated across the empty space.</p>
