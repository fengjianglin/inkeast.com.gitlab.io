 <p><strong><u>Chapter 551: No. 1 Training Room</u></strong></p>
 <p>A little girl who was wearing a white dress stood at the entrance of a training room while leaning against a wall. She glanced at everyone in the resting area. Although she appeared as though she posed no threat to either human or beast, the ferocity that was faintly contained within those pupils caused those people whose gazes met hers to feel cold sweat appear on their backs.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, it is actually Senior Zi Yan.” Liu Qing’s expression had also changed a little the moment that the little girl appeared. He appeared much better compared to the others as he immediately spoke with a smile toward Zi Yan. However, that address which he used gave one a strange feeling. Just think, a man who appeared like a huge gorilla was actually speaking to a littleaw girl, who was merely the height of his waist, in such a respectful and frightened manner. It was likely that no one would think that this was an ordinary situation.</p>
 <p>Zi Yan glanced at him before taking small steps as she walked into the area. As she walked in, the human crowd who was observing from around hurriedly stepped back. They were afraid of being the innocent party who ended up suffering while watching someone else’s affair.</p>
 <p>Lin Yan stood beside Xiao Yan. His entire body immediately became uneasy when he saw that Zi Yan was actually walking toward them. He truly felt great fear for this frightening ‘Brute Force Queen’.</p>
 <p>“Hey, who bullied you? Didn’t I tell you that you should find me if you face any trouble?” Zi Yan’s footsteps stopped beside Xiao Yan. She curled her lips toward Xiao Yan and said, “Tell me. I will help you vent your anger.” As she spoke, she even used her pair of large, intelligent, dark eyes to sweep around her. Those people who were stared at by her hurriedly shook their heads while feeling the skin on their heads become numb.</p>
 <p>Yao Sheng’s face twitched a little as he stood beside Liu Qing. He quietly took a step back and hid half of his body behind Liu Qing. It was likely that no one would dare anger this little monster who frightened everyone in the entire Inner Academy. He really did not expect that Xiao Yan would actually have such a relationship with the little monster who was the most difficult to get close to.</p>
 <p>“It is merely a small conflict. I will settle it myself.” Xiao Yan smiled shook his head in front of the focus of everyone. Although he clearly knew that Zi Yan was an extremely powerful Magical Beast, he was ultimately unable to handle the thought of using her name to swagger about because of this little girl’s appearance. Moreover, it had not really reached the stage of so-called bully. Both parties had suffered a little in his exchange with Yao Sheng earlier. It could only be said that it was a draw.</p>
 <p>Liu Qing’s expression became a little more relaxed when he heard Xiao Yan’s words. If Xiao Yan were to speak Yao Sheng’s name, it was likely that Zi Yan would immediately pull the latter out for a beating given her character. At that time, it was likely that he would have no choice but to act in order to protect Yao Sheng. Although he was not afraid of Lin Xiuya in this Inner Academy, he could not help but have a heart filled with fear when faced with this little monster. Having conflict a with her was something that Liu Qing really did not want to experience.</p>
 <p>Zi Yan frowned when she heard this. She turned around and stared at Xiao Yan with large eyes. She used a voice that only the two of them could hear and said, “Hmph, don’t think that you can stop refining Danwans for me in the future by not allowing me to help.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was neither able to laugh nor cry as he shook his head. This little fellow thought that the reason Xiao Yan rejected her help was actually because he wanted to avoid the responsibility of helping her refine Danwan. She was indeed a cute little girl...</p>
 <p>“You can rest assured that I will not go back on my promise to you. All you need to do is to bring the medicinal ingredient and come find me after you have finished eating the Danwans.” Xiao Yan smiled and rubbed Zi Yan’s head. Suddenly, he felt that the surrounding gazes were a little strange. He raised his head slightly, only to see that the surrounding people were using an extremely stunned gaze to look at him… that hand of his which was rubbing Zi Yan’s head.</p>
 <p>“Send that fellow flying with a slap.” A soft muttering sound spread among the human crowd. Zi Yan’s fierce name was something that was extremely feared among these experts on the ‘Strong Ranking’. Back then, there was no shortage of strong and bold people who issued challenges toward her. However, each and every single one of them were violently sent flying like a ball under those delicate and small hands. Finally, they ended up with their bones broken and their tendons injured. Although they fully recovered from their injuries, that kind of frightening scene was enough to cause them to remember it for the rest of their lives. Hence, some people involuntarily felt gloated when they saw that the current Xiao Yan actually dared to treat Zi Yan in this manner.</p>
 <p>Of course, their anticipated event of being sent flying was something that was naturally impossible to occur to Xiao Yan. Zi Yan merely shook her head in a displeased manner and slapped Xiao Yan’s hand. Her rebuking words caused the faces of everyone around to twitch. Since when did this ‘Brute Force Queen’ become this easy to talk to?</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan rubbing hand also stopped with some embarrassment after becoming the focus of so many eyes. He immediately withdrew it in an awkward manner.</p>
 <p>Liu Qing let out a dry cough. Since Zi Yan had appeared, it was naturally impossible for him to issue any more warnings. From the looks of the actions between Xiao Yan and Zi Yan, it appeared that the relationship between the two was not bad. He did not doubt that if he were to repeat the words he spoke earlier, that ‘Brute Force Queen’ would charge over and punch him.</p>
 <p>“Alright, the matter today shall end here. Any grudges can be settled in the Grand Competition. That is the most impartial place.” Liu Qing clapped his hand as he said faintly. Once he did so, he looked at Xiao Yan again before waving his hand, bringing Yao Sheng and the others as he turned around and left this resting place.</p>
 <p>The surrounding audience also shrugged their shoulders when they saw Liu Qing leave things alone. After which, they began to slowly spread out and leave.</p>
 <p>“Hei, I’m telling you that you should have directly said it was that sissy. With this monster helping you, why would you need to be afraid of Liu Qing?” Lin Yan’s finger gently poked on Xiao Yan’s back as he spoke softly when he saw Liu Qing and the others leave.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He did not continue to be entangled in this topic. After lazily stretching his waist, he said, “All of the training rooms here can be used, right? Are there any restrictions?”</p>
 <p>“Of course there are.” Lin Yan rolled his eyes and said, “This sixth level doesn’t have the so-called differentiation between high, middle, and low. Basically, all of it is prepared for the experts on the ‘Strong Ranking’. However, whether the inside of the training room is good or bad is determined by your ranking on the ‘Strong Ranking’.”</p>
 <p>“You are currently ranked 31st on the ‘Strong Ranking’. Therefore, your designated training room is there.” Lin Yan turned around and pointed at a corner not far away. That place had a training room that was standing alone. This training room may have been much more exquisite when compared to the training room a couple of levels above, but down here, it merely appeared simple when compared to those training rooms on the other side of the resting area.</p>
 <p>“There is a number on the door of the training room. This number represent your rank on the ‘Strong Ranking’. The further in front that a training room is ranked, the better its effect. Currently, I am using the no. 9 training room. Hee hee, training at that place would have a speed that is at least twice as fast as your no. 31 training room.” Lin Yan laughed. His laughter contained a gloating tone to it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He ignored the gloating Lin Yan as he turned around and walked toward his training room.</p>
 <p>“Hey, do you want to train here?” Xiao Yan had just turned around when Zi Yan’s voice sounded.</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>“In that case, you can go to my training room. It is no. 1. Its training speed is at least two to three times faster than no. 9.” Zi Yan’s tender voice caused the smile on Lin Yan’s face to instantly stiffen. Immediately, his face was filled with envy as he eyed Xiao Yan. The no. 1 training room. This was the training room that was dedicated for this little monster’s use. The fellows in the top 20 of the ‘Strong Ranking’ had coveted it for an unknown time, but ultimately none of them dared to issue a challenge. Hence, they could only be envious. It was really expected that Zi Yan would actually lend her training room to Xiao Yan today. This kind of treatment was something that even Liu Qing, Lin Xiuya, and the others had never enjoyed.</p>
 <p>“One can lend one’s training room to another person?” Xiao Yan’s face was filled with surprise as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Lin Yan spread his hands and spoke helplessly, “The Inner Academy would not interfere with whom the training room is loaned to as long as the owner is willing.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan mused a little after hearing this before nodding with a smile. He spoke to Zi Yan, “Alright. I shall borrow your glory and enjoy the swift training speed of the no. 1 training room.” There was merely twenty days from now to the Grand Competition. Raising his own strength quickly was the most important thing for Xiao Yan at this moment. He would appear to be a little spoiled if he were to reject her again.</p>
 <p>A smile was immediately raised on Zi Yan’s face when she heard Xiao Yan’s reply. She softly said, “However, I will come and look for you to help me refine Danwan while you are training.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Xiao Yan smiled. He would naturally not reject such a small matter.</p>
 <p>“Follow me.” Zi Yan was even happier when she saw Xiao Yan agreeing in such a decisive manner. She hurriedly led the way. Behind her, Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders toward the envious face of Lin Yan before following her.</p>
 <p>After passing through the resting area, another spacious training room immediately appeared in Xiao Yan’s gaze. As he approached, he could even faintly feel the pure energy that was seeping out from these training rooms.</p>
 <p>Along the way, Xiao Yan did indeed see numbers on the doors of some of the training rooms as Lin Yan had mentioned. Starting from the number 20, the warm energy that seeped out of the training rooms grew increasingly powerful the further one moved forward. When they had walked to the rooms that were within the first ten, Xiao Yan was even able to see threads of pale-red energy drifting like filaments through the air with his naked eye. This kind of strange scene caused Xiao Yan to be unceasingly amazed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s footsteps stopped outside of a spacious training room in the deepest area. This training room was a little strange. Other training rooms would have powerful energy overflowing out. This place, however, was completely empty. Xiao Yan could not even sense the existence of even the slightest bit of energy within it as he stood outside.</p>
 <p>“There is no need to continue sensing. This no. 1 training room is unique. The energy within it is far too powerful. An ordinary material would explode because of it. Therefore, only this special material that can completely stop the energy from spilling out can be used.” Zi Yan waved her hand toward Xiao Yan. After which, she pointed at a dark-black metal door at the end of the corridor and said, “Don’t go there. People are prohibited from entering that place. Even I have to be sent to solitary confinement if an Elder was to discover me entering. Therefore, you should be a little careful.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze followed Zi Yan’s hand as he looked over. Behind the dark-black metal door was an ink-like darkness that did not disappear. He frowned slightly and was just about to turn his head when his hand abruptly trembled. At that instant, he clearly sensed the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ within his body trembling slightly…</p>
 <p>There was only one thing within this ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ that would be able to cause the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ to have such an activity. The ‘Fallen Heart Flame’!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly inhaled a breath of hot air. He looked deeply at the black metal door before immediately and forcefully turning his head around. After which, he pushed open the door of the highest grade no. 1 training room on the sixth level..</p>
