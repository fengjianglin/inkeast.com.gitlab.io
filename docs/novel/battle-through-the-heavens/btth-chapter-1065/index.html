 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1065: News about Little Fairy Doctor</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not pause for long after leaving the Burning Flame Valley. Instead, he rushed in the direction of Tianhuang City. While he was traveling, he savored the complete training method for the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change…</p>
 <p>The Skyfire Three Mysterious Change was a peak level Secret Technique of the Burning Flame Valley. However, the uniqueness of this Secret Technique also made it difficult for one to judge its class. After all, in the hands of some people, this Secret Technique was completely useless. However, in the hands of some experts, who possessed many types of powerful flames, the might that it could unleash would definitely be comparable to other Di class high level Secret Technique.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Xiao Yan belonged to the second category. Being in possession of the Green Lotus Core Flame, Falling Heart Flame, and even the Bone Chilling Flame, he was coincidentally able to unleash this Skyfire Three Mysterious Change to its peak. It was just as Tang Huo Er had said. This kind of Secret Technique seemed to have been tailor-made for Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>The simultaneous eruption of the three types of Heavenly Flame would definitely provide a terrifying increase in strength. Xiao Yan estimated that if he were to completely unleash it, it was likely that he would truly be able to fight head-on with even old demons in Fei Tian and Wu Chen class. He would no longer need to end up so miserable after having just endured for ten exchanges in their hands.</p>
 <p>“However, the energy that is created each time the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change erupts is extremely wild and violent. This is even more so when all three changes are used. There is no telling what degree this wild, violent energy will reach. Even with the strength of my current body, it is likely going to be a little difficult for me to endure…” An expression of deep thought flashed across Xiao Yan’s face. After all, the flames inside his body were not ordinary. Instead, they were Heavenly Flames, the strongest of all flames!</p>
 <p>A Skyfire Three Mysterious Change that relied on three types of Heavenly Flames as a foundation was likely something that no one, even in the Burning Flame Valley, had ever achieved. After all, even if they possessed the ability to find three types of Heavenly Flames, who would dare to place three types of Heavenly Flames within one’s body at the same time without a mysterious Qi Method like the Flame Mantra?</p>
 <p>“It looks like even if I completely master the completed version of the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, I should not use it easily. Otherwise, it will be quite harmful to my body…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly sighed. Everything was full of advantages and disadvantages. These words were indeed true. Nevertheless, he was currently in possession of another trump card. When he fought with others in the future, the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change would greatly shock everyone.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gradually pulled his mind back when he thought of this. His eyes looked into the distance. He could see the vague outline of a city located in the distance…</p>
 <p>“I wonder how Liu Qing information gathering has proceeded in relation to the Little Fairy Doctor. Her Woeful Poison Body is indeed quite troublesome. After all, the reputation of this kind of poison body isn’t very good… hopefully nothing has gone wrong…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly muttered to himself. After which, he increased his speed, transforming into a ray of light that flashed through the sky and rushed to the distant city.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure rushed into Tianhuang City through the sky before landing in the deserted western side of the city. He identified the direction of the Liu clan before walking over.</p>
 <p>It was ten minutes later when Xiao Yan arrived outside the manor of the Liu clan. Before he could say anything after appearing, the couple of guards outside of the Liu clan manor’s door hurriedly stepped forward. They inquired in an extremely respectful manner., “Are you mister Yan Xiao?”</p>
 <p>This scene caused Xiao Yan to be startled. Of course, he was unaware that there was currently an uproar in Tianhuang City because of his name. Everyone knew that the Liu clan had a young alchemist who had reached the seventh tier…</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan felt a little surprise in his heart, he still smiled and nodded. The respectful expression in the eyes of those few guards became even denser when they saw him nod. Their leader hurriedly got someone to go in and inform Liu Qing while he personally led Xiao Yan into the manor.</p>
 <p>Not long after he had entered the manor, Xiao Yan saw Liu Qing, Lin Yan, and some others hurrying over from the other end of the path.</p>
 <p>“You have finally returned… I thought that something had happened to you in the Burning Flame Valley.” Liu Qing hurriedly stepped forward. He finally sighed in relief after seeing that nothing was wrong with Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and said, “I’m fine. It is just that I spent some time helping the Burning Flame Valley refine a medicinal pill.”</p>
 <p>“It is good that you are fine. However, recently my Liu clan has become much more lively because of you…” Liu Qing spoke with a grin.</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“Currently, many factions are aware that my Liu clan has a tier 7 alchemist. Therefore, they have come with the intention of bettering relations and trying to establish a relationship with you, a young alchemist grandmaster. Tsk tsk, an alchemist is really the most popular occupation…” Liu Qing smacked his lips and spoke with an envious face.</p>
 <p>“There are indeed quite a number who have arrived. Among them include some powerful factions. All of them want to see if you will become their honorary Elder…”</p>
 <p>“There is no need for this honorary Elder, I do not intend to stay anywhere and help people refine medicinal pills for a lifetime.” Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I knew that you wouldn’t like it. Therefore, I found an excuse to reject them. If this matter is not done properly, it will cause others to bear a grudge.” Liu Qing nodded as he replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. After which, he directed the conversation to the main topic, “Do you have any news about the matter that I informed you of last time?”</p>
 <p>Liu Qing’s expression had become much more serious when he heard these words. He led Xiao Yan and the others to a stone pavilion. Only after everyone was seated did he speak in a solemn manner, “Yes, I have some news.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s attention was braced a little when he heard this.</p>
 <p>“That Xin Lan whom you have mentioned should be a member of the Ye clan in the Pill Region. Moreover, her full name should be called Ye Xin Lan.” Liu Qing said.</p>
 <p>“Ye clan?” Xiao Yan muttered. His finger gently knocked against the stone table as he said, “What is the strength of this Ye clan like?”</p>
 <p>“Quite strong. At the very least, it is far from what my Liu clan can compare with. Of course, being able to enter the Elders seat of the Pill Tower is not something that an ordinary faction could achieve.” Liu Qing said, “The Pill Region is filled with all sorts of people. Many powerful factions on the continent possess a branch at that place. However, on the whole, there are five large clans related to the Pill Tower. The Ye clan is one of them. However, the current Ye clan is already declining. It has ended up as the weakest of the five large clans. Two years ago, they even lost an Elder’s seat in the Pill Tower. If this continues, it is likely that they will remain the weakest of the five large clans and will sooner or later be replaced by other factions.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly tilted his head in acknowledgement. No wonder the Ye clan would sent Xin Lan to the Jia Nan Academy. Their situation had already reached such a stage.</p>
 <p>“What requirements must one meet to enter the Pill Tower Elder’s seats?” Xiao Yan inquired. Since he had promised to help Xin Lan, he would naturally need to pay more attention to this aspect. Breaking his promise was something he did not wish to do.</p>
 <p>“I am not too certain about this. However, the conditions should be quite harsh. After all, that is the Pill Tower. Moreover, one must possess quite a great amount of contacts within the Pill Tower in order to enter it…” Liu Qing laughed bitterly as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly nodded. This matter was not really urgent and could be slowly discussed. Immediately, he changed the topic and asked, “Do you have news related to the Little Fairy Doctor?”</p>
 <p>Liu Qing hesitated for a moment after hearing this. Finally, he replied, “Does the Little Fairy Doctor you mentioned possess the rumored Woeful Poison Body?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart tightened when he heard these words. He nodded and asked in a deep voice, “What happened?”</p>
 <p>“I have dispatch quite a number of people to inquire about the news in the Pill Region. Currently, the matter that was spreading wildly at that place is related to this Little Fairy Doctor because she is in possession of the legendary Woeful Poison Body…”</p>
 <p>“A strange constitution like the Woeful Poison Body, whose name causes one feel fear, has appeared in the Central Plains before. Without exception, they cause great disasters. Originally, everyone thought that this kind of poison constitution had already been exterminated. Unexpectedly, it has appeared again…” There was a fear between Liu Qing’s eyebrows when he mentioned the Woeful Poison Body.</p>
 <p>“Where is she now?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly asked. Perhaps it was because of the Little Fairy Doctor’s wretched background and her poison constitution, but Xiao Yan felt a special worry for her. Moreover, she had been following beside him during all these years. Regardless of what kind of danger he faced, she would not abandon him. She had already treated Xiao Yan as a good friend whom she could trust without reserve in her heart. Xiao Yan similarly understood all this. Hence, he had been thinking of ways to help her escape the pain of the Woeful Poison Body. Xiao Yan would definitely intervene now that something had happened to her!</p>
 <p>“I am also not certain about her exact location. However, there are quite a number of factions within the Pill Region who are searching for her because they are all aware of what kind of a frightening thing this Woeful Poison Body could create…” Liu Qing understood a little as he looked at Xiao Yan’s expression. Immediately, he mused for a moment before continuing, “Among these factions, the people from the Ice River Valley are the ones searching the most…”</p>
 <p>“Ice River Valley?” Xiao Yan’s expression changed when he heard this.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, based on what I know, this Ice River Valley has always been exceptionally interested in these special constitutions. They are perhaps searching for the Little Fairy Doctor because they are interested in the Woeful Poison Body.” Liu Qing solemnly explained.</p>
 <p>“Moreover, according to the information that has been acquired, the Little Fairy Doctor has exchanged blows with the Ice River Valley’s experts some time ago. Although she ended up fleeing successfully, she has also been badly injured. Otherwise, she would not have disappeared for such a long time…” Lin Yan by the side spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly nodded. His expression also gradually became gloomy. It was unexpected that such a thing had happened during this period of time they were apart…</p>
 <p>“Ice River Valley…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan tightly clenched his hands. A dark and ruthless killing intent flashed through his eyes. If anything happened to the Little Fairy Doctor, he would get this Ice River Valley to pay the price with blood!</p>
