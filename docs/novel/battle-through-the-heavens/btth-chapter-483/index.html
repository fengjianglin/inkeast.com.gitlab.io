 <p><strong><u>Chapter 483: Strange Fellow</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan suppressed the joy within his heart and squeezed out of the human flow. He slowly walked toward this somewhat special stone table. Upon seeing his action, the surrounding human flow involuntarily halted their footsteps. The gazes which they used to look at Xiao Yan appeared to contract a playfulness of watching the fun.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s footsteps stopped in front of the stone platform. His eyes shot to that Green Wood Celestial Vine. After hesitating for a moment, his hand extended toward it.</p>
 <p>“Chi…”</p>
 <p>Just as Xiao Yan’s hand was about to touch that Green Wood Celestial Vine, a sharp wind suddenly rushed through the air toward him. The strength of the wind even caused the hair on Xiao Yan’s hand to stand up in shock.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knit his eyebrows as he sensed the sharpness of the force. A thought passed through his heart and green-colored flame immediately surged out from within the Acceptance Spirit. After which, it swiftly moved passed a few Qi Paths before it suddenly broke free from his body and swiftly wrapped around his withdrawing hand.</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>The instant Xiao Yan’s hand was wrapped by the green-colored flame, a surprised exclamation suddenly sounded. That sharp wind was immediately annihilated.</p>
 <p>After successfully withdrawing his hand, Xiao Yan lifted his head to eye the gray-robed man in front of him. At this moment, the latter had already opened his eyes. His face carried shock as he eyed Xiao Yan. When Xiao Yan’s gaze swept over the other person’s eyes, he was slightly startled as he saw that the other party’s eyes were actually filled with a strange red glow that was mixed with some ferocity.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was not unfamiliar with this kind of red glow. As long as one trained for a long time within the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,’ such a condition would appear. Normally, this was called Fire Poison invading one’s body. However, there was merely a little bit of red glow within the eyes of those people whom he had seen a couple of days ago. On the other hand, the fellow in front of him… the entirety of his eyes appeared to be filled with the red glow. Clearly, the Fire Poison had invaded deep into his body… Such a serious invasion of Fire Poison in one’s body was the first one that Xiao Yan had seen until now.</p>
 <p>“If you are not buying, don’t just randomly touch.” The gray-clothed man blinked his red eyes as he coldly glanced at Xiao Yan. After which, he spoke faintly as withdrew his fingers placed together, appearing like a knife.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was a little amused by this attitude of the gray-clothed man. He shook his head helplessly within his heart. Now, he finally understood why the people around shunned this fellow. The buyer was actually nearly attacked when he took a look at the merchandise. Regardless of how high rank the items that he displayed were, it was likely that there was hardly anyone who dared to purchase them.</p>
 <p>“Who said that I am not buying?” Xiao Yan crossed his arms in front of his chest, and replied in a similarly indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>“Don’t pay me lip service. If you want to buy, you can take out the ‘Fire Energy’ to buy it. Debating here and there and wasting time.” An irritable feeling flashed across his reddened pupils. The gray-clothed man’s hand suddenly slammed on the stone table as he spoke angrily.</p>
 <p>“The invasion of the Fire Poison into his body is actually this serious... even his mind has been affected by it.” Xiao Yan was unconcerned about the angry rebuke of the gray-clothed man. His face became slightly solemn. It was really unexpected that the Fire Poison within the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ was actually this strong. It appeared that he should be even more careful when he trained in the future even though he had the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ protecting his body.</p>
 <p>“How much does this green vine cost?” Xiao Yan pointed at the strange Green Wood Celestial Vine and asked faintly. From how the other party had placed it in the most eye-catching spot, one could understand that this fellow actually knew the rarity of this thing. Hence, there was likely going to be some difficulty if Xiao Yan wanted to carelessly obtain it like in the past.</p>
 <p>“Four hundred days of ‘Fire Energy.’” The gray-clothed man replied in a cold voice.</p>
 <p>The moment the gray-clothed man said these words, the entire area suddenly became quiet. The gaze which each of them used to look at one another was like that in which they used to look at a lunatic. Four hundred days… this kind of large number was something that some people were likely unable to obtain in an entire year or even two years. Was this fellow’s big appetite not a little overboard? Although they could also see that this green vine was a little unique, there would definitely not be some who believed that it was worth four hundred days of ‘Fire Energy.’</p>
 <p>Under this kind of sky-high price, forget about the surrounding observers, even Xiao Yan also involuntarily twitched his mouth. Four hubdred days… this fellow...</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that it is a little expensive, no?” Xiao Yan swallowed the breath that was choked in his chest before speaking with a frown.</p>
 <p>“Although I do not know what exactly this Green Wood Celestial Vine is, two Dou Wang class Magical Beasts fought to death over it. That is sufficient to prove its worth. Moreover, in order to obtain it, I nearly threw away my life. Therefore, four hundred days of ‘Fire Energy’ is not expensive. If you are really unable to afford it, please leave. Don’t disturb me doing business.” The gray-clothed man glanced at Xiao Yan and replied before waving his hand.</p>
 <p>Although the gray-clothed man spoke easily, these words of his still caused the crowd around him to be somewhat shaken. Snatching something from the hands of two Dou Wang class Magical Beast. This fellow… was indeed worthy of being the craziest person in the Inner Academy.</p>
 <p>Some similar surprise also flashed in Xiao Yan’s eyes. The gaze which he used to look at the gray-clothed man had an additional seriousness. Xiao Yan asked himself and knew that if he was to completely rely on his own strength, he did not have much confidence in successfully snatching this kind of unique object from the hands of two Dou Wang class Magical Beast. This fellow in front of him might be arrogant and wild, but he did indeed have the means to do so.</p>
 <p>“Can you change it to something else? For example exchanging another item for it? I am unable to take out four hundred days of ‘Fire Energy.’” Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment. The Green Wood Celestial Vine was a key ingredient in refining the ‘Ground Spirit Pill.’ Moreover, if he wanted to successfully swallow the ‘Fallen Heart Flame,’ the ‘Ground Spirit Pill’ was something that was indispensable. Hence, no matter what happened, he must obtain all of the necessary medicinal ingredients and Monster Cores needed to refine the ‘Ground Spirit Pill’ in his hands before he obtain the ‘Fallen Heart Flame.’</p>
 <p>The number of medicinal ingredients needed to refine the ‘Ground Spirit Pill’ may not be large, but all of them were extremely rare items. Take for example this Green Wood Celestial Vine. If he was to let it slip by today, Xiao Yan did not know just exactly when will he find it again. Therefore, he would naturally not easily give it up.</p>
 <p>“Yes you can. I need Dou Techniques. Di class ones. Do you have any?” The gray-clothed man did not hesitate with regards to Xiao Yan’s suggestions. He opened his mouth and changed his demands. However, this price once again caused Xiao Yan and the surrounding students to be a little speechless. Di class. It was likely that there were not many students within this Inner Academy who had a Dou Technique of that class.</p>
 <p>Of course, Xiao Yan did indeed possess a kind of Di class Dou Technique. Moreover, it was an Agility type Dou Technique. However, this technique was also something that he needed to practice but did not have the time to do so. Asking him to use it to exchange for the Green Wood Celestial Vine caused him to feel as though it was cutting into his flesh.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face was volatile as it continued to changed rapidly for awhile. Under the focus of the surrounding gazes, he shook his head and slowly said, “I am also unable to take out a Di class Dou Technique…”</p>
 <p>The gray-clothed man glanced at Xiao Yan with disdain. He was too lazy to even say anything as he directly shut his eyes once again and ignored Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Seeing Xiao Yan being humiliated, the surrounding people involuntarily emitted low laughter. They felt that Xiao Yan’s action of bringing himself grief was funny.</p>
 <p>“He does indeed have a strange temperament….” Xiao Yan shook his head helplessly. He ignored the laughter around him and did not simply just leave. After standing for a long while in front of the stone table, a thought suddenly shook his heart. His gaze slowly swept over the body of the gray-clothed man.</p>
 <p>Around two minutes after Xiao Yan’s gaze swept across the gray-clothed man, a powerful force that contained some anger suddenly surged out of the gray-clothed man’s body. Under the sweeping of this powerful force, the expressions of the surrounding students observing the situation drastically changed as they hurriedly stepped back.</p>
 <p>“This fool is going to be out of luck. He actually infuriated that crazy Lin Yan…”</p>
 <p>“He deserves it. He clearly knows that that fellow has the worst patience in the entire Inner Academy yet he actually dares to dawdle. Isn’t he asking for a beating?”</p>
 <p>“But this fellow seems to be quite familiar…”</p>
 <p>On top of stepping back, the surrounding students involuntarily felt some resentment for being implicated into the mess. At that moment, complaints and ridicule sounded.</p>
 <p>Under the powerful fury of that gray-clothed man, Xiao Yan’s expression also changed slightly as he took a step back. His heart was slightly shaken. From just looking at this Qi, it appeared that the strength of this fellow was likely above that of a seven star Dou Ling.</p>
 <p>The fellow’s tightly shut eyes were once again slowly opened. Those reddened pupils of his contained violence and anger. He eyed Xiao Yan and asked in a dark and cold voice, “Are you asking for a beating?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t wish to fight. However, I have quite a bit of interest in this green vine.” Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and laughed softly.</p>
 <p>“Get out of the trading area in one minute.” The gray-clothed man inhaled a deep breath of air. His voice contained some suppressed anger and violence as it shook.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have four hundred days of ‘Fire Energy, and I don’t have a Di class Dou Technique…” Xiao Yan rubbed his head, feeling vexed. However, before all of his words sounded, the aura of the gray-clothed man completely erupted. The latter suddenly stood up. In an instant, he appeared in front of Xiao Yan. Both of his eyes turned red as the sharp wind of his fist nearly tore through the air. There was a faint pale red fist shadow along the path which his fist was swung.</p>
 <p>The aggressive force which came toward Xiao Yan caused his expression to change. His body, however, remained straight as his dark black pupils eyed the pair of eyes that had been corroded by Fire Poison. A calm voice was slowly emitted, “However, I can help you expel the Fire Poison in your body…”</p>
 <p>“Chi…”</p>
 <p>The first which was wrapped by a faint red Dou Qi suddenly stilled just when it was around two inches in front of Xiao Yan’s face. Along with the stiffened fist, was the shocked face of the gray-clothed man.</p>
 <p>“You… what did you say?” The bright redness in his eyes dimmed slightly as the gray-clothed man opened his mouth and asked in a somewhat trembling voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s finger gently touched the fist in front of him. After which, he slowly put it down. Xiao Yan directly looked at this man who appeared to be quite strong within the Inner Academy and said indifferently, “I will help you expel the Fire Poison in you and you give me this green vine. What do you say to this transaction?”</p>
 <p>The expression of the gray-clothed man changed intensely when he once again heard Xiao Yan’s voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was unconcerned about the clash within the gray-clothed man’s heart. He inserted his hands into his sleeves and quietly waited for the other party’s reply.</p>
 <p>This area in the noisy trading area had descended into a temporarily silence. Those numerous gazes shot at Xiao Yan’s body while carrying some shock. This fellow had actually subdued the craziest person within the Inner Academy… it was really somewhat unbelievable.</p>
