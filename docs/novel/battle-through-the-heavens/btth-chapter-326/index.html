 <p><strong><u>Chapter 326: Obtaining the Reward</u></strong></p>
 <p>As Xiao Yan walked out of the corridor, he coincidentally met Ao Tuo’s group who had been waiting for a while. The few of them smiled and chatted a little. During this time, Xue Mei injected a few sentences and the gaze that she used to looked at Xiao Yan was a little strange. Lin Fei, on the other hand was stammering and did not dare speak much. Each time Xiao Yan shot his gaze over, her face would flush. The performance of Xiao Yan a while ago had shocked this energetic girl once over. The original idol in her heart, Liu Ling, was quietly kicked aside. Replacing him was the quiet and thin young man’s back.</p>
 <p>Not long after Xiao Yan conversed with Xue Mei and the others, Ao Tuo forcefully ended their conversation. After which, he led Xiao Yan out of the plaza and swiftly returned to the association. He arranged a quiet room for Xiao Yan, allowing the latter to adjust his condition first. This was because the pale complexion of Xiao Yan was weak to the point of frightening people.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan eyed the room’s door which had been closed and could only helplessly shake his head. He eyed his hand which contained a green colored medicinal pill which Ao Tuo had stuffed toward him. Based off of the luster of the medicinal pill, it was at least a tier three. It appeared that Xiao Yan’s victory this time around had indeed given Ao Tuo great joy. A medicinal pill of this grade could be considered quite precious to him. Currently, however, he had readily handed it back over.</p>
 <p>Once he was seated cross-legged on the soft bed, Xiao Yan took the medicinal pill in his hand and pushed it into his mouth. He felt the pure energy that was swiftly being spread within his body and slowly closed his eyes, beginning to recover his spirit.</p>
 <p>Although he had been forcefully supporting himself, the examination this time around had indeed exhausted all of Xiao Yan’s strength. The consumption of his Spiritual Strength when he changed between three different types of flames was indeed overly great. If it were not because of this earlier condition being extremely good, it was likely that Xiao Yan would have fainted due to the complete exhaustion of his Spiritual Strength before he could finish changing the flame twice.</p>
 <p>In a flash, over five hours had passed while he was recuperating. When Xiao Yan finally woke up from his training mode and glanced at the unlatched window, he realized that the sun, which was originally hanging high in the air, was actually about to descend beyond the horizon. The warm air had also slowly turn cold.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled and rubbed his forehead. He sensed the tiredness and drowsiness withdrawing from his mind. He was a little surprised. Originally, he thought that he would need at least a day’s time in order to recover half of his energy. It was unexpected that he had nearly completely recovered during these five hours. This ought to be the effect of the medicinal pill that Ao Tuo had given him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan placed his palms on the bed and used a little strength. His body leaped forward in a flash and steadily landed on the ground. He then patted his hands gently, feeling satisfied with the speed at which he had recovered.</p>
 <p>“Creak…”</p>
 <p>Not long after Xiao Yan descended from the bed, the room’s door was gently pushed opened. Xiao Yan lifted his head to take a look, only to see a delicate and pretty young lady wearing a trainee alchemist robe carefully walking in while carrying a basin of clear water.</p>
 <p>“Mister Yan Xiao, grandmaster Ao Tuo has instructed me to take care of you here…” The young lady was merely around fourteen or fifteen. She had a very small body, but the tight alchemist robe revealed her slim waist and somewhat bulging chest. Although she had yet to mature, she had a uniqueness about her.</p>
 <p>Currently, her delicate, pretty, small face was a little shy and flushed. A blazing heat flashed in her bright eyes as she stared at Xiao Yan. Earlier, when she had nothing to do, she had quietly went to watch the Grand Meeting competition. Naturally, she had clearly seen Xiao Yan defeating Yan Li and turned the tides, changing the final outcome of the entire Grand Meeting. In the hearts of the young ladies at this age, Xiao Yan was undoubtedly their hero and idol in their hearts. Even though his face was a little ordinary looking, it was filled with charm when they looked at it now.</p>
 <p>The young girl’s heart jumped for joy when she was suddenly instructed by Ao Tuo to guard this place. This was especially so when she recalled the envious gazes of her companions. The temperature of her heated eyes once again rose.</p>
 <p>“*Cough*...” Xiao Yan coughed dryly as he was being stared at by a young girl in such a heated manner. When he recovered, he smiled as he received the basin. “Thanks, but I can do it myself.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Although she felt a little regretful in her heart, the young girl did not dare to refuse. She obediently handed over the basin and stood to the side with her gaze staring unblinkingly at Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan really felt very uncomfortable at being stared at while he washed. Therefore, he simply wiped his face randomly a couple of times before asking in a somewhat helpless manner, “Young miss…”</p>
 <p>“I...I’m called Xun-er.” The young lady said with a red face.</p>
 <p>(TL: This Xun-er is not the Xun Er from the Xiao clan)</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled bitterly, but he only asked, “Miss Xun-er, can you bring me to see chairman Fa Ma now?”</p>
 <p>“Ah. Please follow me.” The little girl who was satisfied crisply replied before turning around and leading the way from the front.</p>
 <p>Once they left the room, Xiao Yan closely followed behind the young girl. The association’s alchemists who occasionally passed by him, would stop and give the former a friendly smile. At times when the stairs were squeezy, many alchemists would even take the initiative to give way. Being treated so courteously caused Xiao Yan to be a little uneasy.</p>
 <p>“Mister Yan Xiao, you really enjoy quite a great prestige. Normally, those people would scowl when they see us, much less give way to us…” As they once again walked past a corridor, the young girl in front of him could not resist laughing softly.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled at these somewhat saucy words of the young girl. The world was realistic. Respect and reverence were forever left for those with the ability to enjoy it. Before this, he too did not receive such treatment when he came to the alchemist association, did he?</p>
 <p>After following the young girl past a few more corridors, Xiao Yan finally came to a stop outside a spacious room. The young girl softly said, “This is the study of the chairman. He should be inside now. Please go in by yourself, Mister Yan Xiao.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you Miss Xun-er.” Xiao Yan nodded his head and smiled as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need…” The young girl smiled sweetly and turned around. She had taken a few steps when she suddenly turned around again and said with another smile, “Mister Yan Xiao, you are really handsome today… hee hee, goodbye.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was at a loss while he eyed the young girl, who had her hands behind her back, bouncing around like a deer as she disappeared at the end of the corridor. Immediately, he let out a smile and shook his head. It appeared that the Grand Meeting had really agglomerated quite a great popularity for him. Even this ordinary looking face could actually cause the young girl to have amorous feelings for him… but it was a pity that this identity and name were false.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan withdrew his gaze and thoughts before he knocked lightly on the door. He waited for Fa Ma’s voice to be emitted from within before he pushed open the door and entered.</p>
 <p>Once he entered the room, Fa Ma, Hai Bo Dong, and Jia Lao, who were seated by the side of the desk, involuntarily threw Xiao Yan a smile when they saw that it was him.</p>
 <p>“Little fellow, congratulations.” As they eyed Xiao Yan entering, Fa Ma’s three men group cupped their hands toward him.</p>
 <p>“All of you should stop ridiculing me.” Xiao Yan slowly walked forward and spoke with a bitter smile, “This affair nearly took this little life of mine.”</p>
 <p>“Ke ke.” Fa Ma laughed softly. He did not say anything unnecessary as his palm stroked the storage ring on his hand. Immediately, a purple-silver colored scroll appeared in his palm. Xiao Yan’s palm slowly rubbed the scroll and he said with a smile, “With effort comes reward. This is the medicinal formula for a tier six medicinal pill, ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’. Little fellow, from now on, it belongs to you.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Fa Ma flicked his finger onto the scroll. The scroll turned into a silver colored shadow that shot toward Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was a little excited as he received the scroll. He could not resist playing with it in his hands. The scroll was both purple and silver in color and had an icy feeling when one held it. On the bright and clean scroll’s surface, there were some complicated lines and ancient markings, giving it an aesthetic feeling when one looked at it. Xiao Yan carefully held the scroll and slowly pulled it open. He roughly glanced at the information written on the scroll and realized that what was written on it was no different from what Ao Tuo had told him. Only then did he sigh in relief.</p>
 <p>“I advise you not to use your Spiritual Strength to read the medicinal formula here. Otherwise, you will faint on the spot. Even if it were me, a tier six medicinal formula is something that would give me a headache for quite a long time after reading it.” Fa Ma reminded as he eyed Xiao Yan’s excited manner.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, I know.” Xiao Yan nodded his head and carefully placed the medicinal formula for the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ into his storage ring. When he raised his head, he saw Fa Ma handing over a piece of purple colored metal plate over and could not help but feel uncertain.</p>
 <p>“This is the token for an honorary elder of the association and is also a kind of reward for the champion. If you take this token, you can obtain help from any association branch in the Jia Ma Empire.” Fa Ma smiled and said, “I know that you do not like to be constrained by any position. This so called honorary elder doesn’t need you to do anything. It is just a hanging title. As long as you are willing, you can ignore anyone’s dispatchment, including me.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly before receiving the token in passing.</p>
 <p>“Alright, little fellow, you have already obtained the reward. Next, you can wander around the association or the capital. Although the Grand Meeting is over, the capital will be quite lively for a period of time. The current you is also a famous person. If you were to walk out, the people who want to be acquainted with you may well have to queue out of this city. Ha ha.” Fa Ma teased.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. His gaze swept over the three of them as he suddenly asked, “You… what are you planning to do?”</p>
 <p>“Ke ke…” Hai Bodong smiled and exchanged glances with Fa Ma and Jia Lao. He then smiled and said, “Next, we plan to go and find that friend Yan Li to discuss the price to pay for breaking the rules of the Grand Meeting…”</p>
 <p>“A pitiful fellow who is destined not to be able to return.” Xiao Yan spread his hands. He did not think that Yan Li would be able to escape alive from the hands of Fa Ma’s three man group.</p>
 <p>“Since the three of you have an appointment to keep, I shall not keep you. I also have some things that I must do. Goodbye…” Xiao Yan cupped his hands at the three people. He did not stay any longer as he turned around and walked out of the room.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, let’s go… during these two day, I have been infuriated by that fellow. Now, it is time to pay.” As he eyed the disappearing back of Xiao Yan, Fa Ma stood up from his chair and spoke with a cold smile.</p>
 <p>Hai Bodong smiled and stood up. The three of them exchanged gazes. As their bodies shook slightly, a violent wind abruptly blew from within the room. The wind blew the books all over the place as they let out a swishing sound (books flying around). When everything finally settled down, the three people in the room were nowhere to be found.</p>
