 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1056: Successful Pill Refinement</u></strong></p>
 <p>Silver lightning rammed down from the sky covered in dark clouds. They rapidly materialized from all over the sky. The entire sky slightly shook at this moment. The dim valley appeared like it was daytime because of the continuously flashing silver lightning. A loud rumbling sound resounded unceasingly over the entire valley.</p>
 <p>A bright-silver-colored figure floated in the sky amid the pouring of the silver lightning from all over. It attracted the surrounding silver lightning to itself!</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom…</p>
 <p>Each silver bolt of lightning that fell from the sky would forcefully cause the silver-colored figure to descend because of the enormous strength present within each bolt. The muffled sound that was emitted when the two made contact caused some people’s heads to turn numb. If it was an ordinary person forcefully receiving the blows head-on, they would have turned into a piece of charcoal.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes intently stared at the Earth Demon Puppet suspended in the sky permeated by lightningbolts. Due to the connection between the two of them, he was able to vaguely sense that the strength of the Earth Demon Puppet was gradually rising amid these silver strikes…</p>
 <p>The Earth Demon Puppet was unable to use Dou Skills. However, it possessed an extremely terrifying physical body. This physical body would not only not be destroyed under the smashing Pill Lightning but would actually end up absorbing the lightning strength within it, strengthening its body that did not feel any pain…</p>
 <p>“The Pill Lightning that is created by a high grade tier 7 medicinal pill is indeed extremely strong. Even with the strength of the Earth Demon Puppet, one would be barely able to block it. However, it is fortunate that the Earth Demon Puppet is able to absorb the strength of the lightningbolt and allow it to gradually get used to the Pill Lightning. Otherwise, even if it did not feel any pain, it would still be unable to endure after being struck by so many silver bolts of lightning…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced at the ferocious, thick layer of dark clouds that did not disappear for a long time. He then involuntarily shook his head and softly muttered to himself.</p>
 <p>“However, it will be soon. The speed at which the Pill Lightning is descending is clearly inferior to its earlier peak…”</p>
 <p>“What a strange puppet. It is likely that this puppet’s fighting strength alone would not be inferior to that of a seven star Dou Zong. Moreover, from the looks of it, this puppet can still absorb lightning power to strengthen itself. If this continues and it ends up experiencing a couple more Pill Lightning, it is likely that even an elite Dou Zun will not be able to do anything to it…”</p>
 <p>On the stone stage, Tang Zhen revealed the surprise in his eyes as the Earth Demon Puppet remained unharmed in the face of so much silver lightning. Such a puppet was something that he had rarely encountered even with his experience.</p>
 <p>“It is really unexpected that Yan Xiao is able to receive this Pill Lightning by just relying on this puppet. This young person really causes one to feel continuously surprised…”</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen let out a soft sigh in his heart. He naturally sensed that the shocking Pill Lightning in the sky was gradually approaching its end.</p>
 <p>Of course, many people present also had such thoughts. Everyone was clearly aware of the might of the Pill Lightning formed by a high grade tier 7 medicinal pill. Each time a medicinal pill of such a tier was born, one would require a couple of elite Dou Zongs to join hands to provide protection during this final Pill Lightning…</p>
 <p>However, the Pill Lightning that had given quite a number of alchemist a headache was easily received by a puppet that Xiao Yan had summoned. This naturally caused quite a number of people to be filled with disbelief. If word of this were to spread, it was likely that even some alchemist gurus would be interested in it. After all, as long as one possessed this strange puppet, one would no longer need to worry about Pill Lightning when refining pills in the future.</p>
 <p>Another loud thunderous roar resounded over the sky while various thoughts were churning through everyone present. A five-foot-large silver lightningbolt cut through the sky with a crackling sound, appearing just like a silver dragon as it did. It ruthlessly smashed into the Earth Demon Puppet.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>This powerful collision ruthlessly smashed the Earth Demon Puppet down. It immediately landed in the square. Rock fragments shot out, revealing an enormous pit that was over a hundred feet in size. Numerous arm-thick crack lines repeatedly spread out like a spiderweb around the deep pit.</p>
 <p>The sudden and unexpected change caused the many Burning Flame Valley’s disciples to hurriedly withdraw as though they had suffered. They immediately looked at the enormous pit and inhaled a deep breath of cool air.</p>
 <p>The thick, dark clouds in the sky gradually ceased churning after emitting this strong silver bolt of lightning. After which, it swiftly thinned. Numerous light rays penetrated through the dark clouds, transforming into a countless number of light spots that landed on the the Burning Flame Valley, which had just experienced the destruction of Pill Lightning.</p>
 <p>The sunlight scattered down and swiftly expelled the darkness within the valley. The shocking lightning’s might from earlier swiftly disappeared as a result.</p>
 <p>Everyone present sighed in relief upon seeing the Pill Lightning disappear. Immediately, numerous gazes were thrown to that enormous deep pit in union. They faced each other. Did it fail at the last moment after having endured so many thunderbolts?</p>
 <p>“Young friend Yan Xiao, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen was also shocked at the last Pill Lightning that had erupted. He looked at the deep bit below before turning to Xiao Yan and hurriedly asking.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was as white as a sheet. He waved his hand, but his laughter appeared to be without strength, “Valley Chief Tang, rest assured…” Xiao Yan’s hand seals changed after speaking. Immediately, a deep sound appeared from the deep pit. A silver-colored human figure rose before steadily landing on the stone stage.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes swiftly landed on the Earth Demon Puppet in front of him. After this Pill Lightning refinement, the bright-silver color on its body appeared exceptionally pure. It was as though the puppet was made of pure silver, making it extremely eye-catching.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand rubbed the Earth Demon Puppet. The icy-cool metallic-like feeling meant its skin was hard. However, the thing that caused Xiao Yan to be somewhat disappointed was that seemed to be unable to find a golden color on the body of the Earth Demon Puppet.</p>
 <p>The Demon Puppet was separated into three grades: Sky, Earth, and Man. It could be differentiated through the color on its surface. The Man grade was bronze in color, Earth grade was silver in color, and Sky grade was gold in colour… currently, the Demon Puppet was bright-silver in color. Clearly, it was still at the Earth grade. When it turned into a golden color, it would finally be truly called the Sky Demon Puppet and not the Earth Demon Puppet.</p>
 <p>Although the puppet did not turn into a golden color, Xiao Yan clearly sensed that the strength of the Earth Demon Puppet had risen after this Pill Lightning refinement. According to his guess, it was likely that the current Earth Demon Puppet would be able to barely put up a fight against an old demon on Fei Tian’s level. One might not dare to say that it would defeat the other party, but it would be a threat against Fei Tian not like in the past.</p>
 <p>“Looks like it is quite difficult for it to advance to the Sky grade…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly sighed. He was just about to store the Earth Demon Puppet into his Storage Ring when his hand suddenly trembled. He stared at the empty eyes of the puppet. There was actually a vague, dark-dull-golden color at that spot.</p>
 <p>“Golden color?”</p>
 <p>Although this thread of golden color had an extremely weak luster, it was exceptionally obvious in the empty eyes of the Earth Demon Puppet. Hence, it did not escape Xiao Yan’s notice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart was somewhat excited as his eyes stared intently at the thread of dark-golden luster. This golden color was extremely faint. Nevertheless, it caused him to identify the advancement method of the Earth Demon Puppet. This method was using the lightning strength within Pill Lightning to refine the Demon Puppet’s body, strengthening it and allowing it to achieve the final quality change.</p>
 <p>“Looks like I need to think of a way to allow the Demon Puppet to absorb Pill Lightning in the future. If it can absorb it and advance into the Sky stage, it will be a great help to me. After all, this is a true trump card. Moreover, the matter of betrayal will never happen.” Xiao Yan suppressed the excitement in his heart and softly muttered within it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan extended his hand after making up his mind. He returned the Earth Demon Puppet in front of him into his Storage Ring. After which, his gaze turned to the interior of the medicinal cauldron. There was a green-red, round medicinal pill that was rotating there. The rich pill fragrance it radiated caused one to feel relaxed and happy.</p>
 <p>“Is this the Fire Bodhisattva Pill…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled as his eyes paused on the green-red medicinal pill within the medicinal cauldron. He flicked his finger and the cauldron cover automatically flew open. Immediately, a green-red glow rushed out of it in a lightning-like manner. It did not pause as it flew into the sky, looking as though it was attempting to flee.</p>
 <p>“Valley Chief Tang, I will leave it to you?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled as he observed the medicinal pill that was attempting to flee. A medicinal pill at this tier had already formed some spirituality. It knew how to avoid danger. Hence, it fled by itself the moment it left the medicinal cauldron.</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen laughed out loud when he heard Xiao Yan’s words. He immediately nodded and grabbed with his palm toward the sky. The space in the fleeing direction of the Fire Bodhisattva Pill solidified. The pill collided with it and rebounded.</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen waved his sleeves and a suction force surged out. He easily swept the Fire Bodhisattva Pill back before he swiftly took out a top quality jade-bottle. After which, he stuffed this green-red pill, that was still attempting to flee, into the bottle.</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen sighed in relief as he held the jade bottle in his hand, appearing as though he had released a heavy burden. His expression was solemn as he turned to Xiao Yan, cupped his hands together, and said in a deep voice, “Young friend Yan Xiao, thank you very much. The old me will remember this favor.”</p>
 <p>“I was also doing as tasked.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan shook his head. An unusually fierce tiredness and frailness suddenly swept out from deep within his soul. Immediately, the area in front of him slowly turned black, causing him to fall from the stone chair head first without any ability to resist it.</p>
 <p>“A high-grade tier 7 medicinal pill is indeed not something so easy to refine…”</p>
 <p>A mutter that carried a bitter laugh sounded within Xiao Yan’s heart just before he fell unconscious…</p>
