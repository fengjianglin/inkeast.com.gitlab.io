 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1072: Turning the Situation Around</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan…”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor was startled as she looked at the young man standing beside the mountain stream. A beautiful smile slowly surfaced on her pale, pretty face. It was the joyous, beautiful smile of someone finding great hope while one was in despair.</p>
 <p>Bing Yuan’s eyes stared at Xiao Yan in a dark and dense manner. His ice-cold voice appeared as though it had risen from hell, “Brat, you dare to meddle in the affairs of my Ice River Valley?</p>
 <p>After scanning the area with his eyes earlier, Bing Yuan had discovered that the dozens of elite Ice River Valley disciples around the mountain stream had been reduced by half. A dense bloody scent spread over the place. Clearly, these missing disciples had already perished to the hands of this person. This result caused an incomparable fury and killing intent to surge in his heart. His eyes were just like that of a ferocious fierce wolf as they stared at Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan merely smiled as he sensed the savage expression in Bing Yuan’s eyes. He casually said, “The people from the Ice River Valley are all really bad apples…”</p>
 <p>“A one star Dou Zong dares to act this insolent in front of me? The young people these days are really becoming more and more arrogant…” Bing Yuan laughed out loud from extreme anger when he heard Xiao Yan’s words. His voice was filled with a dense killing intent, “The old me doesn't care about your background. However, I must inform you that this Fallen God Stream will be your burial ground!”</p>
 <p>“Bing Fu, I’ll leave him to you. Do not hold back. Capture him first and break his limbs.”</p>
 <p>Bing Yuan’s eyes turned to the other side of the mountain valley. There was a white-clothed old man located at that spot. His expression was also staring at Xiao Yan in a dark, solemn manner. Xiao Yan had acted too quickly earlier and had exceeded everyone’s expectations. Within a short half a minute, nearly twenty Ice River Valley’s disciples had fallen to his hands. All of this had progressed in front of him as though he had been slapped in the face, causing him to feel a fiery hot pain.</p>
 <p>“Relax, I will let him understand what it means to suffer a fate worse than death. At the same time, I will let him know that rushing forward into something unrelated to him will not lead to anything good.” That white-clothed, old man called Bing Fu nodded. His old face revealed a cold, savage smile.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor swiftly recovered when Bing Yuan was conversing with Bing Fu. Her pretty eyes swept around her and the joy that had just surfaced immediately scattered. Even though Xiao Yan had hurried over, it would also be difficult for him to rescue her in this kind of situation. Instead, he would end up being implicated. After all, the Ice River Valley had a total of three Dou Zongs in this place. With Xiao Yan’s strength, attempting to successfully flee with her was…</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, leave. I have my own means of escaping. I will think of ways to find you after I escape!” The Little Fairy Doctor suddenly cried out to Xiao Yan after her pretty eyes swiftly flashed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He smiled as his gaze slid to the Little Fairy Doctor and said, “Do you think I will believe you? You can rest assured. Since I dared to come to this place, I naturally have the confidence to rescue you…”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor felt her tense heart relax a little for some unknown reason after seeing the smile on Xiao Yan’s face. She understood Xiao Yan quite well. He had seldom done anything that he was not confident in. It was perhaps as he had said. His heart should have his own plans.</p>
 <p>“The old me really wishes to know just where your confidence comes from.”</p>
 <p>Bing Fu stepped through the empty air and slowly headed toward Xiao Yan. The aura that surged out of his body with each step he took turned colder. A mocking smile also surfaced on his face.</p>
 <p>“Bing Yuan, attack. You should settle the important matter first. We will avoid being punished if any unexpected situation occurs.”</p>
 <p>Bing Yuan slowly nodded. His cold eyes were withdrawn from Xiao Yan. After which, he turned to the Little Fairy Doctor and coldly laughed, “Rest assured that after capturing you, the old me will let you see just what kind of ending such arrogance will meet…” Bing Yuan was unwilling to delay any longer after saying these words. Both of his hands curled and a shockingly cold aura swiftly brewed in his hands. Within the blink of an eye, it agglomerated into a fast spinning ice wheel. The edge of the ice wheel was as sharp as blade, and it immediately emitted a tooting sound.</p>
 <p>“Go!”</p>
 <p>The sharp ice wheel rotated at high speed in Bing Yuan’s hands. A denseness was slowly lifted on the corner of his mouth. He flicked his finger and one could hear a ‘swoosh’ sound. The fast spinning ice wheel penetrated through the air as it appeared in front of the Little Fairy Doctor in a flash. After which, it carried a stern killing intent as it rushed toward her long neck.</p>
 <p>The icy cold wind, that had arrived suddenly, caused the Little Fairy Doctor’s expression to change. Her body moved and quickly hurried back. The speed of the ice wheel was unexpectedly quick as it was swiftly magnified in front of her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The ice wheel cut through the sky. The moment it was about to catch up to the Little Fairy Doctor, a silver glow strangely appeared in front of her. The silver glow flickered and a silver-colored arm and fist swung out. It sent the ice wheel flying.</p>
 <p>This sudden unexpected change caused Bing Yuan’s expression to alter. His face revealed a shocked expression as he looked at the silver figure in front of the Little Fairy Doctor, especially when he saw its empty eyes. He narrowed his eyes and exclaimed, “A puppet?”</p>
 <p>The silver-colored human figure that had suddenly appeared had naturally attracted the attention of the others. Bing Fu’s expression also sank. Although he was unable to detect the puppet’s aura, he could still sense a danger emanating from it..</p>
 <p>“You are already so old. It seems that all these years have grown on your skin (thick skin). You actually used such a vicious blow against a wounded, weak lady.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed from the edge of the mountain stream. However, his laughter contained an ice-cold killing intent. His finger slowly pointed at Bing Yuan. “Kill him!”</p>
 <p>The Earth Demon Puppet, who was in front of the Little Fairy Doctor, immediately rushed out like a cannonball when Xiao Yan’s voice sounded. It appeared in front of Bing Yuan in a flash. Its fist ruthlessly smashed toward his chest without any fanciful moves.</p>
 <p>This swift and fierce attack by the Earth Demon Puppet caused Bing Yuan’s expression to change. He threw a palm out as a reflex action, stirring a cold air that rose from all directions as he did so.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The fist and palm made contact, but the Earth Demon Puppet did not move even a little. On the other hand, Bing Yuan’s throat let out a groan as he took a couple of quick steps back through the empty air. A shock finally surged into his eyes. With his strength, he was unable to obtain the upper hand in a head-on clash with this mysterious puppet?</p>
 <p>“Bing Fu, kill that brat. He is controlling the puppet!”</p>
 <p>Bing Yuan stabilized his body before he let out a roar. His face was furiously green when he did so.</p>
 <p>Bing Fu’s expression slightly changed when he heard Bing Yuan’s roar. It seemed that this puppet was indeed extremely troublesome. Immediately, he turned his eyes toward Xiao Yan. His eyes were filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>When Bing Fu turned his cold eyes to Xiao Yan, a figure hurriedly rushed over from the mountain stream. After which, she appeared in front of Xiao Yan and said in a solemn voice, “Leave him to me, you should deal with the others…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head when he saw this. He extended his hand and pulled the Little Fairy Doctor behind him. After which, he softly said, “There are still injuries in your body. It is best that you take a rest first. These people alone will not be able to do much…”</p>
 <p>“What an arrogant tone! Bing He, you will lead the others to capture the Woeful Poison Lady. Leave this person to me!”</p>
 <p>Bing Fu furiously laughed out loud. He clenched his hand, and a cold air surged from it. A long spear that was formed from ice appeared in his hand. The body of the spear shook and formed numerous afterimages. After letting out a furious laugh, Bing Fu’s body moved, transforming into a white figure that shot toward Xiao Yan in a lightning-like manner. The long spear cut through the air, bringing with it an ear-piercing sound.</p>
 <p>The last white-clothed, old man from the Ice River Valley nodded after hearing Bing He’s cry. He quickly waved his hand and lead dozens of figures toward the Little Fairy Doctor behind Xiao Yan with a ‘swoosh’ sound. This place turned extremely cold in an instant!</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor’s face involuntarily became tense when she saw Bing Fu attacking. The Dou Qi in her body swiftly surged.</p>
 <p>“There is indeed no other puppet. However, there is a special spiritual body…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled as he looked at the cold face of Bing Fu. His finger gently rubbed the white-colored ring on his finger. An illusionary spiritual body slowly appeared and turned into the shape of an elderly man.</p>
 <p>Bing Fu, who was charging forward, suddenly halted when the spiritual body appeared. His eyes looked at the spiritual body with shock.</p>
 <p>After Bing Fu halted, Bing He’s group, which was following close behind, also stopped. They looked at each other as they did so. Even with their eyesight, they were unable to see through Tian Huo zun-zhe.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, you little fellow. You are asking these old bones of mine to come out and be a fighter again…”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe twisted his body after appearing. After which, he turned to Xiao Yan and helplessly shook his head.</p>
 <p>Surprise flashed through the eyes of the Little Fairy Doctor behind Xiao Yan when she saw him summon such a powerful spiritual body. Her heart completely relaxed. Following this relaxation, the injuries within her body that had been suppressed by her were also released. A giddiness appeared within her head as a mouthful of fresh blood was uncontrollably spat out.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor, who had suddenly spat out blood, startled Xiao Yan. He hurriedly grabbed hold of her and looked at her pale face. She seemed as though she would collapse from a single gust of wind. The killing intent in his dark-black eyes surged.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. He turned his head to Tian Huo zun-zhe. That voice of his contained a denseness, “I will be troubling you, old mister Yao. Please finish off these people as soon as possible. The Little Fairy Doctor is seriously injured and cannot last for long…”</p>
 <p>“Ten minutes.”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe glanced at the Little Fairy Doctor, who was supported by Xiao Yan. With his eyesight, he was naturally able to tell that she had suffered serious injuries. His expression also became a lot more serious. After nodding slightly, he turned around and looked at Bing Fu’s group. All of them were wearing a surprised expression. His foot slowly stepped forward, and a majestic spiritual storm immediately swept out with him at the center!</p>
 <p>The expression of the shocked Bing Fu changed drastically when the spiritual storm erupted. His voice had become a little sharp in his horror.</p>
 <p>“Eight star Dou Zong?”</p>
