 <p><strong><u>Chapter 928: Refining the Sky Demon Puppet</u></strong></p>
 <p>A murky blood fog surged in all directions from the white-colored ring. It swiftly agglomerated into a blood-colored figure within the cave.</p>
 <p>This figure had just appeared when an unusually dense stench spread out. However, the two people within the cave were not ordinary people. This kind of negative emotion did not successfully corrode their mind.</p>
 <p>The fierce spirit had just appeared when it saw Xiao Yan and Tian Huo zun-zhe. Perhaps because it had been captured the last time it saw these people, but it actually did not pounce on them. Instead, it turned around, transformed into a blood shadow that wildly shot out of the cave. It appeared to be afraid of them and was actually attempting to flee.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, you wish to escape?”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe let out a cold snort upon seeing the actions of the fierce spirit. His hand was clenched and the Fallen Heart Flame in front of him swiftly spread out. It transformed into a fire web as it rushed out. Finally, it managed to seal the cave exit just before the blood figure reached it.</p>
 <p>Fear flashed across the blood-colored eyes of the fierce spirit when it saw the invisible fire web. Although it lacked intelligence, its instincts told it that this invisible fire web in front of it would cause it great harm.</p>
 <p>The rushing blood figure forcefully halted its charging body amid an ear-piercing screech. After which, it stilled its body at a spot only five feet from the fire web.</p>
 <p>The body came to a stop, but before the blood figure could rejoice, Tian Huo zun-zhe waved his sleeves. One could watch as the fire web fell before turning into a something like a hungry wolf, charging forward. The web wrapped around the fierce spirit, which could not withdraw in time.</p>
 <p>Chi! Chi!</p>
 <p>The fire web had just made contact with the fierce spirit’s body when it immediately emitted waves of white fog. A ‘chi chi’ sound repeatedly appeared. It was also accompanied by the all out struggle of the fierce spirit. Although it did not possess any intelligence, the Fallen Heart Flame could affect its spirit. It was difficult to avoid this kind of searing pain that originated in one’s spirit.</p>
 <p>Waves of viscous blood-colored fog surged from the fierce spirit’s body as it struggled. After which, the fog collided with the surrounding invisible fire web. They began to fiercely and ruthlessly erode each other.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>A cold expression flashed across Tian Huo zun-zhe’s eyes when he saw the retaliation of the fierce spirit. His hand suddenly changed and the fire web began to slowly shrink. While this fire web was shrinking, the fierce spirit’s body within it also became smaller.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, increase the strength of the Fallen Heart Flame!”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe suddenly cried out as he stared at the shrinking fire web.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, who had already been waiting for orders by the side, immediately nodded his head upon hearing this. He flicked his finger and a wave of Dou Qi shot out. Finally, it landed on the fire web. The Dou Qi was swiftly swallowed by the fire web. Following the fire web’s consumption of Dou Qi, the invisible flame lingering on its surface became denser. On the other hand, the fierce spirit within repeatedly emitted a furious screech because of the grilling. No matter how intensely it struggled, it was too difficult to escape from the fire web’s restraints.</p>
 <p>“Continue to strengthen it!” Tian Huo zun-zhe glanced at the spirit that was still struggling and commanded in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was calm. His ten fingers flicked repeatedly and numerous Dou Qi pillars erupted. Finally, they completely merged with the fire web. With the addition of more Dou Qi, the temperature of the Fallen Heart Flame became frightening. In the end, the fierce spirit finally erupted amid a sharp miserable cry, and transformed into a viscous blood-colored fog that drifted within the fire web.</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe sighed in relief upon seeing this scene. The seal on his hand changed and the fire web gradually scattered. It soon agglomerated into a ten-foot-large cauldron made of flames. The cluster of viscous blood-colored fog was stuck within the cauldron.</p>
 <p>Surprise also flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he studied Tian Huo zun-zhe’s ingenious method of agglomerating a flame cauldron. He was indeed worthy of previously being an elite Dou Zun. Xiao Yan admitted that his flame controlling method was far inferior to his. Tian Huo zun-zhe was really deserving of his name.</p>
 <p>TL: Tian Huo - means sky fire</p>
 <p>The temperature within the fire cauldron was extremely frightening. By being refined under that high temperature, the cluster of viscous blood fog slowly became pale. Xiao Yan knew that as long as the blood color within it was completely refined away, the fierce spirit would have been successfully refined into a cluster of extremely pure Spiritual Strength...</p>
 <p>However, the process of such a refinement was somewhat slow. It was likely that one would have difficulty completely refining the fierce spirit at this speed without at least three to four days…</p>
 <p>“Alright, next, I will need you to help me maintain this fire cauldron. The current me is unable to maintain the exhaustion of this fire cauldron.” Tian Huo zun-zhe’s face revealed a smile as he looked at the blood-colored fog, slowly being refined within the fire cauldron. After which, he smiled as he spoke to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Aye, old mister Yao, you can just relax.” Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. The flame was controlled by Tian Huo zun-zhe. All he needed to do was to provide enough Dou Qi to maneuver the Fallen Heart Flame. This did not drain too much of his mental strength.</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe also smiled and nodded when he heard this. After which, he slowly shut his eyes and sat cross-legged in the air. A thread of Spiritual Strength came out and controlled the flame within the fire cauldron to proceed with the refinement.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan once again poured in a wave of Dou Qi into the fire cauldron upon seeing Tian Huo zun-zhe shut his eyes. After which, he clenched his hand and an ordinary grayish-brown bamboo scroll appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>“Sky Demon Puppet.”</p>
 <p>This scroll was naturally a treasure that Xiao Yan had obtained from raiding the Demon Flame Valley storehouse. The puppet skill that was recorded on it caused him to be very curious.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s finger slowly flipped open the scroll. Those words written on it began to enter Xiao Yan’s head one at a time before leaving behind a deep memory that was difficult to remove.</p>
 <p>The cave slowly descended into silence. Tian Huo zun-zhe was focusing his attention on the flame that was refining the fierce spirit while Xiao Yan had thrown his attention to the mysterious world that was recorded within the bamboo scroll.</p>
 <p>This quiet atmosphere continued for around an hour or so before Xiao Yan recovered from Tian Huo zun-zhe’s urging voice. He immediately gave an embarrassed smile and hurriedly summoned a wave of Dou Qi to throw into the fire cauldron.</p>
 <p>After this one hour of study, Xiao Yan also gained some understanding of this ‘Sky Demon Puppet.’ If one wanted to refine this thing, one would have to possess the three key ingredients written in the introduction: a corpse, a Monster Core, and a spirit. Of course, other than these, one would require some special metallic materials in order to make the puppet’s body even tougher.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan tapped the bamboo scroll softly on his arm. He gradually descended deep into thought. He was basically in possession of all of these things. For a corpse, he had Yun Shan’s and the Old Ground Demon Ghost’s body. For a Monster Core, the rank 7 fire affinity Monster Core should be able to do the trick. For a spirit, the Protector Tie from the ‘Hall of Souls’ he had obtained from the Chu Yun Empire back then was the best replacement. Xiao Yan also possessed some special metallic materials in his Storage Ring. Because he was an alchemist, it was his habit to collect various things.</p>
 <p>A cold glint suddenly flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he thought of about spirits. He shook his hand and a jade bottle with a faint invisible flame covering its mouth appeared in his hand. There was a thread of spiritual ripple faintly seeping out from it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s finger rubbed the bottle’s mouth and eliminated the layer of flame. He kept his eyes shut and a Spiritual Strength carried a voice that was transmitted into the jade bottle.</p>
 <p>“Han Feng, do you know the place where the ‘Hall of Souls’ has imprisoned teacher?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, Xiao Yan, do you wish to rescue that old fellow who will not die? Stop dreaming. This little ability of yours is like an ant if you were to meet the true experts from the ‘Hall of Souls.’ Hee hee, if you really wish to know, you can let me out and beg me properly. Perhaps, I might suddenly be merciful and reveal a little information to you!” An arrogant laugh sounded from the jade bottle.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face remained indifferent. He did not waste his breath. With a flick of his finger, a wisp of jade-green flame entered the jade bottle. Soon a miserable ear-piercing scream was transmitted from the jade bottle.</p>
 <p>“Stop burning. What do you want to know? We can discuss the matter slowly!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ignored the terrified cry within the jade bottle. With a wipe of his finger, a thin flame once again sealed the bottle’s mouth. He then assessed the jade bottle before putting it back into his Storage Ring. When dealing with such a person, it would be easier to talk if he was allowed to suffer a little.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced at the fire cauldron after doing all this. The viscous blood fog within it had paled quite significantly. Clearly, the refinement was progressing quite well.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze shifted away from the fire cauldron. He played with the bamboo scroll on his hand, hesitated for a moment, and stored it within his Storage Ring, Currently, he still needed to take care of the fire cauldron. Hence, it was not the best time to refine other things. It would not be too late to wait until after he had completely refined the fierce spirit before starting.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ceased hesitating after having made his decision within his heart. He exhaled a gentle breath, sat cross-legged, and began to absorb energy to replenish the exhaustion within his body.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Three days of quiet refinement passed by in a flash…</p>
 <p>On this day, the two people in the cave who had their eyes shut opened them together without any prior agreement. Their gazes were thrown to the fire cauldron floating in the air. Both of them sensed that the viscous blood-colored fog had completely scattered. Replacing it was a cluster of chaotic vapor. Xiao Yan sensed an extremely dense Spiritual Strength in that vapor.</p>
 <p>“It has finally been successfully refined…”</p>
 <p>An excited expression flashed across Tian Huo zun-zhe’s eyes as he stared at the invisible gas. He moved his hand and the fire cauldron collapsed. It immediately transformed into a cluster of invisible flame, that rushed to Xiao Yan before entering his body.</p>
 <p>That cluster of chaotic gas was swallowed by Tian Huo zun-zhe after it approached him. His figure then shook and transformed into a white glow that entered the white-colored ring.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, Xiao Yan, words cannot thank such a great favor. The old me will come and return this favor after completely absorbing this Spiritual Strength. Additionally, the time I need for this absorption might be somewhat long. You should be more careful.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also smiled when he heard Tian Huo zun-zhe’s laughter. He nodded slightly and lifted his head to look at the empty cave. He laughed softly, “In that case, I shall refine the ‘Sky Demon Puppet’…”</p>
