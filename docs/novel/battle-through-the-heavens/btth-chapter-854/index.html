 <p><strong><u>Chapter 854: Rank 7 Monster Core</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes were heated as he looked over the enormous Magical Beast’s rotten skin and its shriveled head. Although this thing seemed no different than a pile of garbage, Xiao Yan already knew from his refinements earlier that this mysterious Magical Beast corpse was different than an ordinary Magical Beast. All of its treasures were hidden in places where an ordinary person would have difficulty finding unless they used an unusual method.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeves and a soft wind blew the Magical Beast’s skin until it floated in the air. He flicked his finger and a jade-green flame spluttered from his fingertip. Finally, it turned into a fierce flame that burned beneath the floating skin.</p>
 <p>The enormous skin began to slowly shrink under the grilling of the jade-green flame. However, the expected Monster Core did not appear.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly frowned when he saw this. After being scorched by the ‘Heavenly Flame’, this Magical Beast’s skin began to reveal something a little different. Despite the latter’s weakened form, it was actually able to endure this long above the ‘Heavenly Flame’ without turning into ashes. The only transformation was that it was like the curling of a snake’s skin.</p>
 <p>With the flow of time, the originally large Magical Beast’s skin had already shrunk like a rolling picture. However, the Monster Core Xiao Yan anticipated did not show any signs of appearing.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xiao Yan finally understood that this method of his seemed to be a little wrong…</p>
 <p>He wonder what he was doing wrong. In the end, he could only turn his head to throw his gaze at Zi Yan. He only saw that see the latter was gloatingly staring at his perspiration-filled body.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, if you continue to watch the show, return to me those ten bone spikes.” Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and viciously spoke.</p>
 <p>Zi Yan curled her small mouth in the face of Xiao Yan’s threat. She lazily said, “Stupid, the energy of the Monster Core is indeed hidden in the Magical Beast’s skin. However, if you brutally use a ‘Heavenly Flame’ to grill it, all you will do is cause the energy within to gradually evaporate. In the end, this thing really will become something useless.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand immediately shook when he heard this. The jade-green flame that spread out instantly disappeared. He furiously cried, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”</p>
 <p>“You simply acted without asking me, yet you dare be angry with me now.” Zi Yan spread her small hands and replied with the great grievances she felt.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was infuriated by this girl until he rolled his eyes. A moment later, he could only inhale a breath of air and say with bitter smile, “Little grandaunt, please stop playing with me. Hurry up and tell me what to do.”</p>
 <p>Zi Yan’s pushed her small lips out and snorted with great unwillingness, “Use a drop of that green-red blood on the dry skin. After that, use the ‘Heavenly Flame’ to grill it. That way, the Monster Core can be forced out.”</p>
 <p>“Are you certain?” Xiao Yan began to hesitate a little. He cautiously questioned her when he heard that he needed to use the rare green-red blood.</p>
 <p>“You can forget it if you don’t believe me.” Zi Yan was extremely unhappy about Xiao Yan’s doubt. She smacked her lips and said, “You can grill it by yourself. I will watch where you go to cry after destroying all of the energy hidden in it.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth and immediately said, “Forget it. I will trust you this once.” Xiao Yan’s hand flipped after his voice sounded. The jade bottle from earlier appeared in his hand. He curled his finger and a drop of the green-red blood flew out. Finally, it floated in front of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily felt some pain while he stared at this drop of green-red blood that contained a shocking wild and violent energy. He had only ended up obtaining five drops after refining all of the Magical Beast’s flesh. In the end, he would have to use one drop of it at this moment. If not for that Monster Core, he would not spend such a luxury even if he was beaten to death.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan endured the pain and flicked his finger. The green-red blood flew out before landing on the Magical Beast’s skin that was curling together.</p>
 <p>The green-red blood had just landed on the dry skin when it swiftly entered it. The dry skin, that contained a grayish-white color, appeared to have suffered an intense stimulation as it began to wiggle like a snake. A green-red color swiftly spread from the spot where the blood had landed.</p>
 <p>This green-red color spread at an extremely fast rate. Within a couple of blinks, the dry skin was completely transformed. The grayish-white color had been replaced by an unusual green-red color. It was completely different from its earlier self. Moreover, the completely silent dry skin emitted a shocking energy ripple while the green-red color spread.</p>
 <p>Joy surfaced in Xiao Yan’s eyes when he saw this transformation. This method had indeed been effective.</p>
 <p>“Why aren’t you using the ‘Heavenly Flame’ to refine it? Do you want to wait for the energy to scatter?” Zi Yan coldly snorted.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. The flame immediately moved with his thoughts, and a jade-green flame was once again strutted out. It immediately wrapped around the dry skin that had changed color.</p>
 <p>Following the burning this time around, a situation that was similar to the scene earlier ceased to appear. Instead, the green-red Magical Beast skin began to slowly emit threads of green-red fog as it melted under the high temperature of the ‘Heavenly Flame’. Xiao Yan sensed a frightening energy ripple through this fog.</p>
 <p>Joy flashed through Xiao Yan’s eyes when he observed this scene. He quickly increased the temperature of the ‘Heavenly Flame’.</p>
 <p>The green-red fog that seeped out of the Magical Beast’s skin began to become denser following the intense burning of the jade-green flame. In the end, it almost permeated the air in the room. The majestic energy ripples began to grow more intense following the increase in the density of the green-red fog. In the end, the green-red fog lingered in the room like clouds. It emitted a frightening energy pressure that caused Xiao Yan’s and Zi Yan’s expressions to change.</p>
 <p>“What a frightening energy pressure…” Xiao Yan’s expression was solemn as he looked at the green-red clouds in the air. He pulled Zi Yan behind him and a thought passed through his mind. The Glazed Lotus Heart Flame that was wrapped around the Magical Beast skin became increasingly more hot and wild.</p>
 <p>More and more of the green-red energy fog seeped from the Magical Beast’s skin as the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame blazed. The energy fog gathered without scattering. It lingered in the air above the room. An kind of unusually low, deep roar faintly sounded from within it.</p>
 <p>The blood in Xiao Yan’s body involuntarily began to show signs of boiling when the roar sounded. It shocked him to the point where he hurriedly circulated his Dou Qi to suppress this agitation.</p>
 <p>An energy movement was suddenly transmitted from behind Xiao Yan after he had just suppressed the agitation within his body. He suddenly turned around only to see that Zi Yan’s body had gained a layer of purple light. Under this layer of strange purple light, even Xiao Yan could sense the hint of a dangerous aura. Moreover, her pained gem-like pupils also hid a purple glint. Her gaze carried the threads of her wild nature as she stared intently at the cluster of green-red clouds in the air. It seemed as though she was facing some great enemy in the cloud.</p>
 <p>“Zi Yan!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hurriedly cried out when he saw this unusual situation. The cry that contained Dou Qi blasted Zi Yan’s ears, shaking her until she awoke.</p>
 <p>With the recovery of Zi Yan’s consciousness, the purple glow that lingered around her body slowly disappeared. She glanced at Xiao Yan with eyes that were at a lost before muttering, “What is it?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression gradually turned solemn when he saw her lost manner. In his heart, he clearly knew that this mysterious Magical Beast’s corpse was definitely not an ordinary thing. Moreover, it might have some relation with Zi Yan’s actual form.</p>
 <p>“Just what kind of Magical Beast is this thing? Despite having been dead for so many years, such a frightening energy and pressure still remains.” Xiao Yan knit his brows together as these thoughts flashed across his heart.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>A slight ‘chi chi’ noise suddenly sounded in the room while this thought flashed in Xiao Yan’s mind. His eyes moved to the sound. He looked over only to see that the Magical Beast’s dry skin, being burned by the ‘Heavenly Flame,’ had completely turned to ashes. They scattered through the air, forming a thin layer of gray ash that covered the ground.</p>
 <p>Following the disappearance of the Magical Beast’s skin, the last thread of the green-red fog slowly drifted into that thick green-red cloud.</p>
 <p>This thread of green-red fog had just entered the green-red cloud when the latter began to ripple. One could see a small vortex appearing in the middle of the cloud. That cloud also followed its rotation as it slowly began to spin.</p>
 <p>Threads of majestic, wild, violent energy began to enter the vortex in the middle as the cloud rotated. Following the energy’s entrance, the size of the green-red cloud began to slowly shrink at a speed visible to the naked eye…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not feel too much joy as observed this change. Instead, his expression was solemn as he pulled Zi Yan two steps back. The Dou Qi within his body began to swiftly circulate, ready to deal with any sudden scenario.</p>
 <p>However, the troublesome matter that Xiao Yan had expected did not appear. The vortex’s rotation speed began to quicken. The final thread of the green-red cloud was absorbed into that vortex.</p>
 <p>The vortex suddenly paused after the final layer of the green-red cloud disappeared. Immediately, glaring green-red glow erupted from within it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeve when he saw this sudden change. A layer of jade-green flame appeared in front of him. He narrowed his eyes, and watched the spot where the intense light was emitted.</p>
 <p>The eruption of the intense light merely lasted for an instant before it slowly disappeared. Xiao Yan’s eyes were gradually opened following the scattering of the last thread of light, only for his gaze to suddenly stiffened.</p>
 <p>A green-red somewhat uneven-shaped crystal body was suspended in the the air without any support in front of Xiao Yan’s eyes. A faint green-red glow was emitted as it slowly rotated. Just this mere light energy that had overflowed from it caused the surrounding space to show some signs of distortion.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s stared at this crystal body that clearly contained an extremely frightening energy. He inhaled a deep breath of air and a shocking heat erupted from his eyes.</p>
 <p>“This… is this its Monster Core?”</p>
