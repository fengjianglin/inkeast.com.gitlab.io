 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1348: Purple Sky Demon Puppet</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Leave quickly!”</p>
 <p>Hun Ya’s expression changed the moment Xiao Yan’s body turned into nothing. A cry sounded, and his body immediately turned around without any hesitation and tried to rush into the distance. The dark-and-gloomy-faced Hun Li quickly followed behind. The ambush that the two of them had put in a lot of effort to place not only failed, but they had landed within a trap set by Xiao Yan’s duo.</p>
 <p>“Since you have come, why are you in such a hurry to leave?”</p>
 <p>However, the two of them had just turned around when a figure slowly appeared behind them. Looking at that smiling face, who else could it be other than Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Get lost!”</p>
 <p>Hun Ya’s expression sank when he saw Xiao Yan blocking him. He shook his sleeve, and a thick dark-black chain shot out like a poisonous snake. It emitted the sound of whistling wind as it shot directly toward Xiao Yan’s head.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled when he saw Hun Ya attack. His foot stomped on empty air and the ground suddenly exploded. A ten-foot-large lava pillar shot toward the sky before violently colliding with the dark-black chain.</p>
 <p>While Hun Ya and Hun Li were being blocked by Xiao Yan, Xun Er quickly retrieve that nine star energy core. Her body flashed and appeared behind Hun Ya’s duo. She explained with a cold smile, “We felt that it was strange. A nine star energy body is quite rare. The both of you would not let a nine star energy body go, yet why is it that the both of you did not do anything because you guys had planned an ambush…”</p>
 <p>Hun Ya’s and Hun Li’s expressions became gloomy. Their eyes were filled with a dense cold.</p>
 <p>“You have also become tired after fleeing for nearly half a month, right?” Xiao Yan faintly laughed.</p>
 <p>“We are indeed a little irritated. The sneak attack was merely an attempt to save our strength. Since this didn’t work, we shall just kill you…” Hun Ya’s face was dark and dense. He turned his head and said, “I will stop her. Xiao Yan will be left to you!”</p>
 <p>“Relax, I suffered a loss last time because I was caught off-guard. This time around, I will hack off both of his arms!” Hun Ya spoke with a ferocious smile. His strength was not weaker than Gu Yao. Adding the strange techniques of the Hun clan, it should not be too difficult for him to kill Xiao Yan as long as Xiao Yan was not given the chance to unleash that extremely powerful Tian class Dou Skill or that Fire Lotus Dou Skill.</p>
 <p>“Aye.” Hun Ya nodded. His eyes were cold as they looked at Xiao Yan. After which, he suddenly turned his body. A majestic dark-black Dou Qi surged out. His body turned into a lightning that rushed toward Xun Er.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan ge-ge, be careful! Give me a little time!”</p>
 <p>Xun Er’s pretty eyes turned cold when she saw Hun Ya charging over. She let out a soft cry as a golden flame suddenly rose on her hand. She collided with Hun Ya without giving way.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled a breath of air as he watched the two begin to fight. His eyes were calm as he observed the ferocious-looking Hun Li. Hun Li was an eight star Dou Zun class. However, he had lost an arm, and his fighting strength had weakened. On the other hand, Xiao Yan’s strength had risen by one star when he had exchanged blows with Gu Yao back then. Hence, it would likely not be easy for Hun Li to finish him off.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, you might have been able to defeat Gu Yao, but you might not be able to defeat me! I will definitely take revenge for my lost arm today!”</p>
 <p>A cold black fog suddenly surged from Hun Li’s body after his voice sounded. Numerous dark-black chains shot out. They easily penetrated the air as they shot toward Xiao Yan from all directions.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression did not change when all these dark-black chains came from every direction. He flicked his ten fingers and numerous purple-brown flames, with a dense-white colour mixed in, rushed out. They flew through the sky like fire rain and violently collided with those dark-black chains in the air. They appeared like brilliant fireworks that exploded apart.</p>
 <p>“If it’s just an attack of such a degree, I’m afraid that you will have to take your words back…” Xiao Yan smiled and berated him as he watched the fireworks explode.</p>
 <p>Hun Li’s face was dark and solemn. However, he ignored Xiao Yan. Both of his hands formed some unusual seals with lightning-like speed. After the formation of these seals, one could see a black swirl suddenly appear on his forehead. The swirl rotated as an unusual symbol quietly appeared between Hun Li’s brows.</p>
 <p>“It is your blessing to get me to use the clan tattoo to finish you off!”</p>
 <p>Hun Li’s aura suddenly soared with the appearance of this unusual clan tattoo. Dense black fog saturated his body. The fog appeared to have become solid. His empty right sleeve shook and a dark-black arm extended from his sleeve. If one were to look carefully, one would discover that the arm was covered with numerous ferocious and stern faces. This hand was formed from souls!</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, are you surprised? This kind of clan tattoo is something that your lost Xiao clan does not have the qualification to possess!” Hun Li coldly laughed when he saw the grave expression on Xiao Yan’s face. The members from ancient clans would usually not practice a strengthening technique like the Skyfire Three Mysterious Flame because their clan tattoos were the most powerful Secret Techniques in the world!</p>
 <p>Although these Secret Techniques would exhaust one, they would not harm their body even a little. Suffering a backlash from this Secret Technique would never happen. By being in possession of such a mysterious clan tattoo, those other Secret Techniques that relied on exhausting one’s blood or self-mutilation in order to increase one’s strength were not worth mentioning in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly frowned. He did not expect this clan tattoo to possess such an effect. If Gu Yao had been able to activate his clan tattoo when fighting Xiao Yan, it would have been extremely difficult to predict the victor.</p>
 <p>“Alright, Xiao Yan. Next, I shall let you taste what is called true despair!”</p>
 <p>The black fog expanded while Hun Li’s ferociousness scar-covered face became even more intense. His aura had reached the peak of the eighth star of the Dou Zun class, and it even seemed to vaguely reach the ninth star. This strength had far surpassed Xiao Yan!</p>
 <p>The black fog around Hun Li’s body suddenly exploded after his words sounded. His body disappeared in a strange manner.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The moment Hun Li’s figure disappeared, Xiao Yan’s fist, which was covered by a purple flame, was smashed toward the space behind him. Threads of black fog spread out from space just before his fist could make contact, easily blocking his fist.</p>
 <p>“What a weak attack!”</p>
 <p>The black fog surged out. In the blink of an eye, it formed Hun Li’s figure. His eyes glanced at Xiao Yan in front of him with disdain before he spoke in an indifferent voice.</p>
 <p>“Skyfire Three Mysterious Change! First Change! Second Change! Third Change!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air within his heart. He activated the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change to its limit in an instant. When the Dou Qi within Xiao Yan’s body soared this time around, he suddenly sensed a vague itchy feeling from between his brows. This kind of feeling disappeared in a flash, causing him to think that it was just a momentary illusion.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The Skyfire Three Mysterious Change was unleashed. His palm twisted and escaped like a loach. At the same time, his body explosively pulled back.</p>
 <p>“This is…”</p>
 <p>Hun Li was stunned when Xiao Yan’s body pulled back. His eyes stared intently at the spot between Xiao Yan’s brows. When Xiao Yan had used the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change earlier, he had caught a glimpse of a strange symbol partially visible on Xiao Yan’s forehead. Being from the Hun clan, Hun Ya did not find that symbol unfamiliar because it represented the greatest enemy of the Hun clan back then. The clan tattoo of the Xiao clan!</p>
 <p>“Earlier, that was… the clan tattoo of the Xiao clan? How is that possible? The bloodline of the Xiao clan has been wasted. How can it still possess the clan tattoo? I must have seen wrong!”</p>
 <p>One could not blame Hun Li for acting out of sorts. A clan tattoo was something that only the eight ancient clans possessed because it was activated through the strength of the bloodline. However, the current Xiao clan’s bloodline had long since been wasted. It was impossible for them to possess something like the clan tattoo!</p>
 <p>“Who cares whether I saw it or not. This brat has too many tricks. I should kill him before deciding anything else! Hun Ya will not be able to hold on for long. That girl from the Gu clan is really too powerful.”</p>
 <p>Hun Li’s eyes flickered before a ferocious expression appeared. A mighty ocean-like Dou Qi erupted from his body. That frightening strength scattered the energy fog within a thousand-foot-radius.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, hand over your life!”</p>
 <p>Dou Qi surged while Hun Li stood mightily in the sky, appearing like a demon god. His body moved, accompanied by a cluster of chilly black clouds. He shot toward Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly inhaled a breath of air as he watched Hun Li rush over. This fellow’s strength had soared after borrowing the strength of the clan tattoo. He was even a little stronger than Gu Yao. If Xiao Yan were to fight head-on, it would be an intense battle.</p>
 <p>“It is time to test the might of this thing…”</p>
 <p>A light flickered within Xiao Yan’s eyes. A moment later, the seal formed by his hands suddenly changed!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The ground below suddenly exploded when Xiao Yan’s hand seal changed. The soil spluttered as a golden light immediately pooled together. Numerous golden-yellow figures stood just like statues within the deep pit. They were the Sky Demon Puppets that Xiao Yan had strengthened in the lightning pool back in the empty realm.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The golden light surged and gathered on the first golden figure. The light within the first figure’s body was completely withdrawn. The skin on its body turned from a dark-golden to a mysterious purple. It was possible to see golden light flowing under this purple color.</p>
 <p>After the golden light was completely absorbed, the eyes of the purple Sky Demon Puppet were suddenly opened. A dark-golden light slowly rotated within them. Its body paused and appeared in front of Xiao Yan in the air. Those eyes were indifferent as they looked at the black cloud rushing over. A golden light quietly flowed under its skin.</p>
 <p>Having absorbed the strength of ten Sky Demon Puppets, the strength of this Demon Puppet had alrreached a frightening level!</p>
