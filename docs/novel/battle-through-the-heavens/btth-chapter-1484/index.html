 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1484: Two Star Dou Zun!</u></strong></p>
 <p>The concept of time became extremely blurry within the completely quiet room as a sandalwood fragrance slowly drifted. It was filled with a scent that braced one’s attention. Time quietly flowed by amid this atmosphere of leisure.</p>
 <p>Three months—</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sat in his retreat for three full months. Even he himself would not have expected it to take so long, but he had completely forgotten about time in his slumber. He had been submerged in the beautiful feeling of tempering his physical body.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly sat on the cold jade bed within the quiet room. His skin was revealing a faint purple color. It was vaguely possible to see a faint purple-red color under his skin. An extremely powerful fluctuation spread from this purple-red flow.</p>
 <p>The glow flickered. At this moment, this glow was spreading around Xiao Yan’s body. Circular purple-red glows spread from his heart and reached every single corner of his body…</p>
 <p>This glow continued to flow around his body for three months!</p>
 <p>The three months of tempering dyed Xiao Yan’s originally pale skin a purple-red color. Even his black hair had vaguely turned a little red. He appeared like demon with just a glance.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was not only Xiao Yan’s outer appearance that had changed. His aura had also reached the true peak of an advanced one star Dou Sheng. A little more and he would be able to breakthrough to the second star of the Dou Sheng class!</p>
 <p>Having his body tempered by the bloodline was really benefiting Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not wake from his state of slumber after his aura reached the peak of an advanced one star Dou Sheng…</p>
 <p>Time slowly flowed by as Xiao Yan remained in this state of slumber. Ninety-one days… ninety-three days… ninety-seven days... ninety-nine days…</p>
 <p>One hundred days!</p>
 <p>Time passed by one day at a time. The moment the hundredth day arrived, a strange rumbling sound suddenly appeared within the quiet room. This sound appeared like flowing water. If one’s eyes searched for the origin of the sound, one would surprisingly find that it was being emitted from Xiao Yan, who was seated on the cold jade bed!</p>
 <p>The space around Xiao Yan violently fluctuated after the rumbling sound appeared. Waves of substance-like energies began to agglomerate into many clusters of wind that lingered around Xiao Yan and emitted a howling sound.</p>
 <p>The spinning wind increased its rotating speed. In the end, an increasing amount of energy poured into the quiet room and was absorbed by the vortex. The size of this vortex rapidly swelled.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The hard quiet room was torn apart by that large wind at this moment. Glaring light shone in from outside.</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>The energy vortex that had suddenly appeared on the Eastern Dragon Island was immediately detected by many experts. Many figures rushed forward. They appeared outside of the quiet room where Xiao Yan was at within a couple of flashes. Their eyes were filled with shock as they watched the energy storm that was wildly spinning.</p>
 <p>“Do not panic. Everyone should return to their posts.”</p>
 <p>A faint voice was emitted from the dragon hall while everyone was feeling surprised. A couple of figures hurried over and appeared in the sky. Those figures were Zi Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor’s group.</p>
 <p>The members of the Ancient Void Dragon clan hurriedly bowed upon seeing Zi Yan. All of them began to slowly withdraw by some distance.</p>
 <p>“I was wondering why he needed such a long time to recuperate. He is actually intending to breakthrough…” Zi Yan floated in the sky. She looked down at Xiao Yan, who was within the vortex, and laughed.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor and Qing Lin by the side also quietly sighed in relief. They had been extremely worried in their hearts during these three months. If Zi Yan had not guaranteed that nothing would happen, they would not have been able to stop themselves from forcefully barging into the room. After all, the injuries that Xiao Yan had suffered this time around were too severe. Everyone had been worried that something untoward might have happened to him. Fortunately, the worst thing that they had imagined did not occur. On the other hand, Xiao Yan had ended up being blessed by this disaster. He had borrowed the bloodline strength within his body to make an attempt at reaching the second star of the Dou Sheng class!</p>
 <p>“Brother Xiao Yan is indeed an extraordinary person. He was merely an initial Dou Sheng a couple of months ago. Now, he is experiencing an opportunity to breakthrough to the second star…” Yao Ming by the side also let out heartfelt praise. Although he would occasionally return to the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe during this period of time, had had spent most of his time on the Eastern Dragon Island. It had been difficult for him to find an opportunity to grab onto a big support like the Ancient Void Dragon. Naturally, he would attempt to find as many opportunities as he could, especially now that the Eastern Dragon Island was showing signs of reunifying the Ancient Void Dragon tribe.</p>
 <p>While everyone in the sky was discussing Xiao Yan’s transformation, the energy that poured into the vortex from the surroundings became even more terrifying. In the end, the vortex even become viscous. Drops of energy could vaguely be seen floating around the vortex. They gradually emitted a frightening fluctuation that altered the expressions of others while the vortex rotated…</p>
 <p>As an increasing amount of energy gathered into energy droplets, the energy vortex appeared to turn into an energy whirlpool…</p>
 <p>Within a short few minutes, the final bit of energy also agglomerated into a droplet of liquid and merged with the enormous whirlpool.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The entire whirlpool began to violently tremble the moment the vortex transformed into a whirlpool. Soon after, Xiao Yan, who had descended into a hundred-day-slumber, suddenly opened both of his eyes. Two shocking purple-red lights shot out of them!</p>
 <p>The two purple-red lights shot toward the sky. Many of the members from the Ancient Dragon tribe on the Eastern Dragon Island felt a strange pressure from this purple-red light. The pressure originated from their bloodline….</p>
 <p>“This is… the pressure of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline? Why would it appear in his body?”</p>
 <p>The many members of the Ancient Dragon tribe were stunned because of this pressure Surprise flashed over Zi Yan’s face as she stood in the sky. She could sense a familiar feeling from within the light.</p>
 <p>“It is the Dragon Phoenix bloodline strength. Moreover, it is mixed with some other energy…”</p>
 <p>They were naturally unaware that Xiao Yan’s bloodline strength was the merger of the Xiao clan’s bloodline, the Gu clan’s bloodline, and the Dragon Phoenix’s bloodline. Thus, there would be a Dragon Phoenix scent to it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan widened his mouth abruptly while many exclamations sounded on the Eastern Dragon Island. Everyone quickly saw that enormous energy whirlpool turn into a water pillar that was devoured by Xiao Yan!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The cold jade bed that Xiao Yan had been sitting on blasted into pieces after the final drops of the energy liquid were sucked into Xiao Yan’s body. An unusually frightening aura slowly spread out of his body and covered the entire island…</p>
 <p>“Success…”</p>
 <p>Zi Yan’s group slowly sighed in relief within their hearts after sensing the frightening aura. Their eyes were filled with joy.</p>
 <p>“Hu…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan lifted his head and slowly exhaled a mouthful of viscous air. This air agglomerated together and turned into a drop of liquid that fell onto the cold jade dust below. A light flashed and those cold jade pieces of dust regathered into a stone platform. Moreover, there was an extremely shocking energy fluctuation being vaguely emitted from the platform.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stood up after letting out a long breath. He clenched his hand and an extremely powerful force spread from every cell within his body with lightning-like speed.</p>
 <p>“What a strong physical body…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan briefly sensed the condition of his body and a joy flashed across his eyes. After being tempered by his blood during these three months, the strength of his physical body would likely not be inferior to that of an Ancient Void Dragon.</p>
 <p>“I have really gained a blessing from disaster this time around…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand gently touched his chest. If he had not experienced a life and death battle this time around, the bloodline in his heart would not have activated, and he would have been unable to breakthrough to the second star of the Dou Sheng class with such speed. His physical body would also not have been strengthened to such an extent. Moreover, Xiao Yan sensed that there was still some tendrils of purple-red blood flowing out of his heart and refining his body despite him not being in a slumber. Although the effect was much weaker, it was superior in terms of its longevity. This continuous temperament would likely end up quite terrifying as it accumulated.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, brother Xiao Yan, congratulations. You have once again made a breakthrough after a short few months. This kind of training speed really causes me to feel ashamed…” A hearty laugh was transmitted from the sky while Xiao Yan was feeling slightly joyous about the changes in his body. Yao Ming’s group descended from the sky and landed a short distance from Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan cupped his hands to Yao Ming. After which, his eyes shifted to Zi Yan. His heart sighed in relief after seeing that she had recovered. It seemed that Zi Yan had also recovered from her weak state back then.</p>
 <p>“How long did this retreat of mine last?”</p>
 <p>“Over three months. It has just reached a hundred days.” The Little Fairy Doctor smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>“A hundred days, huh…” Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes upon hearing this news. He suddenly asked, “Has the alliance sent any news?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, some news was delivered a couple of days back. It was from Yao Lao. He requests that you hurry back to the Falling Star Pavilion as soon as possible.” The Little Fairy Doctor’s face revealed a grave expression. She looked at Xiao Yan and softly said, “The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is about to be born. It seems that the Hall of Souls has begun to act. Looks like they are planning to target the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly nodded. It was close to the time when the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame would be born. Xiao Yan was already aware that the Hall of Souls would be unwilling to simply remain quiet. They would definitely try to snatch a mysterious natural object like the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame…</p>
 <p>“Since this is the case, we will head back to the Falling Star Pavilion today. We also need to discuss the matters regarding the demon flame…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s voice was a little deep. He had put in a lot of effort for this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. He would need to put in more since he would have to deal with the experts from the Hun clan. He needed to obtain the demon flame regardless of what happens!</p>
