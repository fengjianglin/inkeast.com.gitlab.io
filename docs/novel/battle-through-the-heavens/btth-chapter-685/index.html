 <p><strong><u>Chapter 685: Start a Massacre</u></strong></p>
 <p>The rays of light flew across the sky and appeared in the sky above the capital a moment later.</p>
 <p>Over a dozen human figures were flapping the Dou Qi wings on their backs as they eventually sat and waited while surrounding Yun Du and the others in a semicircle shape in front of the dull gazes of the entire city. Their faces all contained some ridicule.</p>
 <p>The entire city once again became silent at the appearance of these ten plus human figures with wings extending from their backs. Countless numbers of people were stunned as they looked at the large Dou Wang unit that had suddenly appeared. Over ten expert Dou Wangs? This lineup… many people quietly inhaled a breath of cool air. Their heads began to feel giddy. There were at most only a couple of dozen expert Dou Wangs in the entire Jia Ma Empire. However, they were actually able to see so many of them today!</p>
 <p>The expressions of Yun Du’s group had turned pale-white at the appearance of these ten plus human figures. Their eyes were filled with shock and disbelief. Only at this moment did they truly feel a kind of terror. The current Xiao Yan already possessed a frightening strength that could shake the Misty Cloud Sect…</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan… are all these your people?” Hai Bodong was also shocked by the sudden appearance of such a huge lineup as he anxiously asked.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>Hai Bodong only sighed in relief upon seeing Xiao Yan nod his head. Joy immediately surged in his heart. He used his strength to pat Xiao Yan’s shoulders and smiled as he said, “Good fellow. You are indeed no longer that reckless little fellow back then. You actually know how to gather an army now.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed softly. He raised his eyes and looked at Yun Du’s group on the opposite side. A coldness surfaced in his dark-black eyes, “Ke ke, two Dou Huangs, seven Dou Wangs. Very good… it is really unexpected that the Misty Cloud Sect has served such a big gift the moment I return. Since that is the case, I shall unceremoniously receive it.”</p>
 <p>The expressions of Yun Du and the others became even uglier when they felt the dark, cold killing intent that seeped from Xiao Yan’s words. From the looks of the situation, it was likely that they would meet their end today. Although the Misty Cloud Sect was in close proximity to the capital, there was still a distance between the two of them. Even with their speed, they would require at least half an hour to hurry to the Misty Cloud Sect. This amount of time was already sufficient for this group of theirs to completely parish in this place.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, Xiao Yan, are these people the so-called members of the Misty Cloud Sect? This style is indeed extraordinary. Sending out seven Dou Wangs and two Dou Huangs when they act. This lineup could be considered quite a strong force even when placed in the ‘Black-Corner Region’.” Lin Yan’s gaze was filled with interest as he spoke to Xiao Yan with a bright laugh while looking at Yun Du’s group a short distance away.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and immediately waved his hand gently. His simple words containing dark, cold killing intent chilled a countless number of people.</p>
 <p>“Leave no one!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Lin Yan and the others nodded heavily after hearing Xiao Yan’s words. Immediately numerous powerful Dou Qis that were not weaker than the Misty Cloud Sect’s Dou Wangs erupted from their bodies. Finally, they flapped their wings and cut through the air, transforming into numerous blurry, black figures containing a sharp wind as they charged at the somewhat anxious Misty Cloud Sect’s expert.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, aren’t you afraid of being choked to death by trying to swallow us in one go!” Yun Du’s heart also pounded wildly when he saw the cold sternness of Xiao Yan as he waved his hand. Threads of wildness immediately surged onto Yun Du’s eyes as he furiously spoke.</p>
 <p>“All Misty Cloud Sect’s disciples, prepare for an all out fight! We will completely lay waste to the Primer clan even if we have to fight to our last man!”</p>
 <p>The Misty Cloud Sect’s disciples below who had paused because of the activity in the sky immediately emitted an orderly cry after hearing Yun Du’s furious roar. They once again waved their weapons and charged toward the interior of the Primer clan like a torrent. Under this wild attack by the Misty Cloud Sect, the defensive lines within the manor were swiftly torn apart!</p>
 <p>“Old Hai, I will leave those two Dou Huangs for you to handle. Leave the remaining Dou Wangs to the others!” Xiao Yan frowned slightly when he saw the swaying defensive line of the manor, which was about to fall apart. He turned his head toward Hai Bodong and spoke softly. Only Lin Yan and some expert Dou Wangs had appeared this time around. Xiao Yan did not allow Medusa, Old Yin Gu and the other expert who were of the Dou Huang class or stronger to appear at this moment. There was always a need to hold something back no matter what one did. Exposing all of one’s trump cards to the Misty Cloud Sect the moment he returned was an extremely foolish act. The current Xiao Yan would naturally not do this.</p>
 <p>“Aye, no problem!” Hai Bodong nodded without any hesitation when he heard this. Knowing that the situation was urgent, he did not say any unnecessary words. The ice wings on his back were flapped and he rushed out before charging into the chaotic battleground in the sky, completely blocking the two Dou Huangs Yun Du and Yun Sha.</p>
 <p>The dark-green flames on Xiao Yan’s back also moved a little after he saw this. After which, he rushed to the manor below.</p>
 <p>“Clan head, the Misty Cloud Sect is about to break into the inner yard. We are unable to defend any longer!”</p>
 <p>Anxious cries repeatedly spread from the chaotic manor while the sky descended into a big battle.</p>
 <p>“Everyone hold on, don’t engage in head on fights with them. Archers, prepare the ‘Qi Breaking Arrows’!” Ya Fei also hurriedly cried out as she looked at the swiftly broken defensive lines from the within the manor. Faced with the human-sea-like attack of the Misty Cloud Sect, even they…</p>
 <p>“Clan head, there are less than a hundred ‘Qi Breaking Arrows’ left!” A guard hurriedly said when he heard Ya Fei’s orders.</p>
 <p>“Use all of them!” Ya Fei’s eyebrows were vertical as she cried out loud. However, her cry had just sounded when a black figure abruptly flashed down from the sky.</p>
 <p>The black figure landed on the ground and the black-robed, young man carrying a heavy ruler smiled toward Ya Fei, revealing his white teeth. “Ya Fei jie, you have become even prettier than I last saw you three years ago…”</p>
 <p>TL; jie - older sister</p>
 <p>Ya Fei was somewhat absent-minded as she looked at the young face which had gained an additional maturity compared to three years ago. At this moment, it was as though the anxious cries that were repeatedly transmitted from her surroundings had disappeared. A sourness gradually surged onto Ya Fei’s nose and her eyes also became a sleek red. Her somewhat hoarse, yet moving voice was emitted from her red mouth, “You horrible brat, you are still willing to return?”</p>
 <p>“These three years, you have worked hard because of the Xiao clan…” Xiao Yan sighed as he looked at the mist forming in her alluring peach blossom eyes. He knew that the pressure Ya Fei carried during these few years was quite great. If not for Old Hai’s support, it was likely that she would be unable to endure on…</p>
 <p>The little grievances that Ya Fei originally felt in her heart instantly disappeared like a smoke when she heard this low voice that contained some apology. She cracked a smile that was so enchanting that it could enrapture an entire city…</p>
 <p>“That’s right… quickly come and see your older brother!” Ya Fei suddenly recovered and hurriedly moved her body aside. Behind her was a long-haired man who was seated on a wheelchair. His eyes, which were usually calm and indifferent, were filled with a gentle and faint excitement at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Big brother?” Xiao Yan was startled. His gaze hurriedly turned to the man who had half of his face covered by his long hair.</p>
 <p>“Xiao-yan-zi… you have finally returned. Ke ke, good little fellow. You didn’t disappoint big brother. You are the glory of the Xiao clan and father.” Gratification surfaced on the corner of Xiao Ding’s mouth as he spoke softly when he saw Xiao Yan, who appeared even more mature than he did three years ago.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quickly walked to Xiao Ding’s side. A wild joy surfaced on his face. However, when his gaze swept toward the wheelchair that Xiao Ding was sitting on, his eyes instantly narrowed and his body also swiftly became dark and cold, “Big brother, your leg?”</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, I’m fine. My leg is poisoned and has become completely crippled. Fortunately, there is nothing wrong with my head and hands.” Xiao Ding laughed as replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth tightly as he looked at the faint smile on Xiao Ding’s face. He could imagine just how difficult his big brother’s life was during these couple of years when he was protecting the remaining members of the Xiao clan…</p>
 <p>“Big brother, it has been hard on you these few years…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly knelt beside Xiao Ding. His eyes were completely red. The hoarse voice of his was finally unable to suppress the emotion in his heart.</p>
 <p>A large rough palm slowly rubbed Xiao Yan’s head. Xiao Ding smiled and slowly spoke with a warm voice, “Third brother, I am not the only one who has suffered. Don’t tell me that you have lived these three years well?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s sleeves wiped his eyes with all his strength. He raised his head and laughed, “It was alright. However, big brother will not need to suffer in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, I hope that is so. Alright, brat, just what do you look like crying in public. Moreover, now is not the time to reminisce about old times.” Xiao Ding patted Xiao Yan’s shoulders and reprimanded with a smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He stood up from the ground, turned his head, and softly spoke to a similarly red-eyed Ya Fei by the side, “Ya Fei jie, thank you very much. Leave the Misty Cloud Sect outside to me.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not wait for Ya Fei to reply after he said those words. His body flashed and appeared in the air above the manor.</p>
 <p>“Hey… be careful. There are too many of them.” Ya Fei hurriedly cried out when she saw Xiao Yan rushed into the air.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His gaze immediately turned toward the white-colored torrent outside. A cold, dark ruthlessness flashed across his eyes. With a wave of his hand, a cluster of dark-green flame surged onto his hand. Both of his hands pulled at the flame and the dark-green flame transformed into a cluster of green-colored flame and a cluster of invisible flame.</p>
 <p>With a flick of his finger, the green-colored flame shrank into Xiao Yan’s palm. That cluster of invisible flame, however, suddenly expanded greatly…</p>
 <p>“Ya Fei jie, tell the members of the Primer clan to withdraw… there is no longer a need for these defensive lines.” Ya Fei was startled when she heard the voice that was transmitted from the air. She did not hesitate as she waved her delicate hand. The members of the Primer clan who were defending the defensive line swiftly withdrew.</p>
 <p>With the withdrawal of the Primer clan members, the white-colored torrent immediately surged in and began occupying most of the manor from all directions.</p>
 <p>“Puff!”</p>
 <p>A slight puffing sound suddenly appeared just as the disciples of the Misty Cloud Sect wildly occupied the manor. Flames suddenly and strangely surged out of the body of a Misty Cloud Sect’s disciple who was at the front of the white torrent. Immediately, his entire person turned into a pile of ashes in the blink of an eye and burst apart.</p>
 <p>The strange fire that had suddenly appeared caused everyone to be startled. However, while everyone was still startled, numerous low, solemn explosive sounds repeatedly rang out!</p>
 <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>
 <p>Hence, the Misty Cloud Sect’s disciples, who had swarmed into the manor, were turned into burning people one after another in front of the countless number of shocked eyes belonging to the observers both in and outside of the manor. They finally burst apart in a strange manner. None of them emitted a miserable cry because of their imminent death from the beginning until the end. The entire place only had the soft muffled sound that was emitted from the bursting apart of flesh…</p>
 <p>At this moment, an unusual cold darkness lingered in the hearts of a countless number of people…</p>
