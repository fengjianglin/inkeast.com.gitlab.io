 <p><strong><u>Chapter 985: Chased With Killing Intent</u></strong></p>
 <p>A ray of light rushed outside Bone Transforming City in a lightning-like manner. In the blink of an eye, it charged into the mountain range that was outside of the city.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan activated his bone wings to their maximum strength, raising his speed to a frightening extent. His expression was a little gloomy as his figure rushed forward. Although he did not sense Fei Tian giving chase, he did not think that young-looking old fellow would give up so easily.</p>
 <p>“Just how did this old fellow find me? I have been traveling through the deep mountains and old forests during this period of time. It is impossible for the people from the Wind Lightning Pavilion to discover me.”</p>
 <p>Some doubt appeared in Xiao Yan’s heart as his figure flashed. The northern region of the Central Plains was so large. Regardless of how capable Fei Tian was, it was impossible for this person to find him in a sea of people without reason. Moreover, looking at his manner earlier, it was clear that this person was already aware of his position. Could he have been discovered by the spies from the Wind Lightning Pavilion when he had entered the city yesterday? Even if that was the case, this place was already beyond the territory of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. It was impossible for a spy from the Wind Lightning Pavilion to pass the information back to the Wind Lightning Pavilion within a day even if that spy had discovered him..</p>
 <p>Doubt appeared in Xiao Yan’s heart. He involuntarily felt a sense of danger. That fellow might appear like a light breeze, but he actually gave Xiao Yan a dangerous feeling. This kind of feeling was something that Xiao Yan had seldom sensed on anyone except the unfathomable Qian Bai Elders and the Old Ground Demon Ghost.</p>
 <p>“This old fellow’s strength is at least that of an eight star Dou Zong. Even if I used Tian Huo zun-zhe’s strength it would be difficult for me to face him head-on unless I used the Extermination Fire Lotus, but that is ultimately my life preservation skill. Unless it is absolutely necessary, it is best not to use it…”</p>
 <p>These thoughts flew swiftly across Xiao Yan’s heart. However, his speed was not the least bit reduced. His body was just like a meteorite that disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>“That old fellow… has really given up chasing after me?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan flew wildly for nearly ten plus minutes. His eyebrows were knit even more tightly when he saw that no one had given chase. Finally, he muttered in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>“The old me said that you won’t be able to escape…”</p>
 <p>A faint laugh was suddenly transmitted from a distance while Xiao Yan was softly muttering to himself. His body stiffened. Immediately, his eyes shrank and locked onto a mountain peak in front of him. The silver-robed Fei Tian was standing their with his hands behind his back. His silver-white eyes were mocking Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“This old fellow’s speed is really frightening…” Xiao Yan inhaled a breath of cool air. His expression had become solemn. It seemed that there would likely be some trouble today.</p>
 <p>“You might possess the Three Thousand Lightning Movement and those mysterious bone wings. However, you have chosen the wrong target if you wish to compete with the old me in terms of speed.” Fei Tian smiled as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Just what are you planning to do?” Xiao Yan cried out in a deep voice. His eyes swept all around him without leaving a trace, searching for a route to flee.</p>
 <p>“Hand over the Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body to the old me. You might have gathered the four scrolls, but it is still impossible for you to practice it. Hence, it is a waste leaving them on you.” Fei Tian spoke in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“You will allow me to leave if I return the Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body to you?” Xiao Yan’s eyes narrowed as he slowly asked.</p>
 <p>Fei Tian merely smiled when he heard this. He gently stepped forward and his body appeared a hundred meters away from Xiao Yan in a strange manner. He laughed, “The old me is also interested in your Qi Method that can merge ‘Heavenly Flames.’ I might let you go if you hand it over to me.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression had completely turned gloomy when he heard these words. Flame Mantra was his greatest support. The reason he had been able to reach this level today was largely because of Flame Mantra. If this fellow wanted to snatch Flame Mantra from him, it was little different than taking his life away. Moreover, it was impossible for Xiao Yan to hand over such a mysterious Qi Method like the Flame Mantra to an outsider, and the Wind Lightning Pavilion could be considered his enemy.</p>
 <p>“The old me knows that you possess an extremely powerful spiritual body in your body. I am able to vaguely sense its existence. However, a spiritual body is ultimately just a spiritual body. If he had been more than a spiritual body, the old me would likely have to withdraw today. Unfortunately…” Fei Tian was unconcerned when he saw Xiao Yan’s gloomy expression. His gaze slowly drifted over Xiao Yan’s body before finally pausing on the snow-white Storage Ring on his finger. He laughed in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, what arrogant words. If the old me was in an actual body, would he dare to stand in front of me now?” The snow-white ring trembled slightly and Tian Huo zun-zhe’s spirit slowly rose. He looked at Fei Tian across from him and coldly laughed.</p>
 <p>Fei Tian’s expression changed a little. His gaze slowly swept over Tian Huo zun-zhe. This person was already able to reach such a level by just being a spiritual body. This person was definitely a Dou Zun class ultimate expert when he was alive.</p>
 <p>“A hero doesn’t mention his old achievements. There is no ‘if’ when it comes to the matters of this world. Regardless of how great you were when you were alive, the current you is merely a spiritual body…” A gradual coldness also surfaced in Fei Tian’s indifferent voice. “Xiao Yan, as long as you hand over the Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body and the Qi Method you practice, the old me shall allow you to leave. This spiritual body cannot protect your life!”</p>
 <p>“A mere eight star Dou Zong also dares to act so arrogant in front of the old me…” Tian Huo zun-zhe angrily laughed. He turned his head to Xiao Yan and softly said, “Leave first. I will block him.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard these words. Although he really disliked that old demon Fei Tian, he knew that what he had said was true. The current Tian Huo zun-zhe at the very most had a strength similar to Fei Tian. Moreover, he was at a disadvantage since he was a spiritual body. If they were to fight, Tian Huo zun-zhe’s chances of victory were very slim.</p>
 <p>“Relax, I know my limits. I will only block him for awhile. There is no need for you to worry. That ring of mine has my spiritual imprint. I have my own method of shaking him off.” Tian Huo zun-zhe continued, aware of the worry in Xiao Yan’s heart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment when he heard him. He soon violently nodded. He was indeed of little help by remaining here. He ceased hesitating, opened his bone wings, and flapped with all his might, transforming into a ray of light that wildly rushed in another direction.</p>
 <p>Fei Tian knit his brows slightly when he saw Xiao Yan flee. His feet stepped forward and was just about to give chase when he realized that the surrounding space had actually become distorted.</p>
 <p>“It has been many years since I have fought with someone. Allow me to test your skills today!”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe somewhat illusionary figure slowly appeared in front of Fei Tian. He clenched his hand and a longsword that was agglomerated from Spiritual Strength appeared.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of how you block me, he will ultimately be unable to escape my palm…”</p>
 <p>Fei Tian coldly laughed. His body shook and a bright lightning glow surged of him in a cackling manner. Following the appearance of the lightning glow, the clouds in the sky above gradually became dark. Silver serpent-like lightning was vaguely shuttling within it. This old demon had actually reached the stage where he could use his own Dou Qi to communicate with natural energy…</p>
 <p>Fei Tian’s hand reached forward. A lightning glow flashed and a long spear that was agglomerated from lightning appeared with a ‘chi chi’ sound. The body of the spear shook along with space itself.</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe was not afraid despite seeing this strong skill of Fei Tian. He let out a loud laugh as his majestic Spiritual Strength swept out. His body moved and the spiritual longsword pierced forward while forming numerous spiritual ripples.</p>
 <p>Fei Tian laughed in the face of Tian Huo zun-zhe’s attack. The lightning spear in his hand carried an incomparable lightning Dou Qi which emitted a repeated ‘chi chi’ sound. Finally, it was violently swung out.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The clear sound of a collision resounded across the entire sky. In the face of this strange sonic wave, some of the weaker Magical Beast in the mountain range below felt a crack in their head before bursting apart.</p>
 <p>The strength that was exchanged between the two was actually this terrifying!</p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure was rushing forward like a ray of light. He had also sensed a little of the change in the sky far behind him. However, he did not turn around. Tian Huo zun-zhe had put in a great amount of effort to buy him some time. Turning around would be the most foolish decision.</p>
 <p>“Old bastard, I shall remember today’s grudge. I will definitely repay you in the future!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth. His expression was a little ferocious. That old fellow had actually targeted the Flame Mantra. This had completely infuriated Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Killing intent churned in Xiao Yan’s heart. However, his speed was not reduced by even a little. With a ‘swoosh’ sound, the light ray flew across the sky, instantly disappearing on the edge of the mountain range.</p>
 <p>This all out flying continued for nearly twenty minutes or so when the space in front of Xiao Yan became distorted. Immediately, a Spiritual Strength came out of the space. It was surprisingly Tian Huo zun-zhe, who had stayed behind to block Fei Tian earlier. At this moment, Tian Huo zun-zhe’s expression was a little solemn. His figure also seemed paler than it had been earlier. From the looks of it, he had experienced a violent fight with that old demon Fei Tian during these twenty minutes.</p>
 <p>“Leave quickly, teleportation through space is something that only an elite Dou Zun can do. If I had not reached the Dou Zun level and am currently a spiritual body, it is likely that I would have difficulty using it. However, that fellow’s speed is extremely frightening. It is likely that he will catch up within a short while.” Tian Huo zun-zhe urged in an anxious voice the moment he appeared.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. He was just about to move when a thought suddenly flashed through his heart. He spoke in a solemn voice, “Something’s wrong… I have a feeling that the old fellow has locked onto my location… I think that it is likely that I am in possession of something that is directing him to our location…”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Tian Huo zun-zhe also nodded while deeply thinking. No wonder that fellow dared to say that Xiao Yan would not be able to escape him.</p>
 <p>“I am certain that my body doesn’t have any tracking seal. Yet, he is still aware of my location… in other words, it is something else…”</p>
 <p>A flicker flashed swiftly in Xiao Yan’s eyes. Soon after, he waved his hand and the four silver-colored scrolls appeared in his hand. His gaze stared intently at the scrolls before gritting his teeth and tossing them violently. The four scrolls immediately shot out in four different directions, transforming into four silver lights as they did so.</p>
 <p>“Old bastard, I want to see just how you will give chase now!”</p>
