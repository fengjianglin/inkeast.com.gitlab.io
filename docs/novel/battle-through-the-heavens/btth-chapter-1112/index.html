 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1112: Resolving the Demon Poison Spot</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body was stiff for an instant before it was enveloped by an even denser, more lustful flame. He took the opportunity presented by Xun Er’s stiff body to force his tongue in. He was just like a bandit that was plundering wantonly.</p>
 <p>Xun Er was similarly shocked by Xiao Yan’s boldness until her mind became much blurrier. Only after Xiao Yan had barged in did she reflexively began to struggle. However, the current her appeared exceptionally weak. Her frightening strength, where her punch could penetrate space itself, seemed to have completely disappeared at this moment.</p>
 <p>The lustful flame burned within Xiao Yan’s chest. His roaming hand around Xun Er’s waist involuntarily climbed. A moment later, it finally touched a softness that caused one to brace one’s attention…</p>
 <p>The soft touch was just like a spark that lit the fuse of some explosive. Xiao Yan’s hand quietly undid her green clothes, revealing her snow-like skin.</p>
 <p>“*Cough*... young miss, the old me has something to discuss with you.”</p>
 <p>A dry elderly cough suddenly sounded outside of the door just when Xiao Yan was about to gradually peel everything off of the person in his embrace. The elderly voice was clearly transmitted into the room.</p>
 <p>This elderly voice contained a powerful Dou Qi that seemed to explode beside Xiao Yan’s and Xun Er’s ears, suddenly waking the both of them from a state of being lost in passion.</p>
 <p>After recovering her clear head, Xun Er saw the extremely intimate posture of the two of them and the clothes that had already been half stripped from her, revealing her snow-white skin underneath. Her face immediately turned so red that it appeared as though blood was about to drip from it. A pair of dark eyes stared angrily at Xiao Yan in her embarrassment. She extended her hand and pulled the blanket over, wrapping it tightly around her body as she did so.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also recovered his mind at this moment. He helplessly spread his hands as he looked at Xun Er’s embarrassed anger. After which, he awkwardly said, “That… it is not my fault… ugh, no… ugh…” Xiao Yan tried to defend himself before eventually lowering his head, dispirited. He did not expect his self control to be this poor in front of Xun Er.</p>
 <p>Xun Er’s lovely and enchanting face involuntarily revealed a smile when she saw the dispirited Xiao Yan lowering his head. However, this smile was quickly withdrawn by her. Her body hid under the blanket as she hurriedly put on her clothes amid a trudging sound. After which, she softly said, “You rascal, you are actually having such crooked thoughts…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan raised his head. He moved his lips and muttered with a helpless face, “What can I do against Xun Er’s allure, but a moment ago…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t say it!”</p>
 <p>Xun Er’s face once again turned red. She hurriedly extended her hand and blocked Xiao Yan’s mouth. However, he ended up grabbing her hand instead. She thought that Xiao Yan was about to do something bad again when she saw a love that could not be hidden in his dark-black eyes.</p>
 <p>The bright redness on Xun Er’s face became much paler under Xiao Yan’s eyes. She bit her lower red lip with the back of her teeth as hesitation flashed across her eyes. Immediately, she abruptly lowered her head and gave Xiao Yan’s face a superficial peck.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan ge-ge, the bloodline in Xun Er’s body has yet completely awaken. I cannot perform any intercourse. Otherwise, the consequences would be very serious. Wait until we meet again… alright?”</p>
 <p>Surprise immediately flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes when he heard the soft mosquito-like voice that sounded beside him. He turned his head, only to see the usually crystal-clear earlobes of the girl had turned a fiery-red in color…</p>
 <p>Xun Er felt her head explode when she spoke. Even she could not imagine that she would utter those words. Immediately, she ceased saying anything else to Xiao Yan. Her body moved and she rushed out of the room.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently clenched his hand as he studied Xun Er’s figure. The creaminess from earlier seemed to have remained…</p>
 <p>“This old fellow interrupted something good. How inconsiderate…”</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan was quietly muttering under his breath, the two black-clothed, old men outside the room were walking up and down just like ants in a hot pot. Their eyes appeared a little red. They had been protecting Xun Er all this while and had naturally discovered that she had suddenly come to Xiao Yan’s room earlier. They did not think much of it, but following the flow of time, they seemed to have sensed something amiss. Xiao Yan and Xun Er were both young. Now that they had reunited, they were just like dry wood and a strong flame, igniting upon contact…</p>
 <p>If they were an ordinary man and woman, it was fine if they ignited. The two of them would definitely not do something this inconsiderate. However, Xun Er was not an ordinary lady. She was the person with the most perfect bloodline in the Gu clan within the last thousand years. If she were to hand her body to Xiao Yan today, Xiao Yan would definitely be chased to the ends of the world by the furious Gu clan. At that time, the two of them would also face the offense of not properly protecting Xun Er. Their fates would not be any better than Xiao Yan’s fate. All of this was because Xun Er was really too important to the Gu clan!</p>
 <p>The two of them continued walking back and forth in front of the entrance. A moment later, they suddenly came to a halt. Their eyes looked at each other and saw the red eyes of the other party. Finally, they nodded. They suddenly turned their bodies and forcefully pushed the door.</p>
 <p>“Creak…”</p>
 <p>Their hands were about to make contact with the door when the door was suddenly opened. Xun Er’s figure appeared in front of the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Young miss!”</p>
 <p>The two black-clothed, old men were a little agitated when they saw Xun Er coming out. Their old eyes contained an impulse to cry. If this young man and woman were a little impulsive, it was likely that the entire Gu clan would become crazy…</p>
 <p>Seeing the appearance of these two, Xun Er’s face, forcefully maintaining a cold and indifferent look, involuntarily reddened a little. However, her voice appeared exceptionally calm, “Old Lin, what are the both of you doing?”</p>
 <p>The corner of the white-haired, old man’s mouth slightly twitched. He immediately asked with a faltering voice. “Young miss, you and Xiao Yan didn’t do anything, right?”</p>
 <p>“What nonsense are the both of you thinking!”</p>
 <p>A bright redness once again surged onto Xun Er’s face after being asked so directly. She viciously stared at the two of them while feeling some guilt. After which, she pushed the two of them aside and hurried back to her room.</p>
 <p>The two black-clothed, old man finally sighed in relief after hearing her words.</p>
 <p>“There doesn’t seem to be any change in young miss’s aura, it is likely that she did not do that…” The white-clothed, old man observed Xun Er in the distance. He rubbed the cold sweat off his forehead and spoke.</p>
 <p>“That is because the both of us had come in time. Given young miss’ character, would her ears have become so red if nothing had happened? Fortunately, they did not reach that stage.” The black-clothed, old man rubbed his heart, which had been beating like a drum, while bitterly laughing.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, fortunately… if it really reached that point, the both of us would be sinners of the Gu clan…” The white-haired, old man sighed.</p>
 <p>Even with the calmness of the black-clothed elders, some palpitations involuntarily surged into their hearts when they thought of the importance of Xun Er to the Gu clan. They immediately glanced at Xiao Yan’s room with vicious looks. After which, both of their bodies moved and they slowly disappeared from in front of the room. What occurred tonight was likely the most alarming experience of their lives…</p>
 <p>Within the room, Xiao Yan hugged the blanket that had been wrapped around Xun Er earlier. He was lost for a moment. After which, he bitterly smiled and set it down. He was a little reckless during the event that had occurred tonight. After hearing what Xun Er had said, it was clear that she could not perform any intercourse at this moment. If the two Gu clan elders had not said anything earlier, it was likely that he would have ended up making a big mistake tonight…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly sighed and inhaled a deep breath of air, gradually calming his mind in the process.</p>
 <p>After gradually calming his mind, the golden-colored scroll that Xun Er had given him appeared in his hand. Inside it was the last three seals of the God Seal Skill. Xiao Yan was extremely interested in this God Seal Skill. Based on what was recorded on it, if he mastered all five seals, its strength would be comparable to that of a Tian class Dou Technique!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was unclear about the might of a Tian class Dou Technique. However, he was able to obtain some clues from the Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique. With the help of this Dou Technique, he had used his own strength to defeat Tian She and Bing Xuan, the expert trio from the Ice River Valley. The result of the battle was indeed glorious.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan held the golden-colored scroll and played with it a little. After musing, he did not immediately begin to practice it. Instead, he returned it to his Storage Ring. After his conversation with Xun Er, Xiao Yan had gained a more complete understanding of the importance of strength.</p>
 <p>“A Dou Technique can be practiced any time. Raising my strength is the most important thing!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression gradually turned grave. His hand suddenly pulled apart his clothes, revealing the black-colored vortex of the Demon Poison Spot. In the past, he had been afraid that the swift increase in his strength would result in his foundation being unstable. However, after using the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, Xiao Yan gained some control of the strength of energy on higher levels. Hence, it was time to completely resolve this Demon Poison Spot!</p>
 <p>With Xiao Yan’s current strength, it was no longer difficult for him to completely refine the Demon Poison Spot. With the capacity of Xiao Yan’s body, it should be possible for it to completely absorb the enormous amount of pure Dou Qi contained within it. In other words, resolving this Demon Poison Spot that had troubled Xiao Yan for many years was a matter of course!</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, Xie Bi Yan, I shall now unceremoniously accept the great gift you gave me back then!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand gently rubbed the Demon Poison Spot on his chest. A cold smile surfaced on the corner of his mouth. He swiftly crossed his legs and sat down. With a change of the seal formed by his hands, the jade-green flame within his body furiously began to burn. After which, it wildly charged to the location of the Demon Poison Spot!</p>
 <p>The interior of the Demon Poison Spot contained all of the Dou Qi of Xie Bi Yan. Back then, Xie Bi Yan had been a two to three star Dou Zong no matter how one put it. Although the current Demon Poison Spot was no longer complete, Xiao Yan’s strength would definitely soar if he could successfully refine all of it!</p>
 <p>This situation was something that Xiao Yan was happy to see. The current him needed sufficient strength!</p>
 <p>Without strength, everything was just unrealistic plans and empty talk!</p>
