 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1506: Breaking the Illusion</u></strong></p>
 <p>The smile on the white-robed man’s handsome face slowly disappeared. A strange icy chill replaced it. Both of his eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan, but he did not speak. The surrounding space trembled like a wave of water.</p>
 <p>“Illusion?”</p>
 <p>Xun Er and the rest were startled upon hearing Xiao Yan’s words. They seemed to have come to an understanding. “Are you saying that we are still in an illusion?”</p>
 <p>“I am real!” Zi Yan hurriedly proclaimed. Based on her senses, she was definitely real and did not exist in an illusion!</p>
 <p>“We are all real…” Xiao Yan’s eyes stared at the white-robed man as he softly said, “However, we have all stepped into an illusion. This is the most terrifying aspect of the Nightmare Heaven Fog. If we continue to progress as the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had planned, we would only sink further and further into it. In the end, we would have become its fire slaves. Even though we experience a big battle and win, we will still remain in an illusion…”</p>
 <p>“You mean that those fire slaves we have met, including Xiao Chen… are all an illusion?” Gu Nanhai frowned. He suddenly looked at the silent Xiao Chen and asked a question.</p>
 <p>“There is reality in fake and fake in reality. This is why the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is most terrifying. Ancestor Xiao Chen is not an illusion. He is real.” Xiao Yan shook his head. He glanced at Xiao Chen and softly said, “However, most of his consciousness was controlled by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame…”</p>
 <p>Xun Er and the others looked at each other. After which, their eyes cautiously swept around them, but they were unable to sense even the slightest fluctuation from an illusion regardless of how carefully the looked.</p>
 <p>“Back then, the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was known as a peak expert who was closest to the Dou Di class, but he eventually suffered a backlash from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, which resulted in his death… the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had obtained his inheritance after his death. The Nightmare Heaven Fog was a Dou Skill that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was renowned for. When the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint unleashed this skill, he was able to get millions of people in an entire city to live in an illusion for centuries. The magical effect of this illusion is not something that an ordinary person can comprehend.” Xiao Yan softly sighed. His voice also contained some surprise. This illusion was absolutely terrifying even if one simply thought about it. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was indeed worthy of the title demonic saint.</p>
 <p>“The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame did not possess such an ability in the past…” Gu Nanhai spoke in a deep voice. No one had met such a troublesome problem the last few times the demonic flame had appeared.</p>
 <p>“A thousand years can change many things. It can give the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame enough time to gradually learn all the tricks of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. From a certain point of view, its current self could be described as another ‘Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint’...” Xiao Yan softly explained. His eyes stared at the white-robed man, whose expression had become even colder.</p>
 <p>“Why is it that you have such a great understanding of the Nightmare Heavenly Fog?” The white-robed man on the throne finally asked a question in a somewhat dense voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. His hand rubbed his forehead without being obvious, but he did not reply to the question. The reason that he had been able to come to a sudden understanding and had been able to detect the strangeness of the situation was naturally because of a clue given to him by the light cluster in his mind. If not for the light cluster, even Xiao Yan would have ended up dying in this place. Before the reminder of that mysterious light cluster, he had never even thought that they were still be in an illusion even after escaping the Nightmare Heaven Fog.</p>
 <p>“Looks like you have been creating this illusion for one thousand years. Of course, if nothing unexpected happened, you would have gained a huge victory this time around. I’m afraid that no one would have been able to discover a clue about this place…” Xiao Yan slightly smiled. His heart was filled with relief. This place had been built by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame for a thousand years. It would not be broken so easily. If he had not obtained that mysterious light cluster from the ancient map, those who entered the demonic flame realm this time around would have been completely eradicated. Even those from the Hall of Souls would not be an exception!</p>
 <p>“But it is unfortunate…”</p>
 <p>The white-robed man’s eyes were cold and indifferent as they stared at Xiao Yan. Strands of cream-white flames slowly spread from his body. An annihilation temperature gradually covered this area.</p>
 <p>The expression of Xun Er’s group changed after seeing the white-clothed man prepare. They hurriedly clustered together while revealing a cautious expression in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Since this is an illusion, how should we break it? The feeling that this fellow gives us is extremely real.” Yao Lao softly spoke. He was gradually beginning to trust what Xiao Yan was saying. They had already fallen into an illusion, but the white-robed human figure with a flame around him told them that they would still end up dead if they were killed in this place.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of how it appears to be real, an illusion is ultimately an illusion. As long as your hearts feel that he is extremely strong, he will never be defeated. His strength in this place is determined by the thoughts in our hearts.” Xiao Yan softly explained.</p>
 <p>“You are seeking death!”</p>
 <p>The handsome face of the white-robed man finally changed after Xiao Yan’s words sounded. He let out a furious cry as he moved his body. After which, he appeared above Xiao Yan’s head. He clenched his hand, and a cream-white flame transformed into a long fire spear. He swung his arm, and the long spear tore through space itself. It was accompanied by a destructive feeling as it ruthlessly shot toward Xiao Yan’s group.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s expression became slightly pale when they sensed this destructive force.</p>
 <p>“Do not unleash any Dou Qi defenses. Just treat him like a completely useless dog in your hearts. Otherwise, all of us will die!” After seeing this attack, Xiao Yan's voice appeared like thunder as he suddenly cried out.</p>
 <p>The thunderous roar that echoed beside his ear also blasted everyone’s hearts until they tremble. They could not even spend the time to think about Xiao Yan’s extremely funny comparison as they hurriedly suppressed the fear in their hearts. After which, they stiffened their bodies and withdrew all of their Dou Qi. All they could do was put their trust in Xiao Yan at this moment…</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The enormous fire spear descended from the sky. It was accompanied by a destructive force that ruthlessly surrounded their bodies. However, that fire long spear suddenly disappeared just when they thought their bodies were about to suffer a serious blow!</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>A furious expression appeared on the handsome face of that white-robed man who was floating in the sky. His body began to reveal signs of being an illusion at this moment. He had not expected Xiao Yan to find a method to weaken his strength with such great speed.</p>
 <p>“Nightmare Illusion, break!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was grave. He pressed down with his finger as a drop of essence blood shot out of his hand. The essence blood swiftly moved on his finger and formed a strange blood symbol.</p>
 <p>“Breaking Nightmare Seal? How do you know about this?”</p>
 <p>The white-robed man’s expression quickly turned gloomy after seeing that blood symbol.</p>
 <p>“Go!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan completely ignored him. He pressed down with his finger and the blood symbol shot out. After which, it ruthlessly adhered to the empty space in front of him before the entire space began to tremble. Finally, it emitted a ‘bang’ in front of Xiao Yan’s group’s joyous eyes and exploded apart!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group suddenly sensed a giddiness in their minds the moment the space exploded. They hurriedly opened their eyes.</p>
 <p>A sea of magma appeared in their eyes after they opened them. Occasionally a cream-colored flame would be emitted from the magma. This cream-colored magma continued to extend to the horizon. It seemed that this entire realm was just a sea of magma.</p>
 <p>There were some large mountain rocks floating in the air above the sea of magma. Xiao Yan’s group was on one of these mountain rocks. An enormous silver light circle was slowly rotating a short distance behind them…</p>
 <p>“Have we come out?”</p>
 <p>Xun Er’s group sighed in relief after seeing this foreign place.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me that this is still an illusion?” Yao Lao looked around him and questioned in a somewhat frightened voice. They were really afraid after what had happened earlier. None of them could have imagined that all their hard work over such a long time was all for naught.</p>
 <p>“The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame does not have such an ability…” Xiao Yan smiled. His heart sighed in relief after having been relieved of a great burden. It seemed as though his soul had become a lot lighter after having escaped from that damn illusion. The Nightmare Heaven Fog was indeed worthy of being a Dou Skill that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was renowned for. It was really too frightening.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Chen by the side once again emitted a low roar while Xiao Yan was sighing in relief. A struggling expression surfaced on his face as he informed everyone in a hurried hoarse voice, “The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is trying to control me again!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression changed slightly upon hearing this. Although Xiao Chen was considered a fire slave of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, he was able to rely on his strength strength to resist the control of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. If it was possible to find a method to remove the control of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, he would definitely be a great help. Xiao Yan was lacking such a peak expert, who could hold his own weight.</p>
 <p>Thinking about it was one thing while doing it was another. Xiao Yan had already experienced just how frightening the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame could be. How could it be so easy to destroy its control over Xiao Chen?</p>
 <p>The mysterious light cluster in Xiao Yan’s head suddenly emitted a slight fluctuation while he was thinking of a way to help.</p>
 <p>“This is…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was slightly startled after sensing this fluctuation. He sensed his surroundings before his face revealed joy. His hand suddenly pressed against Xiao Chen’s forehead. A Spiritual Strength surged out and swiftly drew an invisible symbol on Xiao Chen’s forehead. Following the formation of this symbol, the struggle on Xiao Chen’s face began to weaken.</p>
 <p>“This can only temporarily isolate the control of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. In order to completely remove it, we must finish off the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan withdrew his hand and softly spoke after seeing Xiao Chen returning to normal.</p>
 <p>“Swoosh swoosh!”</p>
 <p>Many figures began to suddenly appear on those floating mountain rocks after Xiao Yan’s words sounded. They floated in the sky and continued to pant. A horror covered their faces.</p>
 <p>“Looks like your act of tearing apart the illusion has created a domino effect and gotten all of these people out…” Yao Lao spoke after seeing these individuals.</p>
 <p>“It is just as well that they have come out. With our strength alone, we are unable to finish off the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame…” Xiao Yan slightly smiled. His eyes were thrown to the sea of magma a short distance away. The magma was slowly rising at that spot. A thousand-foot-large magma pillar rose from the sea of magma. It slowly came to a halt after reaching the same height as everyone else. It writhed and a white-robed handsome man appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>The expressions of Xiao Yan’s group became grave after observing this life-like figure. This current person was the true Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame…</p>
