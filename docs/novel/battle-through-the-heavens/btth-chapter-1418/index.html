 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1418: Breakthrough!</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Swoosh!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group rushed through the air. Hun Yu’s group was a couple thousand feet in front of them. They had not exhausted much Dou Qi with their powerful strength. While the others became crazy after being pushed into the ferocious beasts, they had rested. Thus, they were prepared to break through.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over Hun Yu’s group in front. After which, he glanced behind him. The group from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe was a short distance behind. The man with the colorful pupils, called Jiu Feng, was leading them. The many Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe experts were guarding something behind him. Xiao Yan caught sight of Feng Qing Er in this group. At this moment, she had woken up. Although a red handprint remained on her face, she, at the very least, had retained her life.</p>
 <p>Feng Qing Er lifted her head while Xiao Yan was observing the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe’s group. Her eyes clashed with Xiao Yan’s eyes as she grit her silver teeth. However, she held back this time around and did not dare to express the hatred in her heart. Xiao Yan’s slap earlier had woken her up.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was unconcerned about Feng Qing Er. Although her strength had soared, her future achievement was limited and would not pose much of a threat.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. After which, he looked further behind where a couple of groups were following them. These people possessed quite a great strength. From the looks of it, they understood the beast tide here relatively well. Hence, they had retained most of their strength and did not exhaust a large amount of Dou Qi when they charged in earlier.</p>
 <p>“We are still in the beast tide. I wonder if there will be even stronger ferocious beast near the back…” Xiao Yan lifted his head. The scarlet-red beasts seemed to have become sparser near the distant horizon. That place was likely the end of the beast tide. However, no one knew if there would be some extremely-difficult-to-deal-with ferocious beasts there. Although many ferocious beasts had appeared during this journey, the strongest one that Xiao Yan had met was only equivalent to a five star Dou Zun. He had not met any stronger ones.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>Many furious roars filled with violence once again rang out while Xiao Yan was in deep thought. He then vaguely sensed an additional pressure form around them.</p>
 <p>“Have those people behind been finished off…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was quiet. There had been dozens of elite Dou Zuns in that group. However, these numbers were not worth mentioning to this beast tide. Even though their resistance was extremely intense, it futile—death was only a matter of time. The thing that caused Xiao Yan’s heart to sink a little was that even with so many people, they were only able to endure for a short period of time…</p>
 <p>“Everyone, be careful. Maintain the formation from earlier. Brother Qing Yang, the both of us will open a path up front!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently exhaled. He leaped forward and appeared at the front of the group. He issued orders in a deep voice. Once those ferocious beasts’ attention shifted away from those people behind, the pressure they would face would abruptly soar. Hence, they needed to begin to increase their advancement speed.</p>
 <p>“Understood.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yang also understood their current situation. He nodded and moved, appearing beside Xiao Yan as he did. The remaining people formed a triangular shape. The weakest were placed in the middle. The remaining people would take turns to fight. This tactic would enable them to sustain their advancement for a prolonged period of time.</p>
 <p>“The beast tide has arrived. Charge!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes swept around. All he saw was scarlet eyes, and all he heard was a heavy panting. A cold cry appeared as his speed suddenly increased. A hot Heavenly Flame surged out of his body and turned into a thousand-foot-large fire dragon that gave off a dragon roar. The fire dragon’s large tail was violently swung while its body forcefully killed hundreds of ferocious beasts with earth-shaking steps.</p>
 <p>“Sea Flipping Seal!”</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yang unleashed hundreds of handprints when Xiao Yan attacked. His handprints whistled out and cleared the surrounding beasts.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Xun Er, Cai Lin, Yun Yun, the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest behind attacked. Vast and mighty Dou Qi spread apart as the ferocious beasts within a hundred meter radius were completely eliminated.</p>
 <p>Their speed was not reduced while they attacked. Within the blink of an eye, they had charged a thousand feet forward. Their strength could be considered quite powerful. If they joined hands, they would be able to successfully charge across the plains if they did not meet any overly powerful ferocious beasts, but unleashing this Heavenly Flame form was extremely exhausting.</p>
 <p>However, this exhaustion did not pose much of a problem to Xiao Yan, who possessed many Dou Qi recovery medicinal pills.</p>
 <p>“Those fellows are really quick.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at Hun Yu while he maintained his speed. Hun Yu’s group had finally unleashed their true strength at this moment. Not a single ferocious beast could charge into a thousand-foot-radius of them. Frightening Dou Qi saturated the air around them like a chaotic wave, wildly killing any ferocious beasts that charged at them.</p>
 <p>“How much longer?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan controlled the fire dragon above his head. It whistled out and cleared away the ferocious beasts in front of his group. His mouth let out an inquiry in a deep voice at the same time. Although they could endure on, this continuous exhaustion was clearly not a solution.</p>
 <p>“We have already reached the deepest parts of the beast tide. Based on this speed, we will be able to successfully breakthrough in half an hour. Of course, the precondition is that we do not meet any troublesome beasts. Even we have never charged this far before until. All we can do is to rely on the information obtained from the clan and make a guess.” Xun Er quickly replied.</p>
 <p>“Half an hour…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knit his brow when he heard how much longer it would take. The difficulty of charging through this beast tide was indeed extraordinary. If those people from earlier had not gone all out to charge forward, Xiao Yan’s group would have found it even more difficult to charge through this beast tide.</p>
 <p>“Increase our speed… do not allow the beast tide to completely stop us.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly cried out. The strength of his attacks suddenly soared. At the same time, their speed suddenly increased.</p>
 <p>The people behind formed a tacit understanding as Xiao Yan’s increased speed. They quickly followed and continued to clear the surroundings of the beast tide.</p>
 <p>This group of theirs was smaller than even an ant in this endless beast tide. Nevertheless, the strength that erupted from them was extremely powerful despite their small numbers, and the people here truly cooperated with each other. None of them were full of doubt like the people from earlier. Their advancement speed was not the least bit slower than the large contingent from earlier.</p>
 <p>A couple of groups were like small boats flowing against the current of an enormous beast tide. They swayed about and could overturn at any moment, but they ultimately remained afloat and charged through the growing strength of the beast tide with a constant speed, quickly reaching the end.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s palm blasted apart the head of a ferocious beast that had charged to within fifty feet from the group. After which, he once again acted with lightning-like speed as he forced back the ferocious beast on Gu Qing Yang’s left. Xun Er intervened and quickly killed it.</p>
 <p>“Thanks.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yan forced back a couple of ferocious beast with a strike of his palm. He quickly uttered words of thanks without turning his head. Some perspiration had formed on his forehead. Such a prolonged period of exhaustion was an extreme burden to him, and as he progressed deeper, the strength of the surrounding ferocious beasts had increased. By now, even if Xiao Yan, Gu Qing Yang, and the rest attacked, they would need to attack a couple of times before they would be able to kill a ferocious beast. Their advancement speed had significantly slowed.</p>
 <p>“If this continues, we will not be able to endure on even with the support of medicinal pills.” Xiao Yan exhaled as he made a statement.</p>
 <p>“Hun Yu’s group has disappeared…” Xun Er’s pretty eyes swept over the area in front of them as she suddenly said.</p>
 <p>“They have already charge out!” Gu Qing Yang was surprised as he exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Surprise flashed within Xiao Yan’s eyes when he heard this news. A joy quickly appeared on his face. “We are reaching the end of the beast tide!”</p>
 <p>“Quick, increase our speed!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his hand. His mind was braced as his sluggish attacks became ferocious once again. A couple of handprints of flames were shot out, shaking a couple of huge nine star Dou Zun beasts until they were forced to pull back. His body took the opportunity to rush forward. Xun Er and the rest quickly followed behind him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group suddenly became faster upon learning that they were about to break free from the beast tide. The Dou Qi within their bodies completely erupted and forced aside the ferocious beasts that were pouncing over…</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Dou Qi erupted from Xiao Yan’s body and formed a fire dragon that ruthlessly smashed into a thousand-foot-large ferocious beast body in front of him. That powerful force blasted its body until a bloody fog formed. The large beast’s body collapsed on the ground because of the great pain. Xiao Yan’s group took this opportunity to fly through the air beyond it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body landed on the ground after flying out. Dou Qi began to circulate within his body as a reflexive action, but he was stunned to find that no ferocious beasts had pounced over. Only then did he lift his head and sweep his eyes around. He discovered that his surroundings was completely empty. After turning his head, he saw a countless number of ferocious beasts were wildly roaring at them with scarlet eyes a hundred feet away, but they did not dare to charge over for some unknown reason…</p>
 <p>“Have we charged out?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group was startled when they saw the roaring beasts that did not dare approach. They heaved a sigh of relief within their hearts.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan turned after sighing in relief. He looked ahead to see an enormous lush green ancient tree standing alone within this spacious plain ten thousand feet away. A clear air spread from above the ancient tree. It would occasionally transform into various shapes, appearing mysterious and unfathomable.</p>
 <p>“Is this the legendary Bodhisattva Ancient Tree…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart began to pound as he looked at the ancient tree standing in the distance. An extremely old aura surrounded it.</p>
