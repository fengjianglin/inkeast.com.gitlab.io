 <p><strong><u>Chapter 303: Jia Lao’s Strength</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Not qualified?”</p>
 <p>Some shock surfaced on Jia Lao’s gentle old face. He immediately turned a strange gaze toward Xiao Yan. With Hai Bo Dong’s Dou Huang class strength, he actually said that he was not qualified to be this little fellow’s teacher? Did he really have such great potential?</p>
 <p>Under the night sky, Nalan Yanran and the others could only speechlessly watch the laughing Hai Bo Dong. After they were dumbstruck for a while, they treated these words of Hai Bo Dong as a joke. In this Jia Ma Empire, if a Dou Huang were to release news that he wanted to accept disciples, there would be an unknown number of people with outstanding talent swarming over quickly to fight for the spot. Being able to become the disciple of a Dou Huang basically represented that one possessed the capability to become a strong person.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Old Hai is just joking. Jia Lao, please don’t mind him. It’s just that the little me already has a teacher and naturally cannot switch to someone else so carelessly.” Xiao Yan shook his head as he said with a smile.</p>
 <p>By his side, Hai Bo Dong was silent. Back then, despite having recovered his Dou Huang strength, Xiao Yan still gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. Later on, the terrifying level of the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ that Xiao Yan had displayed when fighting with the two mysterious Dou Huangs caused Hai Bo Dong’s fear of him to grow even more.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan’s current strength had appeared to have greatly declined since he displayed the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’s power, within Hai Bo Dong’s heart, Xiao Yan was almost a strong person that was of his equal or even one that surpassed him. Therefore, when he heard Jia Lao ask if Xiao Yan was his disciple, he could not help but laugh involuntarily and reply in this manner.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Jia Lao smiled slighty. His gaze swept across Hai Bo Dong’s face without leaving any trace. His heart become increasingly shocked. With his knowledge of Hai Bo Dong, he naturally knew that the latter’s character would seldom joke in such a manner.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me that what he said is the truth?” Jia Lao muttered softly in his heart and could not help but asked, “Young friend Yan Xiao, may I know the name of your teacher? Perhaps the old me is acquainted with him.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, I’m sorry, Jia Lao. Before I came out, teacher had told me not to reveal his name since he likes to keep a low profile and has been living deep in the mountains all his life. I think that Jia Lao may have never heard of him.” Xiao Yan said apologetically.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, it doesn’t matter. There are many strong people who have unique characters. I have also met some strong people that live in isolation and know of their indifferent character.” Jia Lao smiled and shook his head. His heart still had some doubt regarding Xiao Yan’s words. Being able to let Hai Bo Dong say those words was a treatment that even Jia Lao himself had never received. Therefore, Yan Xiao’s teacher should be someone who was stronger than Hai Bo Dong or even himself...</p>
 <p>Although the Jia Ma Empire was vast enough where it was not surprising for countless of strong people to live in isolation deep within the mountains, as the guardian of the empire’s imperial family, Jia Lao was able to borrow the empire’s ability and vaguely learn about some of the strong people that lived in isolation within the Jia Ma Empire. However, he had really never heard of any place where there was someone living in isolation who corresponded to the legendary class strong person that he had imagined.</p>
 <p>With their bodies suspended in midair, Nalan Jie and Primer Tengshan secretly exchanged glances. They could naturally sense that Hai Bo Dong’s words were not a joke. If it was true, then the teacher behind Yan Xiao… would have a strength that was terrifyingly strong...</p>
 <p>“Luckily I did not become enemies with him…” As the two of them exchanged glances, they managed to spot the rejoiceful emotion within each other. As the person in charge of their own clan, they clearly knew just what kind of terrifying power the strong people of such a class possessed.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. It is already quite late. Everyone should go back.” Hai Bo Dong lifted his head, eyed the silver moon that was gradually descending. He let out a yawn, clapped his hand and said.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, young friend Yan Xiao should also be attending tomorrow’s Alchemist Grand Meeting, right?” Jia Lao nodded his head and randomly asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. Jia Lao’s name was something that he had heard a couple of times from Hai Bo Dong. When he was fighting with the two mysterious Dou Huangs just outside Yan City back then, he had also heard the title ‘Old Demon’ from the two of them. In the Jia Ma Empire, he was the only one known to be able to contend with Queen Medusa. Therefore, the current Xiao Yan who did not have Yao Lao to protect him was extremely fearful of this Jia Lao. When he spoke, he was extremely courteous and cautious.</p>
 <p>As he recalled Queen Medusa, Xiao Yan’s hand involuntarily rubbed the ‘Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python’ who was quietly sleeping in Xiao Yan’s sleeve. Luckily, this little fellow was born with the knowledge to perfectly hide its Qi. Otherwise, it would definitely be discovered by strong people like the Old Demon and Hai Bo Dong.</p>
 <p>“Ah, this little fellow is also an unstable bomb…” Xiao Yan smiled bitterly and shook his head. Just thinking of Queen Medusa’s icy manner, his heart began to palpitate. This woman may be bewitching to the point of being intoxicating to people, but when she killed people, it was as easy and neat as killing a chicken. Xiao Yan believed that had he not promised Queen Medusa to help her obtain that so called ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ medicinal formula this time around, she would definitely take his little life the next time she woke up.</p>
 <p>“It seems I face restrictions everywhere when Teacher is not around. Looks like I need to hurry up and get my hands on the Nalan clan’s ‘Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva’. Otherwise, it is really uncomfortable having my life molded in someone else’s hand…” Xiao Yan smiled bitterly and shook his head. After losing Yao Lao, he finally realized that his situation was actually very dangerous.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, that thing is the stage for young people to compete. Tomorrow, I may go and take a look and see how many outstanding people that even Old Man Hai cannot stop praising.” Jia Lao smiled and turned his gaze to the top of that huge tree. He said faintly, “Little Yue-er, it is already so late, yet you are still blindly muddling along outside. You better follow me back.”</p>
 <p>“Yes…” Hearing Jia Lao’s words, the Little Princess who had usually appeared quirky could only helplessly give a reply. She then obediently came forward. Jia Lao beckoned with his hand and a suction force pulled her to his side where she was suspended without moving.</p>
 <p>“Niece Yanran, Liu Ling boy, help me send my regards when you see your Teachers.”Carrying the Little Princess with one hand, Jia Lao smiled toward Nalan Yanran and Liu Ling. Immediately, his gaze was thrown at Mu Zhan, whose face was filled with respect. He said with another smile, “Little fellow from the Mu clan. Have you returned? This time around, you better be still and quiet. Otherwise, you will have to be expelled out again.”</p>
 <p>“Definitely.” Hearing this, Mu Zhan’s head nodded like a little chicken feeding on grain. In front of this old demon whom Mu Zhan had to respectively greet upon sight, his arrogant and imposing manner no longer remained.</p>
 <p>Seeing that they were about to disband, Xiao Yan lifted his head. He cupped his fist together at Nalan Jie and Primer Tengshan before facing Hai Bo Dong and asking, “Shall we go?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, let’s go.” Hai Bo Dong lazily nodded his head. He only said his goodbyes to Jia Lao. As for Nalan Jie and Primer Tengshan, they were simply ignored by him. The pair of icy wings gradually surfaced. He flapped them, carrying a cold wind as he disappeared into midair.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, Jia Lao, goodbye.” Xiao Yan smiled at Jia Lao. The pair of wings on his back were flapped and he turned into a ray of light which followed Hai Bo Dong in front of him.</p>
 <p>Seeing Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong leaving, Jia Lao also did not remain any longer. Carrying the Little Princess with one hand, his pale-yellow colored Dou Qi wings flapped. With a ‘xiu’ sound, he disappeared from sight, leaving only a faint laughter that lingered in midair.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, please scatter…”</p>
 <p>In the night sky, two rays of light swiftly flashed and disappeared.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you didn’t leak out any information regarding me, did you?” Xiao Yan, who was following closely behind Hai Bo Dong, suddenly said.</p>
 <p>“No… I know that you want to hide your identity. I did not mention even the slightest bit regarding you to that Old Demon. You don’t need to worry.” Hai Bo Dong shook his head and said.</p>
 <p>“Try your best to keep it a secret. For the Misty Cloud Sect to survive in the Jia Ma Empire for so many years, it is likely that they have quite a good relationship with the imperial family. We must be careful.” Xiao Yan sighed.</p>
 <p>“Have your injuries not recovered yet?” Hai Bo Dong nodded before abruptly asking.</p>
 <p>The tip of Xiao Yan’s heart jumped. His face remained unchanged as he nodded slightly and said, “That thing is really too terrifying. The aftermath is really too serious… but I think it should be soon. As long as I get my hands on the ‘Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva’, I should be able to recover.”</p>
 <p>“Back then I had already told you not to be so impulsive, yet you insisted on doing that crazy act of merging two ‘Heavenly Flames’...” Hai Bo Dong helplessly shook his head and said, “That Old Demon’s strength has increased to much greater heights. Back then when I exchanged blows with him, I was entirely at a disadvantage. I think that the current him should be around an eight star or even nine star Dou Huang. Ah… if he has the luck, he might be able… to break through the barrier and become a Dou Zong.”</p>
 <p>“He’s that strong?” Although Xiao Yan had already anticipated this in his heart, he still could not help but be shocked when he heard Hai Bo Dong admit it.</p>
 <p>“That’s right… due to the relationship between me and the Primer clan, that fellow had always been very attentive toward me. He’s afraid that I would take advantage of the situation and overthrow their Jia Ma Empire imperial family. Yesterday, I accidentally allowed him to discover my Qi. From his words, he says that he wants to spar with me but does he really think I am a fool? Isn’t he clearly trying to display his strength and scare me off. That old man really won’t die.” Hai Bo Dong scolded.</p>
 <p>“He won’t be an obstacle to our matter, will he?” Xiao Yan frowned slightly and softly asked.</p>
 <p>“That won’t happen. Didn’t you see that the old fellow had also begun to be a little afraid of you? Uh, or perhaps I should say that he is afraid of the teacher behind you that doesn’t exist. As long as your strength has not been exposed, he would not dare to touch you in any way.” Hai Bo Dong voiced his thoughts.</p>
 <p>TL: Kinda confusing since Hai Bo Dong says that Xiao Yan had a lie in the raws. What I think it’s referring to is Xiao Yan’s lack of strength.</p>
 <p>“Therefore, you need to quickly recover your strength. As long as you recover your strength, we don’t need to be too worried of that Old Demon.”</p>
 <p>“I will do my best. However, if he goes overboard, then I will throw an ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ at the capital even if I have to endure serious injuries…” Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and said in a casual manner.</p>
 <p>“Uh… you lunatic…” Hearing this, Hai Bo Dong opened his mouth. A long while later, he finally bitterly choked out a sentence. After which, he no longer dared to say anything.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Hai Bo Dong had become quiet, Xiao Yan smiled and twisted his neck. In his heart, he softly muttered, “Tomorrow is the Alchemist Grand Meeting. Ah, I better get my hands on that ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ medicinal formula first. Before I go to the Misty Cloud Sect, I need to first calm Queen Medusa, this female fiend…”</p>
