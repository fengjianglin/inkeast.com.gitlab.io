 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1360: Bloodline Inheritance</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group followed Xiao Xuan to the deepest region of the Heavenly Tomb before they gradually came to a stop. Their surroundings were as black as ink because there was almost no light. One appeared to be standing in the empty realm as a kind of lost panicked feeling rose within one’s heart.</p>
 <p>“This is the deepest part of the Heavenly Tomb…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xuan smiled as he spoke. He pointed to an ancient stone tablet in front. This tablet stood in this dark-black region in a lonely manner. It was quiet and lonely, appearing as though it had existed for a long time. “This is my tomb…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes followed the direction Xiao Xuan had indicated and saw an ancient stone tablet. Even though a countless number of years had passed, the stone tablet still emitted an aura that could not be described. This kind of aura was not intense, but it caused one’s soul to feel a flutter that could not be stopped.</p>
 <p>“The four of you should train outside the stone tablet. This place is where the energy in the Heavenly Tomb is the most dense. Other energy bodies do not dare to enter this area. Therefore, you need not worry about your safety…” Xiao Xuan looked at Gu Qing Yang’s group as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yang’s group looked at each other after hearing this. All they could do was smile bitterly and nod their heads. The only thing they could do when dealing with this person, who was once a top expert, was to completely obey him.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan and that girl from the Gu clan, follow me…” After randomly settling matters with Gu Qing Yang’s group, Xiao Xuan turned to Xiao Yan and Xun Er. After which, he placed both of his hands behind him and slowly walked into the stone tablet. His body swiftly became pale as he disappeared upon contact with the stone tablet.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently exhaled when he saw this. He extended his hand to Xun Er and smiled as he said, “Let’s go…”</p>
 <p>“Aye.” The anxiousness in Xun Er’s heart completely disappeared as she looked at Xiao Yan’s smile. She obediently extended her soft hand and placed it in Xiao Yan’s palm, allowing him to pull her along as they slowly walked to the stone tablet.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, take good care of Xun Er!”</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yang cupped his hands and spoke in a deep voice as he watched Xiao Yan and Xun Er walk toward the stone tablet. He knew that Xiao Yan would likely spend most of his time inside the tomb after entering it.</p>
 <p>“All of you should also take care…” Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He extended his hand and gently touched the stone tablet. A bloodline connection was emitted from the stone tablet as a circular light scattered from the stone talisman, wrapping around Xiao Yan and Xun Er. Finally, the light scattered, and their figures completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yang and the rest looked at each other after watching the two of them disappear. All they could do was bitterly laugh before softly sighing</p>
 <p>“Forget it, given elder Xiao Xuan’s ability, he will not do anything to Xun Er. Let’s just quietly wait here for them to come out…”</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yang shook his head. After which, he randomly found a stone platform and sat down. He gradually entered his training state. Gu Zhen and the other two could only nod their heads when they saw him sit down. They each found a spot and began to train…</p>
 <p>The light that filled one’s eyes slowly disappeared. Xiao Yan and Xun Er slowly opened their eyes. Xiao Yan looked at the ancient house that had appeared in front of him, and he involuntarily became a little absent-minded. It was unexpected that this simple and ordinary tablet actually hid such a mysterious place. It was indeed worthy of being an elite Dou Sheng’s resting place…</p>
 <p>Xiao Xuan stood with his hands behind him in the middle of the large hall in front. There was a clear pond in front of him. Numerous green lotuses were suspended on it, emitting a faint relaxing fragrance.</p>
 <p>“Can you tell me about the situation of the Xiao clan?” Xiao Xuan sighed when he heard the soft sound of footsteps behind him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment when he heard this request. Finally, he said with honesty, “The Xiao clan no longer exists. There is only the declined Xiao family left…” Xiao Yan structured his thoughts after uttering these words. After which, he spoke in detail about the various unexpected changes of the Xiao clan during these years.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xuan slowly nodded after the last word sounded. His face did not reveal much emotion.</p>
 <p>“The decline of the Xiao clan is something that I had already expected. At the very least, there are still descendants remaining. It has not reached the point of despair…” Xiao Xuan’s voice was gentle, appearing to possess a demonic strength. He seemed to to recall some things while Xiao Yan, who had become a little emotional, once again became calm.</p>
 <p>“Do you have anything that you wish to ask?” Xiao Xuan looked at Xiao Yan and asked a question with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Is ancestor really still living now?” Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before asking. If Xiao Xuan were able to live in another form, the Xiao clan would prosper. With such a peak expert, it was likely that even the Hun clan would have to be cautious.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xuan looked at Xiao Yan. A moment later, he slowly shook his head and said, “What you are seeing now is merely a remnant part of my soul. When I died back then, I had instructed some people to deliver me to the Heavenly Tomb. Only then could I take on this current form and await your arrival. However, this is only limited to the Heavenly Tomb. I will immediately disappear once I leave here…”</p>
 <p>Disappointment flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes when he heard this information. He bitterly laughed, “The strength of the current Xiao clan is too weak. Having lost the bloodline strength, we are unable to fight with the other ancient clans. Someone like me is considered unusual to them…”</p>
 <p>“When the Xiao clan was still around back then, I had already sensed that the Dou Di bloodline was about to be exhausted. You should understand that if the bloodline strength was becoming exhausted back then, the Xiao clan would have been annihilated by those enemies with ill intent…” Xiao Xuan lifted his head. His eyes seemed to be recalling a distant memory. “The only way to replenish the Dou Di bloodline is for another Dou Di to appear, but this is too difficult. The me back then was a little too arrogant and did not think that I would be blocked in front of the Dou Di class. After discussing with the many Elders within the clan, we decided to stake everything…”</p>
 <p>“We used a secret technique and transfer most of the bloodline strength within the clan to my body. I understand… that it was the final hope of all the clan members…” Xiao Xuan inhaled a deep breath of air. Some pain finally surfaced on his face. He had disappointed all the members of the Xiao clan.</p>
 <p>“But… I still ended up failing. When I was attempting to advance to the Dou Di class, the Hun clan launched a sneak attack. I ended up seriously injured, and I died…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was quiet when he heard Xiao Xuan’s self-reprimanding sigh. A moment later, he softly said, “That was the last method. If the bloodline strength was allowed to be exhausted, the Xiao clan would have difficulty escaping being destroyed… no one in the Xiao clan would ever blame you for this.”</p>
 <p>“However, if the strength of the bloodline has been exhausted, why is it that the clan tattoo has appeared on me?” Xiao Yan suddenly rubbed his brows and doubtfully asked.</p>
 <p>“The clan tattoo of the Xiao clan is not bestowed by another, it is created by oneself through training.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xuan smiled and continued, “I can sense the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change on you because I was the one who created it. It is unexpected that you have accidentally obtained it. I remember that I gave it to the Burning Flame Valley back then. The word ‘fate’ is indeed unpredictable.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan revealed a stunned face when he heard these words. A moment later, he suddenly recalled the name that he had seen when he was inheriting the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change at the Burning Flame Valley.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Xuan? That Xiao Xuan there is the ancestor of the Xiao clan! The matters of this world is really unbelievable…”</p>
 <p>“Of course, the Skyfire Three Mysterious that you practice is still lacking the final step. It is precisely because it is lacking this final step that you have been unable to create a clan tattoo…” Xiao Xuan softly explained.</p>
 <p>An excitement immediately surged within Xiao Yan’s heart when he heard this. His eyes looked at Xiao Xuan with anticipation.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, relax. I have waited alone for so many years in order to hand everything to you. This final step of the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change will naturally be handed to you.” Xiao Xuan shook his head and smiled when he saw Xiao Yan’s excitement.</p>
 <p>“However, even if you form the clan tattoo, it is difficult to truly unleash it to its peak without the support of the bloodline strength…” Xiao Xuan voiced his thoughts.</p>
 <p>“Since it is called the clan tattoo, there must naturally be a bloodline strength as a source…” Xiao Xuan nodded as he observed Xiao Yan’s eyes dim. He smiled and stepped into the pond before walking to the middle. With a wave of his hand, one could see the water of the pond slowly rotate. Following the swirling of the pond water, numerous blood lights were slowly emitted from Xiao Xuan’s body. Finally, they followed his legs and entered the pond water.</p>
 <p>Following the numerous unusual blood light rays entering the pond, the clear water began to gradually turn blood-red. At a glance, it appeared just like a pool of blood. At the same time, Xiao Xuan’s black hair began to gradually turn white. His face had also become old.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression changed when he saw this change. He was just about to speak when Xiao Xuan, who was still in the pond, slowly shook his head. He smiled and said, “Back then, I used all of my strength to preserve some of the Dou Di bloodline, and I used many techniques to seal it. All that I was hoping for was to once again create a clan member who possessed the bloodline strength…”</p>
 <p>“The current me is only a remnant soul. All I can do is drift in this Heavenly Tomb. The matter of revitalizing the Xiao clan can no longer be completed by me… however, the heavens do not wish for my Xiao clan to end. I believe that you will do better than me.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan felt an ache in his heart when he looked at the aging Xiao Xuan, whose eyes had become much gentler. He could sense that this ancestor of the Xiao clan, who had possessed a shocking talent, had carried a big burden.</p>
 <p>“This bloodline strength also possesses some of the energy that I had sealed away when I was alive. My descendant… hopefully, you will be able to complete the promise that I have made to the members of the Xiao clan back then!”</p>
