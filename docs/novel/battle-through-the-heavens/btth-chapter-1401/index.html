 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1401: Ancient Map Mystery</u></strong></p>
 <p>Yao Lao smiled when he saw Xiao Yan’s joyous expression. He naturally understood just how much effort Xiao Yan had put in to search for these map fragments.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, the activity we created has been too much. It will likely attract the notice of some experts. Although we might not be afraid of them, we will end up attracting some unnecessary trouble if others learned we have the complete ancient map in our hands.” Yao Lao’s eyes swept around him before he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Aye.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded when he heard this and forcefully suppressed the anxious emotions in his heart. He was aware that unnecessary trouble would not be all they would face if word of this were to spread. It would still be alright if it was only a map fragment, but they possessed the complete ancient map in their hands, causing its temptation to soar. Everyone knew that one would be able to obtain information related to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame with this map. Regardless of how strong the Falling Star Pavilion was, it would end up in extremely great trouble because of this demon flame.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao did not remain any longer after speaking. With a wave of his hand, he rushed into the distance, and within a couple of flashes, he had vanished across the horizon. Xiao Yan and the two ladies quickly followed behind him.</p>
 <p>The area gradually became quiet after Xiao Yan’s group disappeared into the distance. This kind of silence continued for over ten minutes before it was suddenly broken by the rushing sound of wind. Over a dozen figures rushed over from the distance. After which, they remained in the midair. Their eyes were stunned when they saw the mountain range had turned into flat land.</p>
 <p>“What a frightening destructive force… I wonder who exchanged blows in this place. They actually destroyed this mountain range until nothing remained.”</p>
 <p>Numerous extremely shocked voices could be heard in the sky. A moment later, a sharp-eyed person finally caught sight of a corpse on the ground. Some people quickly rushed down, and an exclamation spread across the land soon after.</p>
 <p>“It is one of the three He demon ghosts, Di He Zi? This old ghost had a peak Dou Zun strength. Who could kill him?”</p>
 <p>“The three He demon ghosts are usually extremely close. Now that Di He Zi has died, the conditions of the other two probably isn’t any better…”</p>
 <p>“Hiss… these three fellows have committed all sorts of evil deeds and deserve this fate, but I wonder which expert possesses such skill. The three of them can fight with an elite Ban Sheng if they joined hands…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group had already disappeared into the distance while these people were feeling extremely shocked because of Di He Zi’s corpse…</p>
 <p>The rushing sound of wind appeared five thousand kilometers away from the location of the big battle earlier. A couple of figures appeared on the top of a mountain. They were surprisingly Xiao Yan’s group.</p>
 <p>“No one will be able to chase us here. I have already removed our auras along the way. Even an elite Dou Sheng would have difficulty chasing us.” Yao Lao landed and laughed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan grinned and nodded. Their gains this time around were really too plentiful. These three old ghosts might have done all sorts of evil things, but they did possess a rich stash. Xiao Yan’s group had ended up benefiting this time around.</p>
 <p>“Try that ancient map. I am very curious to witness what happens when all of the fragments have been gathered.” Yao Lao waved his hand. The space around them suddenly became distorted. With the sealing of this space, they would be able to react in time should anything unexpected occur.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded after hearing Yao Lao’s words. His finger rubbed his Storage Ring and a few ancient map fragments flew out. They remained suspended in front of him.</p>
 <p>An excitement once again surged into Xiao Yan’s eyes as he examined these ancient map fragments, which appeared extremely old. He involuntarily rubbed his hands together before he carefully began to put the map fragments together according to the lines.</p>
 <p>The speed at which Xiao Yan put them together was extremely slow. As time flowed, a complete ancient map gradually appeared in front of Xiao Yan’s group.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan heaved a sigh of relief in his heart after the final map fragment was reformed. His heated eyes studied the ancient map before he became slightly startled. The complete ancient map did indeed reveal a map of some land, but the lines on it were quite ordinary. There was no exact target or route. At a glance, it was like a picture that had randomly been drawn.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face was startled as he looked at the lines on the map. His heart gradually sank. Could it be that the ancient map, which he had searched for so many years, contained no information?</p>
 <p>“Do not be anxious. This ancient map is extremely old. It is impossible for it to be used to intentionally fool someone… it definitely is a mystery.” Yao Lao appeared much calmer as he voiced his thoughts.</p>
 <p>“Hu…” Xiao Yan let out a long breath. He tried his best to calm himself as his eyes slowly sweep over the ancient map in an attempt to find something different. However, there was nothing suspicious about other than an extremely demonic fire lotus.</p>
 <p>“Try dripping a drop of blood on it.” Yao Lao thought for a moment and came up with a suggestion.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment after hearing his words. He nodded and cut his middle finger. A drop of blood landed on a corner of the ancient map before slowly seeping into it. However, there was no reaction after everyone waited for a moment. There was only a drop of blood on the map.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao softly sighed when he saw nothing happen. He shook his head and fell silent</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled as he continued to examine the ancient map. There was a disappointment that could not be hidden in his eyes. Cai Lin by the side also shook her head and felt it was inappropriate to say anything. She was aware of just how much effort Xiao Yan had put in for the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. They had obtained this complete map after much difficulty, but now found that it did not contain any information. This was naturally quite a big blow to him.</p>
 <p>Silence reigned between the few of them, causing the atmosphere to fill with pressure and become heavy. The joy from having been victorious earlier had completely scattered.</p>
 <p>This silence continued for a long time before Xiao Yan finally sighed. He glanced at the ancient map in front of him and shook his head. “Since it is useless, what is the point of keeping it.”</p>
 <p>A cluster of Heavenly Flames suddenly rose in Xiao Yan’s palm after his words sounded. This flame swept over the ancient map.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s sudden act shocked Yao Lao. Yao Lao was just about to stop Xiao Yan when his eyes suddenly shrank. He questioned, “Why can this ancient map not be burned?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan and the two ladies hurriedly shifted their eyes to the cluster of flames when they heard Yao Lao’s voice. They saw that this ancient map, which appeared as though it would break if it was pulled, did not wilt no matter how Xiao Yan’s Heavenly Flame burned it. Moreover, it did not show any signs of being incinerated.</p>
 <p>“Increase the strength of the flame!”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s eyes focused on the unaffected ancient map. He suddenly commanded in a deep voice. Xiao Yan’s Heavenly Flame was formed from the merger of four Heavenly Flames. Its strength could burn mountains and boil seas, yet it was unable to burn an ancient map. There was definitely something amiss!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard command, but he hurriedly urged his Heavenly Flame on.</p>
 <p>“Hu hu…”</p>
 <p>The flame fiercely burned. Its high temperature caused the space around them to distort, yet no matter how Xiao Yan strengthened the flame, the ancient map did not show any signs of turning into ashes. However, as the intensity of the flame increased, the lines on the map had slowly become brighter. They appeared as though they were intending to break free from the map.</p>
 <p>Joy was revealed in everyone’s eyes when they saw the lines. Xiao Yan continued to strengthen the flame without any urging and the Heavenly Flame in his body was forced to its limit!</p>
 <p>As the flame burned with increasing intensity, the lines on the ancient map became brighter. At a certain moment, the ancient map suddenly shook. Many lines leaped from the ancient map and turned into ancient characters that floated in the air in front of everyone.</p>
 <p>Two moons appear at once to fill the sky.</p>
 <p>Nine planets form at grand array on high.</p>
 <p>The all engulfing tide gives birth.</p>
 <p>Demonic flame descends again to earth.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao slowly read these ancient characters as a shock gradually surged over his face.</p>
 <p>“What does this mean?” Xiao Yan frowned. He didn’t understand the meaning of the characters.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao softly exhaled. He said, “Two moons appearing together and nine stars aligning is referring to a special natural phenomenon. However, this occurrence only appears once every thousand years. A world tide appearing refers to the unusual phenomenon that will be created because of this scene… you should also understand the final sentence. The day when the world tide appears is the day that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame appears in the world…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was stunned. He immediately asked, “It will only appear once in a thousand years? Does that not mean that we will not have a chance…”</p>
 <p>“If we count the years, nine hundred ninety-seven years have passed since the last world tide. In other words… there are only three years left…” Yao Lao shook his head and sighed. He said, “It’s just as well. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is too powerful. Forget about you, even I would not be able to subdue it. If one forcefully tried to subdue it, one would suffer from a backlash… these three years will give you sufficient time to increase your strength.”</p>
 <p>“In these three years, you must reach the Dou Sheng class. Otherwise, you will only be able to watch the demon flame appear…”</p>
 <p>“Ugh, I have worked hard for many years to only obtain this information…” Xiao Yan bitterly laughed. According to what the characters read, the demon flame will appear in the world when the correct time arrived. At that time, everyone would have the chance to subdue it. What was the point of finding the ancient map?</p>
 <p>Yao Lao spread his hands. If one thought about it this way, it was indeed not worthwhile.</p>
 <p>“Ugh…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan helplessly sighed. He glanced at the ancient map that remained in the flame. He extended his hand into the flame to retrieve it, but the moment he made contact with the ancient map, the demon lotus image on it suddenly moved. The demonic lotus appeared as though it was alive as it turned into a glow that shot into the spot between Xiao Yan’s brows!</p>
 <p>This sudden change caused the expression of Yao Lao drastically to change!</p>
