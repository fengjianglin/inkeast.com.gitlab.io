 <p><strong><u>Chapter 484: A deal</u></strong></p>
 <p>The shock on the gray-clothed man’s face continued for quite awhile before it slowly became fainter. He coldly looked at Xiao Yan and questioned, “Why should I believe that you have such ability? I once let quite a number of elites within the Alchemist Department check out the Fire Poison within my body, but all of them said it is not possible to dispel it. On what basis can you do it?”</p>
 <p>“The depth in which you are afflicted with the Fire Poison is indeed the first time I have seen such a case.” Xiao Yan glanced at the face of the gray-clothed man where fury had once again surfaced. He continued on indifferently, “However, do you have any other choice now? Perhaps you yourself might have already sensed that the Fire Poison is currently quietly eroding your sense of reasoning. If it continues like this for a long time, I’m afraid that you might become a powderkeg that will explode at the slightest contact.”</p>
 <p>The expression of the gray-clothed man changed slightly. These words of Xiao Yan had indeed hit the deepest part of his heart. The man hesitated for a moment before he tightened his fist and slowly turned it away from Xiao Yan’s front. He said in a deep voice, “Who exactly are you? If you really have the confidence to expel the Fire Poison in my body, you should likely not be a nobody.”</p>
 <p>“New student Xiao Yan.” Xiao Yan smiled and answered as he cupped his hands toward the gray-clothed man.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan? He is the leader of that ‘Pan’s Gate,’ Xiao Yan?” When Xiao Yan’s words sounded, a ripple naturally rose from around him. Most of the Inner Academy students had heard of the matters regarding ‘Pan’s Gate’ and Xiao Yan during this period of time.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan? I seem to have heard this name before… It is of that fellow who finished off all of the older students during the ‘Fire Energy Hunting Competition’ right?” The gray-clothed man mused for a moment before shock immediately flashed across his face as he eyed Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ignored the numerous strange gazes around him as he smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>“Most of those who participate in the ‘Fire Energy Hunting Competition’ are useless people. It is not surprising that you defeated them… you are an alchemist?” The gray-clothed man did not give any face toward those older students who participated in the Hunting Competition. In the end, he still could not help but use a somewhat doubtful tone to ask Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Xiao Yan flicked his finger. A wisp of green-colored flame appeared on the tip of his finger. “I think that while it is not something absolute, being able to summon out an essence flame at the Da Dou Shi class should be able to prove my status, right? If you don’t believe me, I can let you take a look at my alchemist robe.”</p>
 <p>The gray-clothed man stared at the wisp of green-colored flame. Some shock flashed across his eyes as he sensed the high temperature being emitted before he spoke, “This flame of yours is indeed a little stronger than the ones those fellows in the Alchemist Department. I believe you. But… even if you can expel the Fire Poison within my body, it seems that just taking away that green vine, which is obviously extraordinary, with just a cure is a little…”</p>
 <p>When he spoke until this point, the gray-clothed man smiled. “Why don’t we do it like this. If you can really completely expel the Fire Poison in my body, this green vine will be yours if you add a hundred days of ‘Fire Energy’ on top of it. What do you say?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan lifted his eyebrows. He eyed the man in front of him and his gaze stared at the eyes filled with a red glow. It was really unexpected that this man, who appeared to be hot-tempered, would actually have this profiteer side to him.</p>
 <p>“I am not adding…” Xiao Yan shook his head indifferently. He said in a manner as though nothing had happened, “It does not matter to me if you agree with this deal. Although I need this thing, it is not as though I must get my hands on it now. As for the Fire Poison in your body, if you continue to delay treating it, I think that even an alchemist grandmaster will be helpless. If you are unwilling, then we can forget about it…”</p>
 <p>“You are threatening me?” The gray-clothed man frowned and spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“The truth is just as I have said. I can delay but you can’t. Hence, you can forget about your luxurious dream of adding other prices. This is because you are at a disadvantage. Of course, if you are one of those kind of people who view death as going home, I can only admit that I am unlucky. However, from the looks of it, it doesn’t appear that you are someone like that…” Xiao Yan ridiculed.</p>
 <p>“You…” The gray-clothed man was slightly dull. He clenched his teeth and violently nodded a moment later. He said fiercely, “Alright, I agree to your terms. As long as you can completely expel the Fire Poison within my body, this green vine will be yours. However, you should remember that it has to be completely expelled! If I sense that there is still Fire Poison residue remaining at that time, forget about obtaining the green vine. I’m afraid that you will still have to suffer the pain of the flash.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly. He flicked his sleeves, turned his body and walked out of the trading area. Seeing him walking over, the congested human flow hurriedly parted and formed a path.</p>
 <p>The gray-clothed man behind him turned around and squeezed all of the things on the stone table into his storage ring as though he was throwing garbage around. After which, he swiftly followed Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p>“How long has the Fire Poison been accumulated within your body?” Xiao Yan frowned and asked the gray-clothed man seated in front of him within a quiet room. Before he helped the latter expel the poison, he needed to clearly inquire about the latter’s condition.</p>
 <p>“Around one and a half years or so…” When he mentioned this, the gray-clothed man’s expression became ugly. However, when he remembered that the person opposite him was the alchemist that would help him expel the poison, he could only swallowed the irritation in his heart as he replied, “During that period of time, I anxiously needed to raise my strength. Hence, I continued to undertake a retreat within the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.’ Moreover, my retreat was one to two months at one go. The Fire Poison continued to accumulate in this matter. In the end, when I discovered it, the Fire Poison had already firmly intertwined itself with my Dou Qi and cannot be separated.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, I am called Lin Yan. You can directly call me by my name.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He stared at the reddened eyes of Lin Yan. It was a long while later before he withdrew his gaze. After musing for nearly seven to eight minutes, he slowly said, “The depth of which the Fire Poison has accumulated in your body had somewhat exceeded my expectation… if you don’t wish to die, you better be quiet. I did not say that it cannot be cured.”</p>
 <p>Before Xiao Yan had completed the first part of his sentence, Lin Yan on the opposite side slapped the table with reddened eyes as he immediately scolded angrily. This fellow’s temper actually gave one a headache.</p>
 <p>“Hmph. Don’t beat around the bush when you speak to me… in any case, I don’t care. Only once you have successfully helped me expel the Fire Poison will I give you the green vine.” Although he sat down after being chided by Xiao Yan, Lin Yan still rubbed his nose and snorted.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan shook his head with a bitter smile. He said, “Since the Fire Poison is too deep, it is clearly an impossible task to expel it all at once. Hence, I can only adopt a gradual method.”</p>
 <p>“How slow will it be?”</p>
 <p>“This is an ‘Ice Spirit Pill.’ It can temporarily suppress the Fire Poison within your body and cause it to be unable to erode your reasoning. Remember, take one every day. There are a total of fifteen of them which is enough for you to consume them for half a month…” Xiao Yan took out a jade bottle from his storage ring and placed it on the table.</p>
 <p>Lin Yan swiftly grabbed the jade bottle and poured out one of the pills with some doubt. The snow-white round medicinal pill emitted a faint coldness. Seeing this, joy flashed across Lin Yan’s face as he stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
 <p>As the ‘Ice Spirit Pill’ entered his body, it gradually transformed into an icy-cool feeling, causing the red glow in Lin Yan’s eyes to quietly weaken a little.</p>
 <p>The weakening of the Fire Poison was naturally most clearly felt by Lin Yan. Immediately, there was some conviction in the gaze he used to look at Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Of course, the ‘Ice Spirit Pill’ can only suppress it and cannot totally expel it…” Xiao Yan fondled his chin and mused for a while once more. Suddenly, he waved his hand and a medicinal cauldron appeared on the table. He muttered, “Looks like I have to put in some effort…”</p>
 <p>“Go and guard the door. Don’t allow anyone to come in and disturb me. I need to refine some things.” Xiao Yan waved his hand at Lin Yan and commanded.</p>
 <p>Lin Yan was startled when he heard this. Even Lin Xiuya, Yan Hao, and those extremely strong people did not have such courage to open their mouths and ask him to guard a door… However, after thinking about the Fire Poison in his body, Lin Yan smacked his mouth and could only helplessly nod his head. He honestly stood up and went out before closing the door.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Lin Yan had did as he was told and left, Xiao Yan finally turned his gaze to the medicinal cauldron in front of him. He flicked his finger and a wisp of green-colored flame shot into it. Finally, it turned into a raging flame that rose within the medicinal cauldron.</p>
 <p>As the fire increased the temperature of the medicinal cauldron, Xiao Yan took out over ten medicinal ingredients from his storage ring. Finally, he took out a Monster Core that was emitting a faint cold air and placed it among the medicinal ingredients.</p>
 <p>“I must really put in some capital if I want to obtain the Green Wood Celestial Vine…” Xiao Yan pursed his mouth and shook his head as he eyed the rank three Ice Affinity Monster Core that he had bought earlier. The sum of all of the medicinal ingredients would at least reach around one hundred and fifty thousand gold coins. However, Xiao Yan could only bear the pain of this loss for the Green Wood Celestial Vine.</p>
 <p>There were quite a number of things that needs to be refined this time around, but they did not need overly precise control. Hence, in the hands of Xiao Yan, whose refining level had already reached that of a tier four alchemist, not too much time would be wasted.</p>
 <p>While the green-colored flame writhed, the medicinal ingredients on the table were thrown into the cauldron one after another. Around ten minutes later, the lone Ice Affinity Monster Core on the table was also thrown into the medicinal cauldron.</p>
 <p>As it was shrouded by the raging flame, an ice-like snow-white liquid became suspended above the green flame. As it rolled, threads of cold air began to rise. They intertwined with the flame and turned into a substantial white fog that rose out from within the medicinal cauldron.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes stared directly at the snow-white liquid emitting a cold air. After the liquid was grilled by the flame for another few minutes, Xiao Yan’s face slowly relaxed. He flicked his finger and the cover of the medicinal cauldron automatically fell off. With a wave of his hand, a suction force drew up the snow-white liquid in the cauldron, forming a graceful arc. Finally, it was accurately poured into a jade bottle on the surface of the table.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan heaved a long sigh of relief as he stared at the jade bottle which was filled with cold liquid. He smiled, waved his hand and stored the medicinal cauldron on the table. Only then did he face the door and open his mouth. He said indifferently, “Come in.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Xiao Yan’s voice, Lin Yan, who had become impatient from waiting in front of the door, hurriedly pushed it open and entered. He looked at Xiao Yan with a face filled with anticipation. “Are you done?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. He threw the jade bottle on the table to Lin Yan. The latter hurriedly rushed to catch it.</p>
 <p>“This is the ‘Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid.’ Drop one drop in a large basin filled with clear water. After that quietly sit and train within it for half an hour. Do it once every day until the liquid is completely used up. At that time if there is still remnant Fire Poison, I will help you refine it again. Remember, you cannot go the the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ to train during this period of time. Otherwise, these medicinal effects will be lost.” Xiao Yan reminded.</p>
 <p>“Alright.”</p>
 <p>Lin Yan was somewhat excited as he held the jade bottle. He faced Xiao Yan and spoke with a smile, “As long as you can expel the Fire Poison within my body, I, Lin Yan will owe you a favor.”</p>
 <p>“I am not too interested in your favor. It is fine as long as you remember to hand me the green vine at that time.” Xiao Yan waved his hand. After which, he walked out of the door, “I will now go to the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ to undertake a retreat. It is likely that I will take quite a while. There is no need for you to look for me during this period of time.”</p>
 <p>“Hei, alright…” Lin Yan nodded. He eyed Xiao Yan’s back and suddenly spoke with a smile, “Little fellow, I will help take care a little of that ‘Pan’s Gate’ of yours during this period that you are training. With I, Lin Yan, around, don’t mention the crappy ‘White Gang.’ Even Lin Xiu Ya’s ‘Wolf Teeth’ will not dare to do anything to ‘Pan’s Gate.’”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan paused his footsteps. A smile lifted at the corner of his mouth as he nodded slightly.</p>
 <p>“In that case, thank you very much Senior Lin Yan…”</p>
