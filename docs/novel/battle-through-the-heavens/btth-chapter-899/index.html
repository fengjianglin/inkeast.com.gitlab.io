 <p><strong><u>Chapter 899: Mysterious Bones</u></strong></p>
 <p>The hesitation in Xiao Yan’s eyes slowly disappeared after Xiao Yan made a decision in his heart. He lowered his head and looked at the endless magma. A solemness flashed onto his face. He was uncertain about just how deep this underground magma was. One must possess an unusually powerful strength if one wanted to enter deep within it. This was because there was a great pressure from the already hot magma, something that an ordinary expert would not be able to endure.</p>
 <p>According to his prediction, one must require at least the strength of a Dou Zong class if one wanted to enter the bottom of this magma. An ordinary Dou Huang or someone without powerful Dou Qi would likely have their fortune hang in the balance if they were to head down. Of course, Xiao Yan was an exception. This was the place where the Fallen Heart Flame was born. With him being the current owner of the Fallen Heart Flame, it would be much easier for him to move about.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his hand as he stood on the magma while deep in thought. The Heavy Xuan Ruler once again appeared in his hand. After which, he swung his sleeve and the heavy ruler transformed into a black-colored figure that shot out. Finally, it smashed violently into the wall. The powerful strength caused the heavy ruler to penetrate a couple of feet into the mountain wall.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan had added a thread of Spiritual Strength to the heavy ruler. This would be his signpost. His sight under the magma would be extremely blurry. No one knew if it was deep or shallow. The magma was also extremely dense. Moreover, its size was incomparably vast. If one were to randomly explore it, who knew exactly how one would return to the surface of the magma? Under chaos, one might travel increasingly further from the signpost. Even if anything went wrong, Xiao Yan would be able to quickly and accurately find a route and save his life.</p>
 <p>After doing all of this, Xiao Yan finally relaxed. He inhaled a breath of air as a jade-green flame slowly surged out. Finally, it wrapped all around his body. From a distance, it was as though he was a cluster of burning jade-green flames.</p>
 <p>“Splash!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ceased feeling any hesitation after the flame completely surrounded his body. He entered the viscous magma. Waves of bubbles rose and swiftly exploded. After which, the seemingly endless magma world once again descended into a deathly silence. Only the black ruler on the mountain wall remained. Emitting a faint vague glow, it appeared much like a street lamp…</p>
 <p>The hot temperature and the pressure immediately surged from all directions after Xiao Yan entered the magma world. It was as though it wanted to squeeze Xiao Yan into meat paste. However, after powerful Dou Qi poured out of his body, the resistance from the outside world became much weaker.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body paused for a moment before he carefully looked once around him. When he did not discover anything, he finally let out a soft sigh in his heart. He flicked his finger and a wisp of invisible flame slowly curled and rose from his fingertip.</p>
 <p>The appearance of this wisp of flame suddenly caused the place to become hot and bright. After which, the flame shifted slightly before aiming at a deep region of magma. Finally, it actually began to swiftly fall without control.</p>
 <p>This sudden, unexpected change caused Xiao Yan to be slightly startled. His eyes changed before he clenched his fist, moved his body, and swiftly followed it. It seemed that the deep parts of the magma did have something that was summoning the Fallen Heart Flame. What caused Xiao Yan to feel doubtful, however, was the reason for him not having such a feeling when he captured the flame back then.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body turned into a jade-green fire figure that carried some doubt in its heart. He became like a fish entering the sea as he penetrated the viscous magma. An invisible flame was visible a couple of meters in front of him, acting like a guide…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knew very little about this magma sea. The only thing that he knew was that this place seemed to be the place where the Fallen Heart Flame was born. He was completely unaware about whether this magma sea possessed anything. Of course, it was likely that even First Elder Su Qian did not have much of an understanding regarding this magma field hidden under the Inner Academy. In the past, this place was the residence of the Fallen Heart Flame. The Inner Academy’s experts were thinking of all ways to seal the hole in order to avoid it breaking the seal and escaping. Hence, it was natural that no one would take the initiative to enter it. After Xiao Yan had subdued the Fallen Heart Flame, First Elder Su Qian had come down here once. However, after seeing this endless magma, he turned around and left with some fear.</p>
 <p>After all, he was not Xiao Yan. Although he possessed the strength of someone at the Dou Zong class, he still appeared exceptionally small when faced with this kind of underground magma world that had been formed by nature after a countless number of years. Hence, he could only stay his exploration mindset as he swiftly left… therefore, no one was able to give Xiao Yan any information regarding this magma world. He would have to rely on himself.</p>
 <p>The vast magma was bright-red. The swiftly descending jade-green fire figure within this bright-red magma world appeared to be exceptionally eye-catching.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face within the jade-green flame was tensed. His eyes were filled with a solemness. It had been nearly twenty minutes since he had begun his descent. However, the ball of Fallen Heart Flame in front of him still continued to descend. It did not show the slightest hint of stopping. This caused Xiao Yan to be afraid of feeling relaxed in his heart.</p>
 <p>Due to him descending deeper and deeper, the surrounding pressure had also become more and more frightening. If not for the help of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, it was definitely impossible for Xiao Yan to endure to this point with just his five star Dou Huang strength. Even though this was the case, the situation was still pessimistic. Maneuvering the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame also required quite a great amount of Dou Qi. The fire affinity energy within the magma might be extremely dense, but it was difficult for it to replenish this kind of exhaustion on a large scale. Although this might greatly slow down the Dou Qi exhaustion, it was only a matter of time before it was completely exhausted. Moreover, Xiao Yan still had to save sufficient Dou Qi to return to the surface…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced at the swiftly flying Fallen Heart Flame while numerous thoughts flashed through his heart. He involuntarily inhaled a gentle breath of air. This time around, he seemed to have been a little rash. If he was not careful in this kind of dangerous place, it was likely that he would meet the miserable fate of death.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan raised his head. All that entered his eyes was a crimson-red color. This kind of feeling, where everything around him was the same, would have likely caused Xiao Yan to lose his sense of direction a long time ago if he had not place a Spiritual Imprint on the Heavy Xuan Ruler before he entered the magma. If one lost one’s direction in this kind of magma world, he would undoubtedly end up dying…</p>
 <p>“Ugh…”</p>
 <p>A soft sigh was emitted as a faint thread of horror surged from deep within his heart. Something unknown was the most frightening. Faced with this endless magma world, even Xiao Yan, who possessed the Fallen Heart Flame, felt a kind of helplessness.</p>
 <p>The soft sound slowly sounded. Just when Xiao Yan had determined a final time limit in his heart, the swiftly flying Fallen Heart Flame gradually slowed down…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan braced his attention when he saw this scene. His heart became increasingly cautious as his eyes carefully weighed his surroundings.</p>
 <p>This place remained a bright-red world. It did not appear to be the end of the magma sea. This was because there was still dark-red magma under Xiao Yan’s feet. If one were to look carefully, one would faintly see a dark blackness within it that caused one to be afraid. It would never allow anyone to know just what thing existed at the end of it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s swept his gaze around and some doubt was involuntarily revealed within his eyes. Not the slightest bit of unusualness was present in this place. Could it be the unknown summoning was emitted from this place?</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan was in doubt, the cluster of Fallen Heart Flame in front of Xiao Yan floated slowly. After which, a faint fiery glow scattered down from it. This fire glow was like a lamp post that shone on the magma not far away. Immediately, a strange scene appeared. One could only see that the magma was actually wiggling. After which, a transparent light circle that emitted a faint glow surfaced from the magma swirl.</p>
 <p>This sudden change had caused the Dou Qi within Xiao Yan’s body to be maneuvered on top of causing him to be surprised. He had already decided that he would immediately turn around and flee if any sudden change occurred. A person who was able to create such a mysterious scene within the magma was definitely not someone whom he could contend with. Fleeing was the most rational choice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s anxious gaze studied the scene below as though he were facing a great enemy. The faint transparent light circle had completely appeared within the magma. Xiao Yan’s gaze had also swept over it at the first opportunity.</p>
 <p>Due to the light circle being transparent, it did not hinder Xiao Yan’s gaze. However, when his gaze swept over, it immediately caused Xiao Yan to be stunned. His eyes was filled with shock and disbelief.</p>
 <p>This was because there was nothing within the light circle other than a body that had long been turned into a skeleton. The size of the skeleton was massive. Due to it always being surrounded by magma, the bones were completely white and emitted a faint glow. The thing that caused Xiao Yan to be shocked was not the bones but a flame that was drifting on top of them. The flame was transparent, appearing much like an invisible item. One to two fire seedlings would occasionally leap out. The surrounding magma seemed to be extremely afraid of it. Once the fire seedling expanded and shrank, a circular whiteness formed around the bones. Other people might feel that this thing was somewhat foreign, but Xiao Yan was unusually familiar with it. That was because this flame was the Fallen Heart Flame!</p>
 <p>Moreover, Xiao Yan could tell from a glance that the transparent flame within the light circle was not some Heart Flame. Instead, it was a genuine Fallen Heart Flame. In other words, the thing that had appeared in front of Xiao Yan was actually another Fallen Heart Flame?</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xiao Yan’s mind involuntarily felt giddy. How could the same place possess two of the same ‘Heavenly Flame?’ Moreover, who did that mysterious skeleton belonged to?</p>
 <p>Various mysteries surged in Xiao Yan’s head, causing it to become a cluster of paste. Just when he was at a loss, all of the goosebumps on his body suddenly stood on end because… a hot wind was shooting toward him in a strange manner!</p>
 <p>There was actually another person present in this magma world that was void of any life?</p>
 <p>At this instant, even the skin on Xiao Yan’s head involuntarily became numb.</p>
