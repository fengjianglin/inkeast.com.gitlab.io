 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1640: Origin Qi</u></strong></p>
 <p>Heavenly Tomb.</p>
 <p>A huge square floated in the sky while a hundred thousand feet large stone statue stood on it. A faint pressure enveloped the entire Heavenly Tomb, causing the many spiritual bodies within it to feel a horror that originated from within their souls.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stood on the square. His eyes looked at the incomparably large Ancient God stone statue in front of him. He inhaled a deep breath of air before respectfully bowing towards the stone statue. After which, his body slowly rose into the air. Finally, he paused at the hole on the chest of the stone statue.</p>
 <p>The surface of the hole was filled with a water ripple like faint luster. This light might appear weak but Xiao Yan did not dare to slight it. This was because this seemingly weak light had easily pressed experts like Gu Yuan and Zhu Kun onto their knees earlier.</p>
 <p>Little Yi had also flashed and appeared on Xiao Yan’s shoulder at this moment. Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame surged and wrapped around his body.</p>
 <p>“Success or defeat will be determined by this…” Xiao Yan muttered. A determined expression rose on his face as he stepped forward and directly strided into the stone hole.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan penetrated through the weak light. He could clearly sense a kind of probing sweeping past the surface of his body. Everything within his body, including even his soul, could not escape from this inspection.</p>
 <p>This feeling was as though all of his secret had been exposed at this moment.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan was being carefully scanned, it was fortunate that the light did not display any rejection against XiaoYan. Suddenly, Xiao Yan’s eyes became dazzled. A giddy feeling was emitted from within his mind.</p>
 <p>This giddiness lasted for a moment. After Xiao Yan finally recovered, he suddenly discovered that the surrounding environment had undergone a drastic change.</p>
 <p>Brilliant flames filled his eyes. Undoubtedly, this was a sea of fire. Moreover, the sea of fire was extremely colourful. It was so bright that it caused one to be amazed.</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Flame sea huh…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan lowered his body. His hand gently grabbed at a purple flame, which had appeared. A familiar feeling rose into his heart as he involuntarily muttered, “Three Thousand Burning Flame…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan opened his stride and walked into this sea of fire, where many different Heavenly Flames had gathered. While he walked, these flames began to cluster around him. Their manner was as though they had great affinity with him.</p>
 <p>“It seems that your constitution is greatly welcomed by the Heavenly Flames…” Xiao Yan was slowly walking when an elderly voice, which contained some laughter suddenly resounded over this sea of fire.</p>
 <p>This sudden voice caused Xiao Yan to be slightly startled. He hurriedly lifted his head and looked at a sea of fire a short distance away. Flames had gathered on that spot. It turned into a huge flame bud that slowly bloomed. An elderly figure in deep coloured robe appeared in Xiao Yan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>The elderly figure was wearing a deep coloured robe. His expression did not reveal any uniqueness. If one was to ignore his multi-coloured bright hair, he would appear little different from those ordinary elders.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the old man was seated within a flower bud. His elderly face wore an unknown smile as he stared at Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan had already seen this figure many times. However, those whom he had met were either an illusory figure or a fake. This time around, however, Xiao Yan understood in his heart that this was the true Tou She Ancient God!</p>
 <p>Perhaps this might merely be a remanent shadow or a soul fragment but regardless of what the case was, this person was the legendary last elite Dou Di on the Dou Qi continent!</p>
 <p>“This junior Xiao Yan greets elder Ancient God.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan suppressed the shock within his heart. He respectfully gave the old man seated in the flower bud a bow of someone from the younger generation.</p>
 <p>“It seems that the mansion that I have left behind has been opened…” Tou She Ancient God smiled faintly. He waved his hand and the sea of flame in front of him rose to form a fire flower bud. “Sit.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not put up any act upon hearing this. His body flashed and he sat down in that fire flower bud. Xiao Yan felt emotions surging in his heart now that he was observing this legendary person at such a close proximity. Only at this moment did he realise that the brilliant long hair of the Tou She Ancient God actually had faint fire seedlings rising from it. Immediately, he came to a comprehension. Zhu Kun had mentioned that the Tou She Ancient God was a Heavenly Flame to begin with. He had only evolved after devouring the other twenty-one types of Heavenly Flames on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. Subsequently, he trained for an extremely long period of time before reaching the Dou Di class.</p>
 <p>After Xiao Yan roughly glance at the number of colours on those long hair, he discovered that there were coincidentally twenty-one of them.</p>
 <p>“Has there been any new Dou Di appearing on the current Dou Qi continent?” The Tou She Ancient God looked at Xiao Yan as he smilingly inquired.</p>
 <p>“Elder is the last elite Dou Di on the Dou Qi continent until now. No elite DouDi had appeared after you.” Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before replying.</p>
 <p>“As expected…” The Tou She Ancient God was not overly surprised at this reply. Instead, he nodded gently.</p>
 <p>“Is elder aware of the reason for this? I have once heard my ancestor say that the current Dou Qi continent seems to have a missing mysterious energy as compared to the ancient times.” Xiao Yan could not resist his curiosity as he asked.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, your ancestor is rather capable. He is actually able to discover this.” The Tou She Ancient God was a little startled upon hearing this. He laughed, “This is indeed the case. With the flow of time, the current Dou Qi continent had begun to lack something. This is the critical factor in advancing to the Dou Di class. Otherwise, regardless of how outstanding one’s talent is, one could only stop before the sky.”</p>
 <p>“What is missing?” Xiao Yan frowned and softly asked.</p>
 <p>“Origin.” The Tou She Ancient God gently uttered a seemingly deep and unfathomable word.</p>
 <p>“Origin?”</p>
 <p>“During the ancient times, some experts refer to this thing as Origin Qi. This is a mysterious energy that was formed with the world. Only after absorbing the Origin Qi will one be able to successfully breakthrough the barrier to the Dou Di class.” The Tou She Ancient God nodded slightly and replied. “Every plane would have some Origin Qi being formed when it was created. However, Origin Qi cannot be created again. In other words, every Origin Qi exhausted would led to it being diminished in this world.”</p>
 <p>“Elite Dou Di is an existence that surpass this world. The birth of every Dou Di would greatly exhaust quite a lot of Origin Qi. In the face of this expenditure without replenishment, it would eventually reach a point where nothing remain. This is the reason why the Dou Qi continent no longer produces any Dou Di. This is because the current Dou Qi continent no longer has any Origin Qi…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly. This was indeed the case of the predecessors enjoying and the descendants suffering. The so called Origin Qi had been completely exhausted by the ancient people. This had resulted in some problems that had to be bore by the subsequent generation.</p>
 <p>“Someone has already obtained the Di tier embryonic pill that elder has left behind. Currently, that person is engaging in a massacre and forcefully extracting energy in order to complete that Di tier embryonic pill.” Xiao Yan laughed bitterly before refocusing on the main topic. No matter what had happened in the past, the thing that he needed to consider now was how to advance into the Dou Di class and stop Hun Tiandi.</p>
 <p>“the Di tier embryonic pill contain a trace of Origin Qi. If that person is really able to complete the final step, it would not be impossible for him to advance into the Dou Di class.” The Tou She Ancient God laughed. He immediately looked at Xiao Yan and said, “I am aware of your motive in coming here.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was grave. He cupped his hands together and said, “I hope that elser will aid me. This could bf considered a great calamity of the Dou Qi continent.”</p>
 <p>“I am not really interested about whether there is a calamity or otherwise. You should perhaps be aware of my identity…” The Tou She Ancient God laughed. “ However, since you are able to come to this place, you are naturally the most suitable person to inherit my inheritance. If you can</p>
 <p>“Elder, thank you for your favor.” Xiao Yan rejoiced.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha.” Tou She Ancient God smiled and waved his hand. He suddenly beckoned Xiao Yan. A cluster of pink flame immediately rose from within the latter’s body. Finally, it turned into a fire baby as it appeared in the former’s hand. It was Little Yi.</p>
 <p>“Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, it has been a long time since we have met…” The Tou She Ancient God looked at Little Yi in his hand. He laughed softly and said.</p>
 <p>Little Yi’s small face contained an iciness and hatred as it stared at the Tou She Ancient God. However, it did not say anything. There was a lost expression flashing over its small face. From the looks of it, it appeared to be unable to clearly remember the distant past. The only thing that it knew was that his feelings towards this person in its heart was a mixture of fear and complicated emotions.</p>
 <p>“It looks like you still hate me greatly…”</p>
 <p>Tuo She Ancient God was unconcerned about the emotion in Little Yi’s eyes. He turned his eyes towards Xiao Yan and said, “There is a feeling that I am familiar with in your body. If I guess correctly, you should have practiced a mysterious Qi Method that can devour Heavenly Flames, right?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled. Immediately, he understood that it was impossible to keep any secret in front of this person’s eyes. Subsequently, he nodded quietly.</p>
 <p>“That Qi Method is not bad. Back then, I only managed to achieve my future success because of it.” Tou She Ancient God laughed.</p>
 <p>“Elder is actually the creator of the Flame Mantra?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was slightly altered. It was unexpected that the mysterious Qi Method was actually created by Tou She Ancient God. However, this did make sense. Only such a person could create this mysterious Qi Method.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, you have guessed wrongly. The Flame Mantra that you spoke of is not created by me. When my soul and intelligence was formed back then, I had coincidentally found this Qi Method in my lost state. This had resulted in me undergoing some changes. Come to think of it, this Qi Method had been of a great help to me. I am also quite curious about its creator. However, I have never met him.” Tou She Ancient God laughed.</p>
 <p>“It is really difficult when pondering one’s fate. Perhaps the both of us could be barely considered to be from the same sect.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan widened his mouth. His heart was extremely shaken. It was unexpected that the Flame Mantra actually had such a relation to the Tou She Ancient God. However, he was unaware of just what kind of outstanding person the creator of this unbelievable Qi Method was to create it.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, it has been many years since I have talked to someone. I have spoken a lot of unnecessary things today.”</p>
 <p>The Tou She Ancient God flicked his finger gently. The endless brilliant sea of fire suddenly shook. Finally, a fire dragon surged and agglomerated into a fist sized brilliant lotus. Many fire seedling rose on the surface of the lotus.</p>
 <p>“My inheritance is in this place. Whether you can reach the Dou Di class depends on your own fate.”</p>
