 <p><strong><u>Chapter 974: Self Destruction of an Elite Dou Zong</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s feet moved as he looked at the swelling Chen Yun, who was swiftly pouncing over. His body quickly rushed into the air. At the same time, his palms were opened and a thread of silver-colored spatial strength flashed and appeared.</p>
 <p>“Spatial Seal!”</p>
 <p>The space around Chen Yun suddenly fluctuated intensely as the soft cry sounded. It suddenly stirred an intense ripple and the invisible space immediately seemed to have become substance-like, transforming into a spatial prison that wrapped around Chen Yun!</p>
 <p>Even an ordinary five star Dou Zong would have difficulty agglomerating such a substance-like spatial prison. However, Xiao Yan was able to create it after borrowing the strength of Tian Huo zun-zhe. Of course, the most important reason for this was that his body already possessed a thread of spatial strength. He used it as a medium in order to maneuver the spatial strength flowing in nature.</p>
 <p>The spatial prison had just been formed when Chen Yun’s body suddenly swelled to a frightening extent. Immediately, a soul-stirring explosion suddenly appeared!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A frightening energy wave wildly swept in all directions like a tidal wave. The spatial prison resisted it a little before it burst apart. The entire mountain range shook intensely, appearing as though an earthquake had occurred. Numerous thousand-foot-large cracks spread out like spider web. The entire mountain range had descended into a panic at this moment. The strength involved when a four star Dou Zong self-destructed was extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan merely managed to temporarily dodge the attack of this frightening energy storm. His body flashed and appeared in the distant sky. His eyes revealed a solemness as he looked at the rampant energy wave. After this action by Chen Yun, this entire mountain range would likely turn into ruins.</p>
 <p>Hong Tian Xiao, who was fleeing the mountain range, also sensed this frightening energy storm. His expression changed almost instantly.</p>
 <p>“That old fellow Chen Yun actually self-destructed… by being able to force him until such an extent, that brat… is really too frightening.” Hong Tian Xiao suddenly felt a little bitterness in his mouth. If he knew that this brat would be so troublesome to deal with from the start, he would definitely not have made enemies with him. Possessing such an enemy really caused him to have difficulty eating and sleeping in ease.</p>
 <p>However, this world did not have any medicine for regret. This was something that Hong Tian Xiao was also clearly aware of. Moreover, he was not an indecisive person. A fierce glow immediately flashed across his eyes as he muttered to himself, “This brat is indeed extremely strange. However, by killing Chen Yun, you will not be able to feel nice. The Wind Lightning Pavilion will not sit back and watch an Elder be killed. At that time… hee hee.”</p>
 <p>With a sinister smile, Hong Tian Xiao decisively turned his head and waved his hand. His fleeing speed once again increased.</p>
 <p>.........</p>
 <p>The white-clothed, old man at a certain spot in the mountain range was also shocked by Chen Yun’s crazy act. He hurriedly pulled Han Xue as his body penetrated the mountain forest in a lightning-like manner. Finally, his figure flashed and landed on a mountain peak. He looked down at the rampant energy storm in the mountain range from high above and involuntarily inhaled a breath of cool air.</p>
 <p>“This old fellow is really crazy…”</p>
 <p>Han Xue was similarly shocked by the destructive energy below until her pretty face turned somewhat pale. The self-destruction of a Dou Zong was not something that just anyone would be able to personally witness.</p>
 <p>“By being able to force a Dou Zong to take the dead end path of self-destruction, this young man called Xiao Yan is indeed extremely terrifying…” The white-clothed, old man slowly raised his head, looked at the blurry figure in the sky, and spoke in a somewhat hushed manner.</p>
 <p>“Is he alright?” Han Xue’s eyes also swept over the sky. Her eyesight was far inferior to the white-clothed, old man. Naturally, she was unable to see Xiao Yan’s figure.</p>
 <p>“What can happen to him. That spatial seal had eliminated Chen Yun’s intentions of dying with him.” The white-clothed, old man shook his head before immediately saying, “However, since he has killed Chen Yun, it is likely that he has truly become enemies with the Wind Lightning Pavilion. That Hong Tian Xiao will definitely announce the news to everyone when he gets back. Given the style of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, they will definitely dispatch experts to kill Xiao Yan.”</p>
 <p>Han Xue’s hand involuntarily clenched upon hearing this. Her face revealed a worried expression.</p>
 <p>“Alright, girl, there is no need to be overly worried. This little fellow is not an ordinary person. He kills decisively and does not possess a weak character. With such a character and his strength, it is likely that he will be able to do extremely well even in the Central Plains, where all sorts of experts hide. It is likely going to be quite difficult to kill him.” The white-clothed, old man smiled as he reassured her. His words held Xiao Yan in high regard.</p>
 <p>Han Xue nodded slightly. Her hand pulled aside the black hair on her forehead while her bright eyes revealed sentimental thought as she looked to the sky. Her elder sister was right. This person was really too outstanding. He was so outstanding that very few women could hold onto him…</p>
 <p>.........</p>
 <p>The energy storm raged brutally within the mountain range. It continued for over ten minutes before it gradually weakened. During this period of time, Xiao Yan’s figure continued to remain in the sky. His eyes were also gradually shut.</p>
 <p>A whistling wild wind blew over the mountain range, carrying some dust with it. At this moment, the originally lush green forest had completely turned into a muddy color.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan in the sky finally opened his eyes when the last wisp of energy storm slowly disappeared. His gaze slowly swept over the mountain range below, which had become extremely chaotic. Finally, he gently landed and his footsteps slowly walked to the spot where Chen Yun had self-destructed earlier. An enormous pit that was a couple of hundred feet in size had appeared at that spot. The black darkness was such that one could not see the bottom at a glance.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze swept over the pit. His footsteps suddenly turned and he arrived at a spot near the enormous pit. There was a swaying withered tree located at that spot.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand slowly rubbed the withered tree while a cold smile was suddenly lifted onto the corner of his mouth. His palm was violently thrown forward and the withered tree burst apart. Wooden chips flew and an illusionary spirit fled from it in panic. It flew toward the the sky. However, it had just moved when the surrounding space suddenly solidified.</p>
 <p>“Elder Chen is really quite scheming. Allowing your body to self-destruct while a thread of your soul fled. Unfortunately…” Xiao Yan smiled, looked at the illusionary spirit, and softly spoke.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, don’t kill me. We can sit down and talk properly. You don’t wish to offend the Wind Lightning Pavilion in this manner, do you?” The spirit had just been trapped when it immediately transformed into Chen Yun’s illusionary face. At this moment, his eyes contained a genuine fear. If this thread of soul were destroyed by Xiao Yan, he would truly be finished.</p>
 <p>“I don’t wish to reach such a stage too. However, all of this is because you have forced me…” Xiao Yan softly sighed. He extended his hand and immediately grabbed Chen Yun’s soul.</p>
 <p>“Little bastard, the Wind Lightning Pavilion will not let you off. Just wait for your death!” Chen Yun cursed viciously upon sensing Xiao Yan’s killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was expressionless. He tightened his hand and Chen Yun’s soul suddenly exploded. It immediately transformed into light spots before disappearing.</p>
 <p>Looking at the scattering spiritual light spots, Xiao Yan knew that this Elder of the Wind Lightning Pavilion had gave his last farewell to this world.</p>
 <p>..........</p>
 <p>“He is careful and does not leave any room for his enemy to escape. This fellow is not an ordinary person…”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed, old man suddenly sighed and spoke while standing on the mountain top.</p>
 <p>Han Xue stood uncertainly by his side and blinked her eyes. She did not witness the scene where Xiao Yan destroyed Chen Yun’s soul. However, she felt that her great-grandfather, who possessed impossible expectations, seemed to give Xiao Yan a very high evaluation.</p>
 <p>“Old sir has praised me too much. I am merely unwilling to allow some trouble to follow me again…”</p>
 <p>A faint laugh suddenly sounded on the mountain top. Immediately, Xiao Yan’s figure slowly appeared in front of the white-clothed, old man.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan.”</p>
 <p>Han Xue immediately cried out joyfully upon seeing Xiao Yan appear.</p>
 <p>The white-clothed, old man also smiled. However, his feet had shifted forward by half a step without leaving a trace, vaguely blocking Han Xue behind him as he did so. He had personally witnessed Xiao Yan kill Chen Yun. It was likely that this matter would bring about quite a lot of trouble for Xiao Yan if it were to spread. After seeing Xiao Yan’s vicious tactics earlier, the white-clothed, old man did not treat Xiao Yan as a kind person.</p>
 <p>“Old sir need not be so cautious. Xiao Yan is not a bloodthirsty person. Moreover, I owe Miss Xue-er my gratitude. Repaying kindness with revenge is not something that I can do.” Xiao Yan softly laughed. Although the actions of the white-clothed, old man were extremely small, it did not escape Xiao Yan in his current condition.</p>
 <p>The white-clothed, old man felt somewhat embarrassed upon hearing this. He cupped his hand together and said, “The old me is Han Fei.”</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan greets old mister Han.” Xiao Yan cupped his hands together and replied with a grin.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, the old me is unworthy of such a big greeting.” Han Fei waved his hands before solemnly saying, “We will not say anything about the matter today. However, it is likely that Hong Tian Xiao will make it public. At that time, you will need to be careful of the Wind Lightning Pavilion.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your warning, old mister Han.” Xiao Yan nodded. It was not that he did not wish to chase after Hong Tian Xiao. However, he was unable to maintain this condition for long. Once Tian Huo zun-zhe withdraw the Spiritual Strength, it was likely that Xiao Yan’s would experience a weary phase because of the overly powerful energy. How could he kill Hong Tian Xiao in that state?</p>
 <p>“Since young friend Xiao Yan is aware of it, the old me shall not say anything more. I will bid you goodbye today. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will come and seek some advice from young friend.” Han Fei beamed. His gaze swept around him and knew that this was not a place that one should stay for long. Finally, he cupped his hands and spoke.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>“You… you should be careful.” Han Xue bit her lower red lip with the back of her teeth and whispered when she saw that they were about to leave.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan grinned and said, “You should also take care.”</p>
 <p>Han Fei by the side laughed bitterly in his heart upon seeing this situation. He pulled Han Xue along as his figure moved and rushed toward a distant mountain range.</p>
 <p>“Be careful of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. It is best for you to leave the northern region of the Central Plains as soon as possible…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at Han Fei and Han Xue who had disappeared into the distance when a faint gentle voice drifted over with the wind.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan exhaled a gentle breath. His eyes watched the two figures as they disappeared into the horizon. He also turned his body and flew to another side of the mountain range. The current him needed to quickly raise his strength. It was time to consume that Mighty Huang Pill. However, he was unaware how much this medicinal pill would raise his strength...</p>
