 <p><strong><u>Chapter 491: Breaking Through Once Again</u></strong></p>
 <p>The students who had the qualifications to enter the fourth level of the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ to train could basically be considered the top among the Inner Academy. Being unworthy of this level, the current Xiao Yan did not act so mightily like he did in the third level. Hence, after he entered the fourth level, he first settled the most important matter of filling his belly before choosing a middle grade training room to continue his important task of his retreat.</p>
 <p>Although the effect of training in the middle grade training room on the fourth level could not compare with that of a high grade one, if one was to compare the degree of power of the Heart Flame, it was much stronger than that obtained by training in the high grade training room on the third level. From the perspective of the current Xiao Yan, it was just suitable. His training would also not be frequently interrupted because of people trying to snatch a high grade training room.</p>
 <p>After finding an empty training room, Xiao Yan once again took out the medicinal cauldron and refined some ‘Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment’ and ‘Swift Wind Spirit Pill.’ During the seven days of retreat, he had exhausted all of the pills from the last refinement. Therefore, he needed to once again open his cauldron and refine them.</p>
 <p>With the refinement experience from the last round, Xiao Yan’s refinement this time around naturally appeared even more skillful. Thus, the time which he used was greatly reduced. Moreover, the quality and quantity that he refined was clearly better than his first attempt.</p>
 <p>After Xiao Yan successfully refined the two types of medicinal pills that he needed, he began his retreat. His great breakthrough plan would continue without bothering about anything else.</p>
 <p>This time around, Xiao Yan’s retreat was not interrupted midway through, perhaps due to some other factors. This also gave him his most favorable training time.</p>
 <p>There was no concept of time when training. With a flick of a finger, nearly half a month passed by. During this reclusive retreat, Xiao Yan would occasionally leave the training room but around ninety-five percent of his time was spent within the training room, persevering to breakthrough the eight star barrier.</p>
 <p>Under this kind of training where he forgot to eat and sleep, Xiao Yan, who had already reached the peak of the seven star Da Dou Shi class, had finally vaguely touched the eight star boundary after half a month. Now, after two to three days of training, the Dou Qi in his body finally reached a stage where it was completely full. It was like a tank that was filled to capacity with water. At this moment, the Dou Qi in Xiao Yan’s body was like water which was about to overflow. As long as one added a little more, it would break the bounds of the water tank and enter into an even larger world.</p>
 <p>This little opportunity finally came suddenly during one of Xiao Yan’s training where he was slightly unconscious...</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s upper body was naked within the quiet training room. He sat cross-legged on the black stone platform. Both of his hands formed the training seals. His face was like an old monk meditating, appearing calm and indifferent. The threads of powerful energy visible to the naked eye were pouring unceasingly into his body due to the effect of the ‘Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment’ that was spread all over.</p>
 <p>The quiet atmosphere continued for an unknown period of time. Suddenly, an extremely slight but strange, low sound appeared like a drum being heavily pounded beside one’s ears. If one were to carefully listen to it, this sound was actually being emitted from Xiao Yan’s body!</p>
 <p>Not long after the appearance of this strange low sound, Xiao Yan’s wooden pillar like unmoving body appeared to have received an electric shock. It trembled abruptly and an unusual sleek redness immediately swarmed up onto his face. Of course, the change was not only restricted to this little bit on the outside. An extremely great change appeared to also be happening in his body. The most obvious one was the suction force in his body which had suddenly rose explosively.</p>
 <p>Under this incomparably powerful suction force, the dark-red, hot energy threads lingering around his body that was originally entering his body in a successive manner had become like a herd of wild bulls that was in a panic state at this moment. They no longer cared even a little about order as they wildly swarmed into Xiao Yan!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body had once again turned into a bottomless pit at this moment. It received all the energy that came, regardless how large the energy that swarmed over was. Moreover, there was no signs of this momentum being reduced. Instead, the suction force became increasingly stronger. Finally, it resulted in the energy in the training room to appear like the surface of a calm lake after one had thrown a large rock into it. The energy fluctuated and an extremely large energy ripple with Xiao Yan at the middle was suddenly formed. A powerful suction force stirred all of the energy that filled the training room.</p>
 <p>The unusual phenomenon within the training room continued for nearly over ten minutes before the clear explosive sound of bone slowly became weaker...</p>
 <p>After the appearance of the somewhat strange bone explosive sound, the enormous energy ripple within the training room became increasingly weaker. A moment later, it finally completely disappeared… Following this disappearance of the energy ripple, the human figure that was seated cross-legged was once again revealed.</p>
 <p>The black robe on the body of the current Xiao Yan had been shaken by the wildly pouring energy earlier until it was in tatters. The ‘Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment’ that was applied all over his skin had also been vaporized and depleted. Other than the seven-colored small snake hiding and sleeping on his arm, the other remaining part of his body, which was still skinny, did not have much change compared to earlier.</p>
 <p>The green-colored flame soared strangely from within Xiao Yan’s tightly shut eyes as they were slowly opened. Finally, it shrouded over his dark-black pupils. It was awhile later before it gradually disappeared.</p>
 <p>The flame was withdrawn. The pair of dark-black pupils were somewhat darker, deeper, and more profound compared to earlier. A long turbid breath moved along his throat and was exhaled. This breath actually contained a little black vapor.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan immediately knit his eyebrows tightly upon seeing the black vapor in his breath. His heart only recalled something which he had nearly forgotten, the ‘Searing Poison.’ It was that mutated ‘Searing Poison’ that had been hiding deep within his body and was difficult to cure just like maggots within one’s tarsal bones.</p>
 <p>“It is really unexpected that I have only managed to remove this little bit of ‘Searing Poison’ by borrowing the strength of breaking through… this damn thing. It really causes one’s entire body to feel uncomfortable by concealing itself in one’s body.” Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and shook his head. Although the ‘Searing Poison’ currently did not appear to display any harm to his body because of the protection of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ that his body enjoyed, this thing was ultimately a thorn in Xiao Yan’s heart each day that it was not removed. After all, he had personally witnessed its strength. Even Nalan Jie, with his Dou Wang class strength, had nearly lost his life because of this thing. There was no need to even mention him, who was a seven star, no, an eight star Da Dou Shi now.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed gently as he temporarily put down the worry over the ‘Searing Poison’ that he had in his heart. He slowly stood up and twisted his body. Immediately, a clear bone cracking sound, like that of a firecracker being lit, appeared within the training room.</p>
 <p>As the cracking sound appeared, a relaxed and full feeling seeped out from within Xiao Yan’s bones. After a twenty plus days retreat, he had finally broke through to an eight star Da Dou Shi as he had hoped. Such a fruitful result was worthy of his twenty plus days of reclusive and tough training!</p>
 <p>“Already eight star. Looks like my distance to the Dou Ling class… is not far…” Xiao Yan smiled. He lowered his head to eye the ‘Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python’ on his arm which carried an icy-cold temperature and could not help but say with a bitter smile, “This fellow is really becoming increasingly greedy for more sleep these days. It was not even woken up after such an large activity…”</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan was scolding with a smile on his mouth, his heart sunk greatly. This kind of long-term slumber of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ was clearly irrational. According to common sense, the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python,’ which was in its growing period, should be extremely lively. However, it was current drowsy all day and was not even the least bit alert… Xiao Yan had a faint inkling on what kind of abnormality this meant. Immediately, he could not help but become a little worried.</p>
 <p>“Looks like the spirit of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ has already begun to be pressured by that of Queen Medusa… According to this situation, I’m afraid that in less than a year, Queen Medusa will successfully occupy the body of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’. At that time, her spirit and the body will merge. She will also truly become an absolute strong Dou Zong… Dammit, from the looks of the viciousness of that woman, the first thing she will do after she gains control of the body will be to point a blade at me…” Xiao Yan’s hand rubbed the somewhat icy-cold body of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’. His brows were knit until they formed a straight line as he slowly muttered.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured that she will not attack you before she obtains the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill.’ How is it so easy for the spirit and the physical body to perfectly merge? She must borrow the help of the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ to first swallow the spirit of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python.’ Only after that can she merge with the body of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python.’ Otherwise, she will not be able to achieve total control. The body of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ would only become a burden to her.” An old laugh suddenly sounded from within Xiao Yan’s heart, comforting his uneasy heart.</p>
 <p>“Teacher!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face rejoiced upon hearing the voice in his heart. Only after hearing Yao Lao’s words did he let out a heavy sigh of relief. He smiled and nodded as he spoke in his heart, “It will be for the best if it is like this. As long as she still requires the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill,’ I will have the chips to discuss conditions with her. It will naturally be for the best if I can rope in an elite Dou Zong.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Queen Medusa who broke through the limits of a Dou Huang will have limitless potential in the future. Back then, a Medusa evolved and appeared on the Dou Qi continent once. However, her actual body was not the ‘Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python’ but another ancient ferocious beast: ‘Seven Wings Purple Golden Snake.’ Although it is a little weaker than the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python,’ three elite Dou Zun were eventually mobilized in order to exterminate her back then.” Yao Lao laughed. His voice contained a feeling of cherishment.</p>
 <p>“Three Dou Zuns?”</p>
 <p>TL: For those who cannot remember, Dou Zun the next level after Dou Zong. Refer to wiki</p>
 <p>The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth parted. This title that contained an immense pressure caused Xiao Yan to not know what to say. He was black for a long while before his gaze turned toward the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ on his arm. He laughed bitterly and muttered, “Is this ‘grandaunt’ going to be that powerful in the future? Won’t I be unlucky? Ah… ‘Heaven Swallowing Python,’ you must hang on. Do not get swallowed by that woman. Otherwise none of us will have a good time…”</p>
 <p>TL: grandaunt - refers to a female who is great and difficult to deal with</p>
 <p>As Xiao Yan thought about the partially visible cold and indifferent killing intent that Queen Medusa would always display toward him, a cold shiver violently occurred in Xiao Yan’s heart. Being eyed by this kind of frightening woman really could not be considered good news...</p>
