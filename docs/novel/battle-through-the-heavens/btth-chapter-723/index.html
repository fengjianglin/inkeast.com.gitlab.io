 <p><strong><u>Chapter 723: Pain</u></strong></p>
 <p>A slight tremble suddenly appeared in the black curtain that spread over the sky. A moment later, a couple of black lines were quietly spread out. The glaring sunlight immediately scattered in and expelled all the darkness within this area…</p>
 <p>The black curtain swiftly disappeared and everyone on the open ground used their hands to cover the sunlight that had suddenly scattered down. A moment later, they finally raised their heads and looked at the distant sky.</p>
 <p>Protector Wu stood in the air. His hand was dragging a cluster of black fog at this moment. There was a somewhat familiar fluctuation being emitted from the black fog.</p>
 <p>Protector Wu’s hand seal changed as his hand grabbed the cluster of black fog tightly. After which, it was swiftly sucked into a ring on his finger. He immediately heaved a long sigh of relief. He had finally captured this old fellow who had escaped for so many years. The hall’s chief would be happy when he returned this time around.</p>
 <p>Protector Wu glanced at Medusa who was rushing over after trapping Yao Lao’s spirit into the storage ring. He merely laughed coldly as his body trembled slightly. After which, he turned into a black fog that rushed over to Xiao Yan who was standing still on the treetop in a ghost-like manner.</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, brat, your teacher has already been captured. You should also go and accompany him!” Protector Wu escaped from being chased by Medusa in the blink of an eye, and shot directly to Xiao Yan while laughing in a dark, cold manner.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan lowered his head and stood on the treetop in a dull fashion. He appeared to have not sensed Protector Wu’s attack and his body was completely still.</p>
 <p>The expressions of Hai Bodong and the others by the side changed drastically when they saw Protector Wu rushing over once again. He hurriedly pulled Xiao Yan in an attempt to dodge. However, at this moment, the latter’s body appeared to have been nailed to the treetop. It was momentarily difficult to move him.</p>
 <p>Protector Wu suddenly rushed over during the instant when the few of them hesitated. Seeing this situation, Medusa who had hurried over from behind was clearly not in time to rescue him.</p>
 <p>“Bring him away!” A lovely little figure suddenly appeared in front just as Hai Bodong and the others once again prepared to fight head on against Protector Wu. Purple-colored long hair drifted with the wind. It was surprisingly little Zi Yan who seldom fought. However, at this very moment, the small face of this little girl was covered with a solemn expression.</p>
 <p>Hai Bodong was startled when he saw Zi Yan’s action. He immediately clenched his teeth and nodded. His hand used some strength and forcefully dragged the dull Xiao Yan as he quickly withdrew.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, you are seeking death!”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu stared angrily when he saw that Zi Yan actually dared to come forward and block him. He immediately let out a furious cry and waved his hand. A surging black fog erupted.</p>
 <p>Those gem-like eyes stared intently at the black fog that came rushing over. An unusual purple glow slowly filled both of Zi Yan’s eyes. She clenched her small fists, and the purple glow covered both of her arms before solidifying into a strange purple-colored crystal layer on her fist. After which, it contained a frightening force that could shatter a mountain and crack a stone as it was ruthlessly thrown out.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A low, deep sound appeared and the couple of layers of black fog that gathered around Protector Wu actually fluctuated. It immediately disappeared. It was unexpected that Zi Yan’s strength was actually able to block a blow from Protector Wu, who was an elite Dou Zong!</p>
 <p>Of course, it seemed that using this kind of frightening strength placed an extremely large burden on Zi Yan. Hence, following this punch, the purple glow in her eyes immediately became weary. Even her aura had become much weaker.</p>
 <p>“Huh?” That Protector Wu also let out a surprised cry when he saw that Zi Yan had actually blocked an attack by him. However, before he could attack once again, a colorful glow suddenly rushed down from the sky. Medusa’s pretty, ice-cold face appeared in front of Zi Yan. She clenched her delicate hand and a seven colored snake-shaped longsword suddenly pierced forward, targeting Protector Wu’s throat.</p>
 <p>Protector Wu did not dare to easily slight Medusa’s attack. His ghost-like claw-hand was extended out and it immediately slammed in a strange manner as it swiftly collided with the seven colored snake sword, carrying the sound of metal colliding as it did so.</p>
 <p>Clang! Clang! The loud sound caused eardrums to feel a piercing pain.</p>
 <p>“Medusa, do you really want to become enemies with our ‘Hall of Souls’?” Protector Wu cried out furiously after being repeatedly blocked by Medusa. He had already delayed things for quite long. Just capturing Yao Lao had already caused him to spend a great amount of effort. The spike in energy due to the usage of the Secret Technique had also began to show signs of discontinuing. If this went on, it was likely that he would meet his end in Medusa’s hands.</p>
 <p>Medusa’s expression was cold as her sword pierced toward Protector Wu’s fatal spot. Without leaving a trace, her pupils glanced at the dull looking Xiao Yan who appeared to have lost his soul. Some fury also quietly surged from deep within her pupils. Her attack also became sharper and more vicious.</p>
 <p>“Hand over the spirit!”</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, you can continue dreaming…” Protector Wu laughed in a strange manner. He dodged the snake like sword and his eyes looked at the distant Xiao Yan somewhat pitifully. He laughed in a sinister manner, “Brat, consider yourself lucky today. However, our ‘Hall of Souls’ has quite a lot of interest in your Xiao clan. The next time, this protector will get you to accompany your teacher. Let’s stop today.”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu’s body flashed and began to flee after his cold laughter sounded.</p>
 <p>“Bastard, hand over my teacher’s spirit!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, who was in a dull state, immediately recovered when Protector Wu’s laughter sounded. His eyes instantly became crimson as he let out a furious roar. A pair of jade-green fire wings flashed and appeared on his back. Both of the wings were flapped as he wildly shot toward the former. While he was flying, the jade-green flame suddenly surfaced in both hands and quickly began to merge.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan was currently seriously injured, he was unconcerned about anything in the face of the blow from Yao Lao being captured.</p>
 <p>Instead of being angry, Protector Wu rejoiced when he saw that Xiao Yan actually dared to attack. This fellow was basically allowing himself to be caught!</p>
 <p>Medusa’s figure flashed and moved just as Protector Wu waited for Xiao Yan to come and look for him. She appeared in front of the crimson-eyed Xiao Yan and grabbed him. She talked to him in a deep voice, “Don’t act recklessly. You need to be a little calmer if you do not wish for your teacher to be disappointed in you. There will no longer be anyone who can rescue him if you are caught!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan only quietly recovered some reasoning after hearing Medusa’s voice. He rubbed the somewhat warm fire seal on his forehead and clenched his teeth tightly. The jade-green flame that was on both of his hands slowly became much fainter.</p>
 <p>Protector Wu immediately shook his head in disappointment upon seeing Medusa intervene. He coldly smiled and said, “Indeed, brat, your teacher is not an ordinary spiritual body. Even the hall’s chief holds him in high regard and will not do anything to him within a short period of time. Hence, come. Come to the ‘Hall of Souls’ to save him. This Protector awaits you.”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu also ceased to remain any longer after his cold laughter sounded. His body flashed and transformed into a black fog before rushing to the horizon in a lightning-like manner. He swiftly disappeared. That speed was something that even Medusa had difficulty catching up with.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes stared intently at Protector Wu who had disappeared. A moment later, he suddenly grabbed his head and let out a roar. His roar was filled with pain and sadness.</p>
 <p>Medusa softly sighed as she looked at the tear-filled crimson eyes of Xiao Yan. That pretty face which was usually indifferent suddenly became much gentler. Her delicate hand patted Xiao Yan’s head as she softly said, “You will need to train hard if you wish to rescue your teacher. He has placed all his hope in you. Do not disappoint him… moreover, it is not as though you are alone any longer. The Xiao clan needs to rely on you if it is to revitalize within the Jia Ma Empire!”</p>
 <p>Hai Bodong, Jia Xing Tian, and the others became silent as they looked at Xiao Yan, who was crying out painfully like a wounded wild beast in the sky. The great strength of Protecter Wu had exceeded everyone’s expectations. It was unexpected that even someone of Yao Lao’s caliber would end up with such a fate…</p>
 <p>Yun Yun and Nalan Yanran were also startled as they looked at the pain that was revealed on the young man’s face from the air above the open ground. They had only seen this usually rational young man display such an emotion twice during these years. The first time was when his father was missing and the second time was today…</p>
 <p>“Teacher, what do we do now? He… he killed grand-teacher Yun Shan. We…” Nalan Yanran looked at the mess of the open ground. When her gaze swept over the corpses of those Elders, her eyes revealed a shocked expression. This Misty Cloud Sect was truly destroyed.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Yun Yun had already told Nalan Yanran in detail about what had happened within the Misty Cloud Sect. Of course, she naturally did not conceal the death of Yun Shan. Hence, at this moment, Nalan Yanran also knew that the main culprit for the Misty Cloud Sect turning into this state was Xiao Yan in the sky.</p>
 <p>Yun Yun tightly clenched her hand. Her face was also filled with a struggling expression. She clearly understood that this time around, Xiao Yan had come seeking revenge. The acts that the Misty Cloud Sect committed against the Xiao clan made it such that there was no chance of reconciliation. What she did not tell Nalan Yanran was that it was likely that today’s matter was not over. Now that the old man who seemed to have quite a deep relationship with Xiao Yan was captured, it was likely that Xiao Yan’s fury would be completely turned against the Misty Cloud Sect. After all, that mysterious Protector Wu was some helper that Yun Shan had found from some unknown place.</p>
 <p>If one looked at it this way, both of Xiao Yan’s closest people were directly or indirectly destroyed by the Misty Cloud Sect. Even Yun Yun knew that there was no possibility that the feud between both parties could be reconciled.</p>
 <p>Hence, it is likely that the Misty Cloud Sect would no longer exist within the Jia Ma Empire in the future…</p>
 <p>The corner of Yun Yun’s mouth had a bitterness as this thought rotated swiftly within her heart. She did not expect that things would actually develop until this stage. Moreover, she also possessed a responsibility that she had difficulty shedding in all of this. If she had not quietly promised to allow Nalan Yanran to go and cancel the engagement back then, it was likely that none of these matters would exist. Xiao Yan and the Misty Cloud Sect would all be in one piece and they might even be related by marriage…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan in the sky finally began to gradually quiet down as time slowly flowed by. He gently pushed Medusa aside before using his cold crimson eyes to sweep over the open ground of the Misty Cloud Sect below, Yun Yun and Nalan Yanran...</p>
