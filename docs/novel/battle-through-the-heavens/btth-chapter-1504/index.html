 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1504: Blood Coloured Giant Axe</u></strong></p>
 <p>Cream-white flames filled one’s eyes within this spacious hall. Many fire human figures stood straight-backed in this nearly ten-thousand-foot-large square hall. They did not emit any sounds, but an extremely terrifying aura saturated the hall. That aura merged together and transformed into a large fire dragon that lingered over the heads of these fire human figures. There was a killing intent surging from it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group studied the formation in this hall from a corner. Xiao Yan’s brows were involuntarily knit. This was not the first time he had seen such a situation. Ever since they had entered that large door, Xiao Yan’s group had charged through three halls similar to this, but the further they progressed, the fire slaves they faced became stronger!</p>
 <p>Based on the senses of Xiao Yan’s group, every single one of these fire slaves in front of them possessed a Dou Zun strength.</p>
 <p>One Dou Zun was not worth mentioning in the eyes of Xiao Yan’s group, but when this number increased to ten thousand, even an elite Dou Sheng would have to brace their attention, especially when these fire slaves cooperated with each other perfectly. Their combined strength was extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>“Elder Gu, when will we reach the end if we continue charging on like this?” Xiao Yan frowned and involuntarily asked. Even though their group was quite strong, the Dou Qi within their bodies would be exhausted sooner or later if they continued charging through these endless halls. The natural energy within this realm was mixed with the demon flame. No one dared to simply absorb it. Even an elite Dou Sheng would not be able to endure if one’s exhaustion was greater than one’s intake.</p>
 <p>“We have no other choice. The demonic flame realm has become an extremely dangerous place after being managed by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame for thousands of years. Otherwise, others would not have failed to capture it during these thousands of years.” Gu Nanhai shook his head and replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s frown deepened upon hearing this reply, but he also felt helpless. This demonic flame realm was far too strange. After charging to the next place, the previous place would strangely disappear. It seemed was as though there was a large invisible hand quietly removing the places behind them, forcing them to head forward.</p>
 <p>“Did those ancestors from your clan also break through all these obstacles when they had come to this place in the past?” Xiao Yan asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>“Is the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame stronger a thousand years ago or is it stronger now?” Xiao Yan’s eyes flashed as he asked.</p>
 <p>“Ugh… although the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame a thousand years ago was not captured by anyone, it still suffered a serious injury, but one thousand years is more than enough time for it to fully recover. Moreover, from the looks of the Nightmare Heavenly Fog, the current Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is stronger.” Gu Nanhai hesitated for a moment before responding.</p>
 <p>“So it’s like this…” Xiao Yan lifted his head and looked at the dome above the large hall. His eyes slightly flickered, “It seems like this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is planning to play with us like dolls…”</p>
 <p>Everyone knit their brows after hearing these words. Being played with by a Heavenly Flame was really something that was difficult to accept.</p>
 <p>“Let’s continue to walk!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment. After which, he gently waved his hand. His voice had regained its cool.</p>
 <p>Everyone was startled upon hearing this command. They quickly nodded as their bodies moved and attacked at the same time. The group easily crushed the fire slave army in the hall in an instant. After which, all of them turned into light figures that appeared at the end of the hall in a couple of flashes. After which, they destroyed another large door and entered it.</p>
 <p>They continued this bitter attempt to overcome the obstacles during this subsequent period of time, but the tasks were extremely monotonous. Each large hall had the same fire slaves. The only difference was that the strength of the fire slaves increased the further they ventured. In the last clash, even Ancestor Huo Yun had suffered some minor injuries while fighting the fire slave army. Although the rest were slightly better, their expressions had gradually become grave. Their continuous charges was little different than having clashed with many elite Dou Shengs, causing them feel exhausted.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The enormous door of the hall was shattered by the expressionless Xiao Yan with a palm strike. Another large hall appeared as the stone fragments shot out. Everyone felt a weariness in their hearts the moment they saw the large hall. They did not know how long it would take for these various obstacles to come to an end.</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over the large hall. However, he quickly emitted a ‘huh’ sound because he discovered that this large hall was not packed with fire slaves.</p>
 <p>“Have we passed through all the obstacles?” Xun Er also discovered the change.</p>
 <p>“No…” Gu Nanhai shook his head. His eyes were locked on something in the middle of the large hall. There was a somewhat skinny figure standing at that spot. Strangely enough, no flame lingered around his body. Both of his eyes were tightly shut as a mountain-like aura spread from his body!</p>
 <p>“Four star Dou Sheng!”</p>
 <p>Gu Nanhai’s and Zi Yan’s bodies gently trembled at this moment. A grave expression slowly surged onto their faces. Although the two of them were also four star Dou Shengs, that skinny figure in the hall was still a little stronger than them!</p>
 <p>“Is this also a fire slave?” Xiao Yan asked in disbelief. Just how terrifying was this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame? It was able to turn a four star Dou Sheng into a fire slave?</p>
 <p>“He can barely be considered a fire slave since he possesses an intelligence that belongs to him. Compared To those fire slave that are controlled by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, he possesses his own autonomy.” Gu Nanhai spoke with a grave expression. “Looks like this is the final hurdle. We should be able to reach the location of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame once we pass through this!”</p>
 <p>“This won’t be easy.” Xiao Yan frowned as he remarked. Even with their lineup, it would not be easy to defeat a four star Dou Sheng.</p>
 <p>“There is no way to retreat now that we have come here.” Zi Yan spread her hands as she spoke to Xiao Yan. After which, her pretty eyes looked to Gu Nanhai as she spoke in a somewhat lazy tone, “The two of us should attack together and finish him off as soon as possible. I am completely irritated…”</p>
 <p>“Aye.” Gu Nanhai did not reject her suggestion. He understood that it would be difficult for him alone to deal with this skinny man.</p>
 <p>“Pay attention to the surroundings…” Xiao Yan gently waved his hand as everyone quietly rushed into the hall. They separated and surrounded the skinny human figure. Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai landed in front of that man.</p>
 <p>That human figure’s tightly shut eyes slowly opened when everyone landed within the large hall. A pair of dark-black eyes that were void of emotion were revealed, but they clearly contained an additional liveliness compared to the fire slave they had met earlier. Nevertheless, those eyes were still icy-cold…</p>
 <p>Both of his eyes merely stared at Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai in front of him. Neither parties spoke, but the atmosphere had become more tense.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan only managed to get a good look at this skinny human figure after approaching him. The skinny figure was wearing ordinary clothes, and his face seemed to be completely stiff. There was no discernible expression on his face. Both of his eyes were cold and indifferent, appearing like ice that had not melted in ten thousand years.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The ground of the quiet hall suddenly trembled as the skinny figure gently clenched the empty space in front of him. A strange ten-foot-large blood-red axe appeared out of nowhere. This skinny figure appeared a little comical beneath the outline of that giant axe. The people present could clearly sense the terrifying energy the skinny figure hid.</p>
 <p>“This person is really powerful…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was grave. He would never have imagined that such an expert could be controlled by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.</p>
 <p>Gu Nanhai frowned as he looked at the giant blood-colored axe. It seemed as though he was thinking of something.</p>
 <p>Both parties did not say anything unnecessary after the blood-colored axe appeared. Three pairs of eyes glanced at each other. Wild wind suddenly blew as three figures brutally collided together. The earth-shaking ripple that erupted caused Xiao Yan’s group to hurriedly pull back…</p>
 <p>“Clang clang!”</p>
 <p>The three figures in the large hall flashed with dazzling speeds. Sparks continued to shoot out as the three figures flashed and appeared. The unusually strong hall began to crack an inch at a time. Many crack lines began to spread.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group had already withdrawn by a great distance. They were in no position to interfere as the three elite Dou Shengs exchanged blows. Just the remnant ripples caused them to feel awed.</p>
 <p>Even with Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai’s combined attacks, that skinny figure holding the large blood axe did not give in. The large axe danced like the wind as a bloody scent spread across the hall. Although he was powerful, Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai were not ordinary people either. Yhe skinny figure gradually fell into a disadvantage as the fight continued. However, his occasional retaliation still caused Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai to appear a little miserable. If it was a one on one fight, these two individuals would be no match for this mysterious person.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The three figures suddenly made contact in the middle of the large hall. A frightening sound swept apart like a huge wave. The figure with the blood axe staggered and flew backwards. His feet stomped against the ground of the large hall, forming over a dozen deep pits.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>That skinny figure’s indifferent eyes suddenly revealed a crazy heat after being forced back. A low roar was emitted from his throat as a powerful light suddenly shot out of his brow. A symbol slowly appeared in front of everyone’s eyes as the skinny person’s aura suddenly soared.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes immediately paused on this strange symbol. After which, he seemed to have been struck by lightning as his face became dull.</p>
 <p>“This… this is… Xiao clan’s clan tattoo?”</p>
 <p>The symbol that appeared on the person with the blood axe was the unique clan tattoo of the Xiao clan!</p>
 <p>Why did this person possess the Xiao clan’s clan tattoo?</p>
