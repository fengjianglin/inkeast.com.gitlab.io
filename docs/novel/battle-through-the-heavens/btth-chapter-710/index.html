 <p><strong><u>Chapter 710: Decisive Fight With Yun Shan!</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gradually became cold and quiet after hearing Yun Shan’s cold words that were filled with killing intent. Powerful jade-green Dou Qi curled and rose from his body like a flame and immediately encased his entire within.</p>
 <p>Skyfire Three Mysterious Change. He had not used this ever since Xiao Yan had come out from under the grounds of the Jia Nan Academy. Currently, the ‘Heavenly Flame’ within his body was merged from the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ and the ‘Fallen Heart Flame.’ The strength this Secret Technique could procure was entirely dependent on the strength of the ‘Heavenly Flame’. Hence, now that Xiao Yan had once again used it, the strength that it increased to was naturally much greater than when he used it back then.</p>
 <p>Back when Xiao Yan was within the Dou Ling class, he was able to rely on this Secret Technique to fight with Liu Qing, Lin Xiuya, and other people at the peak of the Dou Ling class or even those expert Dou Wangs. Hence, after he had used the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, the strength on his surface was no longer inferior to that of a four or five star elite Dou Huang. Adding this to the uniqueness of the ‘Flame Mantra’ as well as his physical body which was refined by many spiritual medicines, the strength that his powerful Dou Qi could unleash was sufficient to contend with someone at the peak of the Dou Huang class!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan flicked his finger and an enormous Heavy Xuan Ruler surfaced in his palm. The heavy weight caused Xiao Yan’s hand to sink slightly before he swiftly recovered. After having so many years of getting used to it, the weight of the Heavy Xuan Ruler did not pose much of an obstacle to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Although the suppression of the Heavy Xuan Ruler on the circulation of Dou Qi within his body would cause someone’s fighting strength to be reduced slightly, this drawback had already been reduced until it almost had no effect after so many years of getting used to it. Hence, it naturally did not have much of an impact on Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not split his attention by even a little after hearing the intense energy explosion that was transmitted from the distant sky. His gaze blinked as it locked onto Yun Shan in front of him. His feet curled slightly and became just like a fierce hunting lion, where his shaking muscles hid an explosive strength.</p>
 <p>Yun Shan smiled as he looked at Xiao Yan’s cautious manner as though he was faced with a powerful enemy. His sleeves shook and the soft cloth he wore had gained a hardness that was not inferior to steel after Dou Qi was poured into it. If one’s strength had reached the level of a Dou Zong, almost every portion of one’s body, including even a strand of hair, would be able to become a sharp killing weapon.</p>
 <p>“Come, allow this ancestor to take a look and see just what kind of support you have to actually dare to return once again.” The deep-green energy in his palm rotated swiftly in a swirl as Yun Shan laughed in a dense, cold voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face was expressionless, and he did not say a single word. A dense bright silver glow swiftly appeared on his feet. His body trembled slightly…</p>
 <p>Yun Shan narrowed his eyes and looked at the unmoving Xiao Yan on the opposite side. The finger under his sleeves moved, and with a cold laughter, he suddenly waved his sleeves. Immediately, it carried a terrifyingly sharp wind that viciously hacked through a certain part of the air.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A hard steel-like sleeve cut through the air. Just before it reached a certain part of the air, it fluctuated suddenly and a black figure strangely appeared. The heavy ruler carried a ferocious strength and unceremoniously smashed violently against the sleeve. The two made contact in mid-air and a thunder-like muffled sound immediately resounded across the land. Ripple-like force swiftly spread out and the air vibrated slightly as it spread.</p>
 <p>Yun Shan’s arm trembled when the two collided as it shed all the force it received. That black figure, however, repeatedly took a couple of steps back before it stabilized and revealed itself. That person was surprisingly Xiao Yan who was supposed to be on the other side.</p>
 <p>“Your speed is indeed fast but that is merely only useful against an expert Dou Huang. Against me…” Yun Shan looked at Xiao Yan who had clenched his five fingers tightly before at his back. The afterimage that Xiao Yan had left behind in that place had scattered until only a faint image was left. Yun Shan could not help but shake his head and laugh coldly.</p>
 <p>“Is that so? What about this?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced indifferently at this old man who was quite arrogant. A low snort was emitted from his throat before his hand seal suddenly changed. A purple-black glow immediately appeared on his back. A pair of substance-like purple-black wings appeared once again.</p>
 <p>This pair of purple-black wings followed the jade-fire wings as they extended out. That manner was as though the fire wings were wrapped by a layer of black wings.</p>
 <p>This pair of purple-black wings was naturally the Purple Cloud Wings that Xiao Yan had not used for a long time. Ever since he had advanced to the Dou Wang class, the flying speed of the wings that were formed from Dou Qi had far exceeded that of the Purple Cloud Wings. Hence, he had not used this kind of flying Dou Technique for a long time. However, this did not mean that it had lost its use. Being able to be called an extremely rare Dou Technique on the continent, it naturally did not only have such little ability. Its other effect was the reason that caused its value to multiply.</p>
 <p>The effect was superimposition!</p>
 <p>The so-called superimposition was just as its name suggested. It was to overlap two different things together. This was the case for the flying Dou Technique. Once one’s strength had reached the Dou Wang class, one would be able to superimpose the two kinds of wings together. The speed that this kind of superimposition could produce naturally far exceeded that of an ordinary pair of Dou Qi wings. The only disadvantage was that it consumed quite a lot of Dou Qi. Otherwise, if it was used to cover distances quickly, that speed would truly allow one to feel what was called chasing the stars and the moon…</p>
 <p>The superimposition of the wings was similar to the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change in that it was also displayed by Xiao Yan for the first time after his strength had soared. However, the shock that this kind of superimposition brought could be somewhat seen from the surprise that appeared on Yun Shan’s face.</p>
 <p>One could unceremoniously say that with the superimposition of the wings and a Di Class Low Level agility Technique like the Three Thousand Lightning Movement, Xiao Yan’s speed would once again soar to a new level. This kind of speed was something that even someone of Yun Shan’s ability would not dare to easily underestimate!</p>
 <p>After the superimposition of the wings, the pair of Dou Qi wings on Xiao Yan’s back had turned from jade-green to a blackish-green color. The wings were flapped and numerous rays of light lingered on them. Although it was a little less beautiful compared to the earlier jade-green fire wings, the deep, restrained color caused one to not dare to underestimate it.</p>
 <p>The blackish-green wings were flapped slowly and a substance-like wind lingered over Xiao Yan’s entire body before scattering with a whistle.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan only smiled after sensing that his body had suddenly become much lighter than before. He looked at the gradually weakening smile on Yun Shan’s face and said, “Old dog Yun Shan, do you still dare to say that it is useless now?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not give the slightest amount of time for Yun Shan to reply after saying those words. The wings on his back were flapped abruptly and he immediately disappeared amid the faint sound of rolling-thunder. He was surprisingly above Yun Shan’s head the next time he appeared.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan held the heavy ruler tightly with both hands. He let out a stern cry and the heavy ruler gained a mountain-breaking momentum as it cut through the sky and hacked down toward Yun Shan’s head.</p>
 <p>This attack by Xiao Yan was void of any fancy moves. All it possessed was a surging strength. Under the pressure of this strength, all the air that was half a meter below the ruler was suppressed until it scattered in all directions, resulting in a vacuum area forming as the heavy ruler swung down!</p>
 <p>“Your speed is still alright but this strength is really insufficient!” Yun Shan coldly laughed as he looked at the heavy ruler that was swiftly expanding in his eyes. He clenched his fist tightly and immediately gave Xiao Yan a punch across the air!</p>
 <p>When his punch was thrown forward, an arc immediately surfaced in the air in front of him. An invisible air cannonball swiftly took shape before it finally carried a sharp sound that resounded through the air. It suddenly shot forward and collided with Xiao Yan’s heavy ruler.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The heavy ruler was around half a meter from Yun Shan’s head when it collided with the invisible cannonball. The rebound force that was transmitted to the heavy ruler shook it until it repeatedly trembled. If Xiao Yan’s strength had not been similarly quite great, it was likely that this attack would have already thrown the heavy ruler out of his hand!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body trembled, and completely resolve the force that was being transmitted from the ruler. Xiao Yan did not withdraw even a little. The wings on his back were flapped as he transformed into a black line and entered Yan Shun’s side. At the same time, he suddenly tightened his right hand and his arm shook in a strange manner. A powerful force swiftly agglomerated on his fist. An instant later, it smashed toward Yun Shan’s chest in a Techniqueful manner.</p>
 <p>“Octane Blast!”</p>
 <p>A low, deep voice was transmitted from Xiao Yan’s mouth. The wind on his fist suddenly soared and the frightening strength was something that caused even someone of Yun Shan’s ability to raise his eyebrows slightly.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan’s speed was extremely fast. Yun Shan, being an elite Dou Zong, was naturally not weak. At such an urgent time, his feet violently stomped down and the sea-like surging Dou Qi within his body immediately surged in front of his body. In the blink of an eye, it agglomerated and formed a deep-green viscous energy liquid on his body.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s fist carried a frightening force as it violently smashed against the viscous energy liquid. The two collided and merely emitted a slight sound. The frightening strength on Xiao Yan’s fist swiftly scattered as though it was swallowed completely.</p>
 <p>“You already used this move three years ago…” Yun Shan laughed coldly when he saw the surprise that flashed across Xiao Yan’s face.</p>
 <p>“This similar move can also cause you to feel uncomfortable!” Xiao Yan also laughed coldly. His arm suddenly twisted and a bone cracking sound was swiftly emitted. His fist violently trembled!</p>
 <p>A hidden force swiftly surged out like an undercurrent as the fist shook. It immediately passed through the viscous liquid like defense and exploded like a bomb on Yun Shan’s clothes…</p>
 <p>Yun Shan’s expression gradually became dark and cold as his body firmly received the hidden force of the attack by Xiao Yan. His chest shrank and it beat suddenly. A majestic force erupted out from all directions and the first one it struck was Xiao Yan who was the closest to him!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s footsteps landed in the empty air and the wings on his back also flapped. It was a long while later before he shed the force away. A muffled feeling was also transmitted from Xiao Yan’s chest.</p>
 <p>Yun Shan’s gaze was dark and cold as he looked at Xiao Yan who was swiftly withdrawing. He slowly lowered his head and looked at the tattered robes at his chest area. The torn robe revealed his chest where a bright-red fist mark was imprinted on it at this moment. Clearly, it was left behind by Xiao Yan earlier.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, good. Very good. You are the first person who has left behind a fist mark on my body ever since I advanced to the Dou Zong class…” Yun Shan’s face completely turned dark and cold as he looked at the fist mark. A killing intent that caused a person’s heart to feel cold gradually spread out from his body.</p>
 <p>“Since you are able to reach this stage, this ancestor shall allow you to see what is an elite Dou Zong!”</p>
