 <p><strong><u>Chapter 713: Submerged Wind Braking Blades</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The black-colored chain was just like a poisonous snake as it suddenly penetrated the air and transformed into a blurry black line that shot explosively toward Yao Lao a short distance away.</p>
 <p>The tip of the chain was unusually sharp and filled with a mysterious rune. Circles of spiraling lines covered the tip of the chain. Under the energy activation of Protector Wu, some evil aura seeped out from it. This deep, profound chain was not an ordinary metal chain.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao also did not dare to slight this chain that pierced through the sky toward him. This ‘Hall of Souls’ was extremely mysterious. Their attacks also appeared to be able to cause massive damage toward spiritual bodies. However, it was fortunate that Yao Lao was not an ordinary spiritual body. With the protection of the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’, he was not totally without any ability to fight back against the powerful hunter of the ‘Hall of Souls’.</p>
 <p>The dense white flame in his palm withered up and down before suddenly transforming into a fire arrow that shot out explosively. Finally, it violently collided with that black chain.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A low, deep sound appeared when the two collided. However, there was no overly intense energy explosion sound. There was only a dense white ripple force that was formed within the dark-black circle quietly expanding out. The air also shook a little wherever the force spread.</p>
 <p>The black-colored chain collided with the fire arrow. There was a huge gap in strength compared with the attack that Protector Wu had expected. He could even faintly feel the strange intertwining feeling of hot and cold with one another. That feeling was swiftly transmitted from the chain, causing the Dou Qi in his body to fluctuate.</p>
 <p>“No wonder you were able to escape the capture of the ‘Hall of Souls’ back then. You actually relied on the strength of this ‘Heavenly Flame’!” The chain withdrew after it attacked before it lingered around Protector Wu’s side. The pair of red eyes stared at Yao Chen opposite of him and spoke with some surprise.</p>
 <p>The strength that an ordinary spiritual body could unleash was greatly reduced regardless of how strong their spiritual strength was when they met a hunter from the ‘Hall of Souls’. The latter’s weapon was uniquely manufactured and possessed the specialized effect of restraining a spiritual body. This kind of restraint, however, had lost much of its effect when faced with a spiritual body that possessed a ‘Heavenly Flame’ and some natural spirit objects.</p>
 <p>It was just as he had said. Back then, Yao Lao had indeed relied on the strength of the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ in order to escape being captured by the ‘Hall of Souls’ and survive.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s gaze looked indifferently at Protector Wu, who had black fog writhing around his body. He tightened his hand a little and the dense white flame swiftly agglomerated in his hand. A moment later, it formed a white ruler that was a little smaller than Xiao Yan’s Heavy Xuan Ruler. A flame rose on the ruler but it gave people a kind of ice-cold feeling. However, if one were to really come into contact with what seemed like a cold flame, it was likely that one would instantly transform into a pile of ashes.</p>
 <p>“The restraining effect your ‘Hall of Souls’ has toward a spiritual body does not have much use against me. Hence, you should reveal your true strength. Otherwise, the Misty Cloud Sect will be the place that you will die today.” Yao Lao pointed the white ruler at Protector Wu from a distance and slowly spoke.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, your words are indeed arrogant. Even without the restraining effect, you are actually thinking of killing this protector in your spiritual body state? Aren’t you dreaming?” Protector Wu also laughed coldly when he heard this. His arm immediately shook and three black figures carried a ‘clang’ sound as they extended forcefully from his back. Finally, they became just like three poisonous snakes that continuously lingered over his head.</p>
 <p>“Triple Soul Breaking Chain!”</p>
 <p>A hand that contained a black fog was extended out. The hand seal immediately changed and the three chains that lingered over Protector Wu’s head carried the whizzing sound of rushing wind as they abruptly shot out.</p>
 <p>The three chains transformed into black lines and coincidentally sealed off all of Yao Lao’s retreat path as they crossed each other. Clearly, this Protector Wu had already reached a skillful stage when it came to using a strange weapon like a chain.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao waved his sleeves as he coldly looked at the three black lines which were magnified in his eyes. He flicked his five fingers and five dense white flames swiftly agglomerated and took shape. They lingered over his body like long snakes before finally shooting out in a sudden explosive manner and collided head-on with the three chains.</p>
 <p>Clang! Clang!</p>
 <p>The chains collided with the dense white flame and waves of metal-like sounds were emitted. Some sparks even shot out. However, regardless of how strange and unexpected the chain attacks were, the five long fire snakes that Yao Lao commanded were able to hold them ofg. Yao Lao’s sophisticated fighting experience was indeed extraordinary.</p>
 <p>Protector Wu clearly felt extremely surprise after failing to achieve any actual effect despite using this tactic. He could clearly sense that there would be a cold and hot intersecting feeling spread along the chain each time the chain and the flame collided. He was really unfamiliar with this kind of feeling.</p>
 <p>“This old man who will not die is indeed powerful. No wonder the ‘Hall of Souls’ allowed him to escape despite having dispatched three expert protectors back then. In the past, I thought that there were some lies in those fellow’s words. It is unexpected… that he is really tormenting and troublesome.” Protector Wu’s heart also grew increasingly more serious as both parties attacks became more intense. The strength of Yao Lao’s spirit and the troublesome ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ had far exceeded his expectations.</p>
 <p>“Yun Shan, quickly finish Xiao Yan off!” That unusual temperature caused the black fog on Protector Wu’s body to fluctuate after he violently collided with Yao Lao again. At this moment, he no longer cared about his face and cried out to Yun Shan who had begun an intense fight with Xiao Yan far away.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s expression also sank when he heard Protector Wu’s cry. The dense white flame on his body grew even more dense. His attacks also suddenly became sharper. Looking at the situation, there was some difficulty if Yao Lao wanted to kill the latter within a short period of time. After all, despite the restraining effects of Protector Wu on spiritual bodies being reduced to the minimum with the help of the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’, this fellow was also a Dou Zong class expert no matter how one put it. Killing him was easier said than done.</p>
 <p>Yun Shan in the distant sky was also slightly startled when he heard Protector Wu’s cry. That old fellow was actually this strong? Even Protector Wu had difficulty finishing him off?</p>
 <p>The surprise in his heart continued for a moment before Yun Shan suddenly waved his sleeve. A wild, violent Dou Qi shook Xiao Yan who was attacking him away. His body immediately moved back while a majestic Dou Qi suddenly erupted out from his body in all directions.</p>
 <p>“Little bastard. Originally, I wanted to play around with you. However, from the looks of it now, the situation does not allow me to do so. Since that is the case, I shall finish you off with one attack. Yun Shan gave Xiao Yan a dense smile as he shook his sleeves. A majestic deep-green energy immediately fluctuated as it erupted from his head. It swiftly wiggled and formed a green longsword that was over a feet long.</p>
 <p>The surface of the longsword was unusually dark and gloomy. Its entire body was without luster. However, the moment the longsword agglomerated and formed, the surrounding suddenly fluctuated. Clearly, this longsword that was completely agglomerated from Yun Shan’s powerful Dou Qi possessed an extremely great amount of energy.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at the huge energy longsword that was rotating while it suspended above Yun Shan’s head. He sensed the frightening energy that was contained within it, and his face changed drastically. The wings on his back were flapped as he immediately withdrew some distance. The seal on his hand also suddenly changed as he did so.</p>
 <p>The powerful Dou Qi within his body began to swiftly gallop following the swift seal formation within Xiao Yan’s hand. Finally, it quickly passed through a couple of specific veins under Xiao Yan’s solemn focus…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s essence and attention were gathered to extreme levels under the pressure of such a crucial point. The little troubles that would occasionally appear when he agglomerated Dou Qi during his usual training had become unusually smooth at this moment.</p>
 <p>The Dou Qi in his body flowed unceasingly as they poured into the couple of specific veins before flowing into Xiao Yan’s palms. Following the flow of such enormous amounts of Dou Qi into it, his pair of originally long arms transformed into something large at this moment. A bright powerful glow gradually surfaced. In the end, it appeared just like a bright sun that was extremely glaring.</p>
 <p>The powerful glow that suddenly erupted from Xiao Yan’s palm also caused Yun Shan to knit his brows slightly. Why was it that this little bastard had a never-ending number of trump cards? It was really troublesome… a thought rotated within his heart before he immediately glanced at the battleground between Protector Wu and Yao Lao in the distant. His heart became even more surprise especially when he saw that the former had actually ended up in a disadvantageous position under Yao Lao’s sharp attacks.</p>
 <p>“Looks like I cannot delay any longer. I need to hurry up and finish off this little fellow. Otherwise, if the old fellow is allowed to free his hands, things would be bad for me…”</p>
 <p>A thought flashed across Yun Shan’s heart as his eyes suddenly turned stern. The seal on both of his hands changed abruptly, and a low cry that was filled with a chill killing intent resounded across the sky.</p>
 <p>“Submerged Wind Braking Blades!”</p>
 <p>An unusual sharp sword whistle suddenly sounded after the cry appeared. Everyone suddenly raised their heads only to see that the Dou Qi longsword above Yun Shan’s head actually began to rotate wildly. An unusual sharp whistle was emitted from it.</p>
 <p>“Hah! Hah!” The sound continued…</p>
 <p>Yun Shan’s hand seal changed and his finger pointed toward Xiao Yan in the distance. That violently rotating longsword immediately rushed out explosively!</p>
 <p>The speed of the longsword was so fast that could even penetrate through the barrier of the air. Hence, it appeared at a spot that was merely dozens of meters from Xiao Yan within a few flickers.</p>
 <p>The faces of Hai Bodong and the others within the chaotic battleground instantly turned a lot paler when they saw this frighteningly powerful attack by Yun Shan. Despite being such a great distance apart, they could still sense the frightening energy that was contained within the longsword. If they were to be struck by it, they understood that they would at least end up being seriously injured.</p>
 <p>Yun Yun delicate hands also quietly covered her red lips as she stood near the wedding stage in the open ground. Her graceful, moving, pretty face displayed some paleness. This kind of attack was something that even an expert whose strength was at the peak of the Dou Huang class would have a difficult time receiving, much less the current Xiao Yan…</p>
 <p>However, the person involved, Xiao Yan, had suddenly shut his eyes slowly at this very moment in front of the countless number of gazes that contained various emotions. When he did so, the seal on his hand had suddenly changed. Immediately, a similarly majestic and powerful energy abruptly erupted in the sky!</p>
 <p>“Open Mountain Seal!”</p>
 <p>An energy handprint that was a few dozens of feet in size suddenly surfaced following the low, deep cry that resounded in Xiao Yan’s heart.</p>
 <p>The moment this energy handprint appeared, the air around Xiao Yann became like a ripple that swiftly fluctuated…</p>
