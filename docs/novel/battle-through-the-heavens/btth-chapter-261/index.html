 <p><strong><u>Chapter 261: The Huge Fight In the Sky</u></strong></p>
 <p>In the distant skyline, four imposing presences of the Dou Huang class spread across the sky. The surrounding space seemed to tremble slightly at this moment. The lazy white clouds in the blue sky were torn into pieces by the domineering forces in the sky.</p>
 <p>In Yan City, everyone repeatedly trembled under these four interacting vast and mighty forces. That terrifying pressure caused people to feel as though they were each carrying a five hundred kilograms heavy stone. Their breathing became somewhat deep and heavy.</p>
 <p>“Lu Man, ha ha, it’s unexpected that you would actually be forced into scurrying around randomly. If this was to be conveyed back, you would likely be ridiculed to death by them!” The enormous triangular shaped eyes stared at Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong opposite him. The huge mouth of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ opened and closed, emitting a deafeningly loud laughter.</p>
 <p>“You bastard Bai Ya. I am carrying someone with me and also don’t wish to wind up fighting them. If I don’t run, should I just foolishly stand there and wait for them to attack?” When the green clothed lady whose body was suspended beside the head of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ heard his mocking laughter, she could not help but yell furiously.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee.” The ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ smiled and shook his huge tail. His triangle shaped eyes moved. When he glanced at Qing Lin in the chest of the lady whom he addressed as Lu Man, his thunder like voice became much more serious. “Is it really the ‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’? “</p>
 <p>“Yes, there is nothing wrong with your senses. It really is that!” As she mentioned this, a joy was spread over the forehead of this green clothed lady while she smiled, nodded and replied.</p>
 <p>“That’s good…” Hearing this, the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ clearly sighed in relief. He once again shifted his gaze toward Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong opposite him. After scanning slightly, he exclaimed in shock. He paused on Xiao Yan’s body which was emitting a thick white flame and said with shock “How unusual. Why do I feel that the Qi on this person seems faintly familiar?”</p>
 <p>“You also had this kind of feeling?” The green clothed lady blinked her eyes in surprise. She sized-up Xiao Yan and said, “Just now, I exposed my cover because of the somewhat familiar Qi on his body. However, there are far too many strong people that I have come into contact with. Therefore, I cannot remember just who this Qi is similar to.”</p>
 <p>“The white colored flame on his body should be a ‘Heavenly Flame’, right? It is just that I am unsure which kind it is. Tsk tsk, what a lucky fellow.” The ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ said in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it indeed is a type of ‘Heavenly Flame’. His strength is extremely terrifying. My ‘Ten-Thousand Wooden Prison’ does not have any effect on him.” The green clothed lady nodded her head and said deeply.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, it has been many years since I came to the Jia Ma Empire. I did not expect that such a strong person had actually appeared.” The ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ was somewhat surprised as he said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Alright, enough of this nonsense. After creating such a huge commotion here, I’m afraid that the people from the Misty Cloud Sect and that old demon from the Jia Ma Empire royalty have already sensed something. If we were to drag on, it would be troublesome once they were to hurry over.” The green clothed lady said deeply.</p>
 <p>“Ok, I know. What a long-winded woman…”</p>
 <p>The ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ swung his enormous tail slightly and immediately said somewhat regretfully, “But how unfortunate. Originally, I wanted to find Queen Medusa to have a competition. Who would have thought that her evolution actually failed. Ah, such a beautiful woman. It was clear that she appeared just for this emperor.”</p>
 <p>“Bai Ya, stop having such romantic thoughts. Have you forgotten the terrible state that she beat you into the last time?” The green clothed lady rolled her eyes and helplessly said.</p>
 <p>“Hei, I love her violence.” The ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ shook his huge head and laughed loudly, “Alright. You should bring that girl and leave first. I will block them. Ten minutes later, we will meet at the old place.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, be careful. Those two are not simple people.” The green clothed lady nodded her head and reminded. The pair of wings on her back flapped gently and she shot to the distant skyline.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured. If we were to compare flying speed, there is no one in the Dou Huang class who can be compared with me.” The ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ waved his tail toward the green clothed lady in the distant and proudly laughed.</p>
 <p>“You want to go? Leaving her behind!” Seeing the green clothed lady quickly fleeing, Xiao Yan’s expression sank. He flapped his Purple Cloud Wings gently and his body shot forward.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, your opponent is me.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Xiao Yan who wanted to fly past him from above, the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ laughed. His eight wings flapped together and his huge body instantly appeared on the path that Xiao Yan was flying on. His huge serpent tail was suddenly swung. The terrifying force that it contained actually caused the space to have a sort of distorted feeling.</p>
 <p>Sensing the terrifying strength of the serpent tail, Xiao Yan’s expression changed. He did not dare to met it head on. His body swiftly twisted and dodged it. Although he dodged the attack, his aim of giving chase was stopped.</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Old Hai, attack!” Xiao Yan cursed softly. As his body avoided the repeated attacks of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’, he turned his head around and shouted toward Hai Bo Dong.</p>
 <p>“Help me block him for a moment!” Hai Bo Dong’s expression was serious as he cried out softly. His hand formed some seals. As his sleeves trembled slightly, cold air suddenly surged out of his body. In an instant, the entire place was completely shrouded by cold air. Due to the increased intensity of the cold air, threads of snow began to descend from the sky. A moment later, wild winds howled. The snow swiftly agglomerated into snow white ice blades. The threads of wild wind gradually turned into a vortex which suddenly expanded. A moment later, the vortex actually expanded until it was over ten meters wide.</p>
 <p>As the wild wind howled, numerous sharp ice blades were shot into the vortex. In an instant, a white colored tornado whose exterior was covered by sharp ice blades appeared out of thin air in the sky.</p>
 <p>By using his own strength to build such a ferocious ice blade storm, a lot of cold sweat began to accumulate on Hai Bo Dong’s forehead despite his strength.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, move aside!”</p>
 <p>Hai Bo Dong shouted in a low voice. When he saw Xiao Yan swiftly withdrawing to one side, Hai Bo Dong waved his sleeves. An enormous ice blade storm that carried a sharp breaking wind sound, howled as it swept toward the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’.</p>
 <p>“Hei, the momentum is quite good. However, I am a six star Dou Huang. How can this two star Dou Huang strength of yours compete with me? Ha ha!” Eyeing the ice blade storm that was being swept over, the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ laughed loudly. He swung his huge head and a black colored flame suddenly surged out of his body. After which, it was unceasingly being supplied out before finally agglomerating into an equally large black colored energy ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ on top of his head.</p>
 <p>Swinging his huge tail abruptly, the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ that was completely agglomerated from the strange black colored flame violently shot out from the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’. It carried a force that was quite terrifying and violently collided with the white colored ice blade tornado.</p>
 <p>At the moment of collision, the space when the two came into contact appeared to have shattered and opened tiny black colored crack lines.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Two different kinds of terrifying energy, with one being white and the other being black, stood off against each other for a moment before suddenly exploding in the sky. The intense energy explosion sound could still be faintly heard even a kilometer away.</p>
 <p>At the instance when the explosion occurred, a circle of energy ripples spread out from the point of explosion and shook both Hai Bo Dong and the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ at the same time, forcing them to pull back swiftly.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, with the way you squander, even if you are a Dou Huang, you could likely only display it a couple of times, no?” Eyeing Hai Bo Dong, whose face had some cold sweat surfacing, the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ laughed loudly.</p>
 <p>“Octane Blast!”</p>
 <p>Before his laughter completely fell, his huge triangular eyes abruptly shrunk. The dark black scales on his body abruptly and strangely tightened. A layer of faint black colored strange grease seeped out from below the scales and swiftly wrapped the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’s’ body within it.</p>
 <p>At the waist of the huge body of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’, Xiao Yan’s body suddenly appeared in a flash. His fist that was covered by a thick white flame that abruptly tightened and carried a terrifying force like a burst of lightning when it violently smashed downward. At this moment, that spacious black colored robe on Xiao Yan seemed to have become as tough as steel.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s fist smashed heavily onto the body of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor'. However, Xiao Yan’s expression became extremely ugly. This was because he had sensed that the body of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ had suddenly become as greasy as a loach.</p>
 <p>Even though Xiao Yan’s fist smashed onto the serpent, it moved along the layer of greasy film on the beast body and drifted away.</p>
 <p>Although most of the attack from this blow missed, there was still a small portion that was solidly smashed onto the body of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’. The high temperature contained in the thick white flame immediately caused the small section of serpent scale where the fist had landed to to curl up.</p>
 <p>“Hiss, it’s painful!” The intense pain that was transmitted from his body caused the huge body of the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ to abruptly curl up. The huge tail suddenly swung back and violently smashed on Xiao Yan’s back. Immediately, Xiao Yan became like a rubber ball as he was sent flying.</p>
 <p>“Glug…” The enormous force transmitted from his back caused Xiao Yan to spit out a mouthful of blood. His pair of wings flapped rapidly in order to stabilize his staggering body.</p>
 <p>“Ah, it is after all not a strength that belongs to me. It is extremely awkward controlling it.” Xiao Yan wiped off the bloodstain from the corner of his mouth and laughed bitterly in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?” Hai Bo Dong flew to Xiao Yan’s side and inquired.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine.” Xiao Yan shook his head. His gaze was somewhat anxious as he eyed the distant horizon. During this period of them that the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’ held them off, that green clothed lady had fled until one could not see her shadow.</p>
 <p>“What do we do? Although he cannot kill us, with his strength it does not seem difficult to hold us off.” Hai Bo Dong laughed bitterly, “The affinity of this fellow coincidentally restrains mine. The scales all over him have a defence that is frightening. Was it not for you relying on the ‘Heavenly Flame’ just now, that punch would likely have little effect on him.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth tightly, his breathing was a little hurried.</p>
 <p>“The both of us don’t possess those terrifying Dou Techniques with great destructive power. If we want to defeat him, it would seem a little difficult.” Hai Bo Dong sighed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan remained quiet. The ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ was something that belonged to Yao Lao. Therefore, the extent at which Xiao Yan could control it was far from being as flexible as Yao Lao. Moreover, the Spiritual Strength that had enabled him to be able to fight with a Dou Huang also completely belonged to Yao Lao. All of these were not of related to Xiao Yan. He had only played the part of a transferring point.</p>
 <p>Even the ‘Octane Blast’ did not have much effect on the ‘Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor’. Then the only hidden card that Xiao Yan was left with was that Di class Dou Technique: Flame Splitting Tsunami!</p>
 <p>Placing his palm gently on his shoulder, Xiao Yan’s finger touched the icy cold black colored huge ruler on his back. However, just as he was preparing to use this last hidden card, the corner of his eye abruptly stopped on the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ on his left hand. His mind was blank for a moment. After being quiet for a moment, a thought that was somewhat insane quietly began to excitedly rise from the deep regions of his heart without any restraint.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps, this will be even more terrifying…”</p>
