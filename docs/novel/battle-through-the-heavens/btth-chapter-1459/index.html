 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1459:</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>A figure flashed through the muddled-yellow lake with lightning-like speed. Flames lingered around the figure. Each time a flame made contact with the surrounding water, it would emit a series of sizzling sound.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed worthy of being the Nine Serene Spring. The dark and cold force that it contains is frightening.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body swiftly rushed toward the bottom of the spring. A solemn expression gradually surfaced on his face at the same time. The dark and cold force contained within the Nine Serene Spring seemed as though it could freeze Dou Qi. Xiao Yan still felt his limbs go numb even with his Heavenly Flame protecting him. The churning Dou Qi circulating around his body began to show signs of becoming sluggish.</p>
 <p>“Looks like I need to increase my speed. This is not a place I can stay for long!”</p>
 <p>Using the Heavenly Flame to resist the dark and cold force exhausted Xiao Yan’s Dou Qi. Although Xiao Yan had advanced to the Dou Sheng class and was able to control natural energy, the dark and cold force that filled this spring was unimaginable. Moreover, Xiao Yan was unable to control or absorb this energy.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body moved faster after this thought flashed across his heart. His speed soared once again as a deep water trail was created behind as he swam. The water only began to surge and refill after he passed, covering the trail he had made in the process.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Flame wildly leaped as Xiao Yan ventured deeper into the Nine Serene Spring. While he ventured deeper, the dark and cold force grew a couple of times over. In the end, Xiao Yan had to use all of his strength to circulate his Dou Qi and scatter the cold Qi that had invaded his body.</p>
 <p>“I wonder just how deep this Nine Serene Spring is. If this continues on, I can only turn around and head back.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at the bottom of the lake, which was completely dark. He slightly knit his brow. He needed to make sure he had enough Dou Qi for the journey back. The dark and cold force within this Nine Serene Spring seemed to possess a special Dou Qi erosion effect. If he was not isolated by the Heavenly Flame, it would have been difficult for Xiao Yan to reach this spot.</p>
 <p>“Hiss hiss!”</p>
 <p>A faint yet unusual sound was transmitted into Xiao Yan’s ear while he was feeling troubled by this Nine Serene Spring. He suddenly sensed the water behind him rapidly compress.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan suddenly threw a punch behind him when the flow of water increased. The frightening force on his fist used a special method to penetrate the water flow and ruthlessly smash into a black figure, blasting the figure apart in the process.</p>
 <p>“It is unexpected that there are living creatures in this Nine Serene Spring.”</p>
 <p>Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he glanced at the living creature. It had been blasted into a cluster of blood. The dark and cold force in this lake was such that even a Nine Serene Deep Ground Python could not endure for long, much less live in it for a prolonged period of time.</p>
 <p>“Hiss hiss!”</p>
 <p>Before Xiao Yan could dive again after blasting apart that black figure, he suddenly sensed more water had begun to fluctuate. A black fog quickly filled the edges of his sight.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression drastically changed upon seeing this black fog. It was not a true ‘black fog.’ Instead, this ‘black fog’ was made up of a countless number of strange black snakes with unusual scales. The hissing sound was being emitted from these strange snakes.</p>
 <p>“Chi chi!”</p>
 <p>These strange snakes widened their ferocious mouths while they were still a great distance away from Xiao Yan. Many deep-black water arrows shot out of their mouths. The lake water split apart when these water arrows touched it, causing the speed of the water arrows to increase. The buzzing sound of arrows rushing forward shook the surrounding lake water until it emitted a deep explosive sound.</p>
 <p>“What a dark and chilly energy…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced at the dark-black water arrows and frowned. These water arrows were similar to the dark and chilly force of the Nine Serene Spring, but they possessed an even greater destructive force.</p>
 <p>“A strange place will ultimately form some strange things.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan suddenly recalled the magma world under the Jia Nan Academy as this thought flashed through his heart. That underground world was populated by mysterious creature that no one in the outside world knew about. Moreover, there was an extremely frightening number of those creatures…</p>
 <p>“I must not get entangled with these strange things. Otherwise, I will exhaust too much Dou Qi…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body moved. His speed suddenly rose as he turned into lightning that tore through the lake. It quickly rushed to the bottom of the Nine Serene Spring, but those strange black snakes swiftly turned as Xiao Yan made made escape. They gave chase from all directions.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan swiftly unleashed his strength to the limit. Even though he was deep underwater, his frightening speed still created after-images along the way. These after-images were then penetrated by the tons of water arrows being shot over from behind.</p>
 <p>“What troublesome things!”</p>
 <p>These strange snakes continued to follow Xiao Yan like maggots in his bones regardless of how he increased his speed. Finally, his expression became chilly. His glanced behind before clenching his hand. A cluster of flames appeared in it. He then tossed the flames back before they soared. The flames turned into a fire cloud that spread apart.</p>
 <p>“Hiss hiss!”</p>
 <p>The fire cloud then spread into a sea of fire. Even though the dark and cold force could not be destroyed, those strange snakes still ended up colliding with the sea of fire due to them failing to stop in time. The high temperature incinerated all of the strange snakes that collided with it in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Hiss hiss!”</p>
 <p>Those strange snakes began to reveal a horror when they sensed this frightening fire. After a large group of them died, they finally stopped and did not dare to advance. They stayed back and continuously shot black water arrows from a distance to slowly extinguish the sea of flames...</p>
 <p>While these strange snakes were trying their best to extinguish the flames, Xiao Yan moved and hurried down. Finally, he shook them off.</p>
 <p>“This Nine Serene Spring is indeed not an ordinary place. Those strange snakes are not very powerful, but their dark and cold water arrows are too ferocious. Even an elite Ban Sheng would feel terrible if strike by one.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief after escaping those troublesome things. His eyes swept the area below, only to discover that a glow had appeared. He braced his attention and increased his speed. A moment later, he finally appeared at the glowing spot.</p>
 <p>“Is this the bottom of the Nine Serene Spring?”</p>
 <p>An extremely large sandy surface appeared in front of Xiao Yan. Countless fist-sized rock fragments lay on the ground. A luster was flickering from these rock fragments. The glow being given off was the reason why the bottom of the lake appeared relatively bright.</p>
 <p>“The Nine Serene Spring should extend deep underground. If I venture deep into it, even I will turn into ice…” Xiao Yan scanned the area as he slowed down. He began to search for the so-called Spring Blood Crystal, but he was surprised to learn that he wasn’t able to find any Spring Blood Crystal no matter where he looked.</p>
 <p>“There are no Spring Blood Crystals here. Could they have all been taken by the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression became a little ugly after his long search came to naught. He had spent a great amount of effort in order to arrive at this place. Would he have to return empty-handed?</p>
 <p>“Ah… rescue… me…”</p>
 <p>An extremely faint moan suddenly pierced through the water and entered Xiao Yan’s ears just as he was frowning.</p>
 <p>“Who?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression suddenly changed after hearing this faint voice. Dou Qi erupted from his body with a ‘bang.’ His eyes cautiously roamed around his surroundings. There was someone else down here? Why was it that he had not sensed anything?</p>
 <p>However, that voice completely disappeared when Xiao Yan focused his mind and waited for it. It was as though everything he had heard earlier was an illusion.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that I misheard?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly frowned. However, his heart understood that it was impossible to mishear things at his level. He lowered his head slowly and landed on the sand. After briefly hesitating, he suddenly clenched his hand in front of him,</p>
 <p>“Clash!”</p>
 <p>A palmprint formed on the sandy ground after Xiao Yan reached out with his hand. A thousand-foot-large metal chain was suddenly exposed to Xiao Yan’s eyes while the sandy rocks rolled.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes after seeing this extremely large metal chain appear. He grabbed with his hand and the metal chain was slowly pulled out. After which, the ground also began to shake before another three metal chains rose from the ground. These metal chains were connected to a mountain-like outcropping. It was impossible to move it with a tug.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes was unconcerned about where the metal chains connected to. His eyes stared at the middle of the four chains. There was a large cluster of black mud there…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his hand as he studied the cluster of mud. The mud was scattered in the process. The thing inside was exposed after the mud scattered. It was a person!</p>
 <p>A person whose body was dry and shriveled like a skeleton!</p>
 <p>“What a powerful aura this person has. It is likely an elite Dou Sheng whose strength has reached the third star. Why was he locked in this place?” Xiao Yan muttered. Shock flashed across his eyes as he looked at the skeleton-like human figure.</p>
 <p>“Save me, save me, save me and I will get the entire Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe to be your subordinate!”</p>
 <p>The shriveled human figure suddenly opened both of his eyes while Xiao Yan was looking over him. Those eyes were a little crazy as they stared at Xiao Yan. A hoarse roar rippled across the bottom of this spring. It appeared like the cry of a ghost, chilling one’s heart in the process.</p>
