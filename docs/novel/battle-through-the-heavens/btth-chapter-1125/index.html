 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1125: Pressure</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was solemn as he nodded. If this Cao Ying really possessed a relaxed character, it was likely that she would not like this kind of life while being on a high position…</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, but mister Xiao Yan need not be too afraid. That Cao Ying might be strong, but if you were to compete with each other, no one will know just who will come out on top as long as she has yet to reach tier 8. Unless she has reached this level, there is no guaranteed victory. Refining medicinal pills occasionally relies on one’s condition and luck. Everyone will meet with failure…” Ye Zhong hurriedly laughed. He thought that Xiao Yan was worried after seeing him descend into silence.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. Tier 8 and tier 7 were two completely different concepts. After all these years, it was likely that the only alchemist he had met who could refine a tier 8 medicinal pill was Yao Lao alone…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan had met some tier 7 alchemists after having arrived in the Central Plains region. However, he had never met a tier 8 alchemist. It was likely that even some Dou Zun class experts would need to be extremely courteous to an alchemist of this tier. They would possess a position that was similar to the height Yao Lao reached in the Central Plains back then.</p>
 <p>The reason why there were so few tier 8 alchemists clearly indicated how difficult it was to advance to this level. A tier 7 alchemist might be able to do extremely well in the Central Plains. However, if one wanted to reach the point where even an elite Dou Zun would willingly come to be your fighter, one would, at the very least, need to reach the eighth tier…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan withdrew from the thoughts within his heart as he smiled and said, “Relax, I will definitely do well in this Pill Gathering. I will do my best regardless of how strong the opponents are…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhong grinned and nodded upon hearing his reply. He said, “Mister Xiao Yan. The test of the five great clans will begin in less than one month’s time. We still need to leave for Holy Pill City in advance. Therefore, we must leave in around twenty days.”</p>
 <p>This pressing schedule caused Xiao Yan to frown. Immediately, he nodded. He was currently pressed for time, and he could no longer waste any. However, it was fortunate that his pill refinement training had gradually progressed well. Although he had yet to successfully refine a tier 7 high rank medicinal pill, his chances of success when refining some low and middle grade medicinal pills had significantly raised. With this speed, Xiao Yan sooner or later would be able to successfully refine a tier 7 high rank medicinal pill.</p>
 <p>“All you need to do is inform me before you leave. I will rest for one day before continuing my retreat and practicing hard for a period of time…”</p>
 <p>Even Ye Zhong involuntarily wiped some cold sweat off his face when he heard that Xiao Yan was going to continue his tortuous training. Pill refinement was an extremely tiring and troublesome matter. Based on common sense, it was impossible for even a tier 7 alchemist to refine pills all day long. After all, this was really too exhausting.</p>
 <p>This was originally the case based on common sense. However, Xiao Yan had not only been born with a powerful Spiritual Strength but he also had the help of a Heavenly Flame. This enabled him conserve his stamina when refining pills. Hence, if other tier 7 alchemists could at the very most refine three medicinal pills per day, Xiao Yan would be able to refine six, ten, or many more times the amount they could!</p>
 <p>In other words, his one day spent in bitter training was equivalent to training a couple of days by others. Of course, this kind of wild, uncontrolled training was extremely harsh. However, Xiao Yan had suffered many hardships during these years. He might not have anything else, but his character was tough after being honed all these years…</p>
 <p>The achievement that Xiao Yan possessed today was definitely not something that he had suddenly obtained!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhong felt some admiration for Xiao Yan after wiping off his cold sweat. He said in a solemn voice, “Ugh, mister Xiao Yan, please continue to train with peace of mind. You can just inform the old me if you do not have enough medicinal ingredients. Even if I have to exhaust the entire collection of my Ye clan, I will definitely support mister Xiao Yan until you have completed your training!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. He once again chatted with Ye Zhong about some matters related to the Pill Gathering before returning to his own room while the others returned to theirs…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan once again entered the Pill Refinement Room on the second day after having resolved the trouble that came with the Cao clan. After which, he announced that he would undertake a retreat to engage in harsh training. Soon after, an endless amount of rare medicinal ingredients were carried out of Ye clan’s warehouse, and they were piled in the Pill Refinement Room…</p>
 <p>Due to Xiao Yan having stepped forward, the Ye clan was temporarily no longer faced with any disturbances from the Cao clan. Additionally, the Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe would occasionally show themselves. This caused the factions coveting the Ye clan to hold back a little. Two elite Dou Zuns, this lineup was definitely not something an ordinary faction could contend with.</p>
 <p>Without the trouble that came from the outside world, the Ye clan became much quieter. Time gradually flowed by amid silence, appearing just like the sand seeping between one’s fingers...</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was due to the approaching Pill Gathering, but the entire Pill Region became unusually lively. Almost every part of the Pill Region was experiencing traffic that was larger than usual. Moreover, some more observant individuals would discover that various alchemists of different ascents from various places were beginning to appear within the Pill Region one after another. Clearly, these people were here because of the Pill Gathering…</p>
 <p>The Pill Gathering was not only a grand event in the alchemists world, but it was also a grand event for the Central Plains. Each time the Pill Gathering began, the Pill Region would become the focal point of the entire Central Plains region and sometimes even the continent. Countless numbers of people or factions would swarm over like hungry wolves who had smelled the fragrance of flesh…</p>
 <p>An alchemist was the most respected occupation in the Dou Qi continent. Everyone was envious of an alchemists’ abilities. Some alchemists might not be strong when it came to combat strength. However, that alchemist only needed to take out a small medicinal pill in order to get experts to fight on his or her behalf and take the other party’s life...</p>
 <p>Hence, everyone on the continent knew that it was best to avoid offending an alchemist, especially a high tier alchemist. This was because these people were like a beehive. The moment one touched a high tier alchemist, one would end up inviting an endless amount of trouble.</p>
 <p>A high tier alchemist was also someone some factions wanted the most. In order to get one of them under their wings, many factions would issue attractive offers. There were even some factions who would end up fighting until blood flowed like a river in order to snatch a high tier alchemist…</p>
 <p>The distinguished position of alchemists caused the Pill Gathering to be an exceptionally important occasion. Everyone knew that this kind of gathering would attract talented alchemists from across the continent. Those who could stand out among them definitely possessed a great strength. As long as a faction managed to recruit one of these alchemists, it would undoubtedly mean that their strength would rapidly soar…</p>
 <p>These were the reasons why so many people were coming to the Pill Region. Moreover, with the flow of time, this extremely vast Pill Region would likely fill with even more people who had come after hearing about the Pill Gathering…</p>
 <p>While the human traffic within the Pill Region was beginning to soar, the time of the five great clans’ test also approached…</p>
 <p>Everyone from the Ye clan respectfully stood outside of a Pill Refinement Room in the deepest parts of the Ye clan. The ones standing at the front were Ye Zhong, Xin Lan, and the few Ye clan’s Elders.</p>
 <p>Today was the last day before they would begin traveling to the Holy Pill City. It was also the day that Xiao Yan would finish his retreat…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not even take half a step out of the Pill Refinement Room during these twenty something days. The hot environment within the Pill Refinement Room caused even some of the members of the Ye clan, who had delivered medicinal ingredients, to be afraid of staying for long. Usually, they would gently place the medicinal ingredients down before hurriedly withdrawing in silence…</p>
 <p>Dark clouds would frequently gather in the sky near the backyard of the Ye clan during these twenty odd days. There was even some lightning gathering within the dark clouds a couple of times. However, the clouds would suddenly scatter just when a bolt of lightning was about to descend…</p>
 <p>This kind of change in the sky naturally attracted the attention of Ye Zhong and the rest. All of their hearts were a little shaken. They could clearly sense the surging energy ripple emitted from the sealed Pill Refining Room when the Pill Lightning was about to descend. This kind of energy ripple was extremely similar to the situation that appeared when some tier 7 high grade medicinal pill were about to take shape...</p>
 <p>Although they did not know why the surging energy ripple would suddenly disappear every time it reached a critical moment, all of them understood that this was something done on purpose by Xiao Yan…</p>
 <p>Regardless of Xiao Yan’s intentions, they were able to vaguely understand something. This period of bitter training seemed to have improved Xiao Yan’s pill refinement skill…</p>
 <p>“Creak creak…”</p>
 <p>While various thoughts quietly lingered in the hearts of Ye Zhong’s group, the tightly shut stone door was slowly opened. A great amount of heat immediately spread out from within…</p>
 <p>A skinny figure slowly walked out as the temperature rose. A moment later, he appeared in front of everyone’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>The skinny figure’s clothes were a little messy. His black hair was scattered around his head, and his face possessed a sparse beard. He looked quite miserable. Nevertheless, his dark-black eyes were unusually bright.</p>
 <p>For some unknown reason, Ye Zhong’s group vaguely felt that Xiao Yan was a little different from before, especially as they watched him walk out of the Pill Refinement Room…</p>
