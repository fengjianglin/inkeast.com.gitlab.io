 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1095: Three Changes!</u></strong></p>
 <p>Upon sensing the wild killing intent that surged out of Xiao Yan’s body, the eyes of the entire city carried some surprise as they looked at him. Tian She was also a little startled. Immediately, he thought about the change. It seemed that Xiao Yan should have some kind of grudge with the Hall of Souls since long ago…</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, not a bad killing intent. It is much stronger than the you back then, who only knew how to borrow the strength of others and act mightily because of it…” That black fog also rippled slowly when glared at with Xiao Yan’s blood-red eyes. Protector Wi’s cold laughter was immediately emitted.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s blood-red eyes stared intently at Protector Wu. It was a long while later before he inhaled a deep breath of air. His hands trembled as he suppressed the explosive fury and killing intent within his heart. His voice had also become a little hoarse due to his fluctuating emotions.</p>
 <p>“You deserve to die.”</p>
 <p>“Whether the old me deserves to die is not up to you as a younger generation to evaluate with such arrogant words.” Protector Wu smiled coldly and said, “The old me is even able to capture Yao Chen, much less you, this useless disciple.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was deadly. He waved his hand and the Earth Demon Puppet, which was emitting a bright-silver glow, flashed and appeared.</p>
 <p>A ripple rose around the black fog of Protector Wu when he saw the appearance of the Earth Demon Puppet. A surprised voice was emitted, “It is actually a puppet? It is unexpected that after so many years, you are still only able to rely on outside strength.”</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, Protector Wu, this puppet can match an eight star Dou Zong. However, you can rest assured that you can simply leave this puppet to the old me. All you need to do is capture this brat…” Tian She by the side smiled and spoke in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“In that case, I will trouble Elder Tian She. Relax, once I capture this brat, the old me will hand him over to Elder so that you can vent your anger properly.” Protector Wu laughed in a sinister manner after hearing his words. With Protector Wu’s current strength, he might not be afraid of this puppet, but it would be somewhat troublesome to deal with. He could save a lot of effort if Tian She were to intervene and restrain it.</p>
 <p>“Relax, I don’t require the puppet to deal with you.”</p>
 <p>Ridicule flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes. He could sense that Protector Wu had also become much stronger when compared to back then. Based on his guess, he should be around the level of an eight star Dou Zong. This training speed was quite great. From the looks of it, capturing Yao Lao back to the Hall of Souls had really benefited him.</p>
 <p>The strength of the current Protector Wu was only a little weaker when compared to Tian She beside him. However, just this alone was not enough to make Xiao Yan feel helpless. The person in front of him was the one he hated the most. If not for this person, Yao Lao would not have fallen into the hands of the Hall of Souls and suffered an endless amount of bitterness.</p>
 <p>“Your tongue is as razor-sharp as it was before…” Protector Wu faintly smiled. His foot immediately stepped forward. A clanging metallic sound was emitted from the black fog. Immediately, a black metal chain, with a black fog lingering over it, was extended from the black fog like a poisonous snake. It surrounded Protector Wu’s body. A cold glint was flashing on the tip of the chain.</p>
 <p>“Relax, you will be able to see Yao Chen again very soon. At that time, this protector will let that old fellow know that not a single person my Hall of Souls wants will be able to escape!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was cold and indifferent. A jade-green flame slowly surged out of his body. His hand was clenched and the enormous Heavy Xuan Ruler appeared. The heavy ruler was slightly inclined as it was pointed at Protector Wu. Xiao Yan said, “Your life will be taken by me today!”</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk…”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu merely laughed in a chilly manner in the face of Xiao Yan’s words. Black fog surged and the dark-black chain that lingered around him suddenly trembled. It immediately transformed into lightning as it shot straight toward Xiao Yan!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand tightly gripped the Heavy Ruler. His eyes did not contain even the slightest ripple. His feet were gently shifted as the black-colored lightning penetrated the sky, shooting toward to his shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>A jade-green flame lingered over the heavy ruler. Xiao Yan turned his wrist and the heavy ruler carried a hot fire glow and ruthlessly hacked at the chain. Under the high temperature of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, the strange, black fog, that lingered over the chain, swiftly disappeared…</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu was slightly startled as he sensed the enormous force being transmitted from the chain. Immediately, he let out a cold smile. His ten figures formed many afterimages. After which, one could hear wave after wave of the sizzling sound of rushing wind. Ten black-colored chains shot out of his body. They swiftly entangled in the air and formed a huge black chain spear!</p>
 <p>“Go!”</p>
 <p>A soft cry sounded and the enormous black-colored chain lance rushed forth in a lightning-like manner from the strange, black fog. It approached Xiao Yan within a flash!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes narrowed when the black-colored chain lance disappeared. His legs swiftly took a couple of steps back. After which, his heavy ruler suddenly drew a couple of mysterious arcs.</p>
 <p>“Six-Joint Body Flowing Ruler, Six Joint Fire!”</p>
 <p>Afterimages appeared as the heavy ruler was suddenly swung. A fire glow appeared on the top of the ruler. After which, it carried a sharp ruler glow and whizzed out!</p>
 <p>The ruler glow had just left the ruler when the space in front of it became distorted. An enormous chain lance broke through the air and revealed itself. It carried a frightening wind as it appeared in front of a countless number of gazes. Finally, it ruthlessly collided with that ruler glow.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A shockingly loud sound appeared. A vast, mighty energy ripple spread out in a ring-like fashion. A silver glow flashed under Xiao Yan’s feet as his body swiftly withdrew!</p>
 <p>“A mere two star Dou Zong dares to collide head-on with this protector. You are really seeking death!”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu gave a dense smile. The black glow on his finger flashed as it suddenly pressed against the empty air!</p>
 <p>“Split!”</p>
 <p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p>After Protector Wu’s voice sounded, the swiftly spreading energy ripple suddenly emitted the intense sound of splitting wind. Immediately, ten black figures suddenly rushed over like black-colored lightning. Their target was all the fatal spots around Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knit his brows slightly after sensing that his entire body had been locked onto. However, his great battle experience allowed him to avoid panicking. The heavy ruler in his hand danced and numerous ruler afterimages appeared in a densely packed manner, transforming into layer after layer of defenses.</p>
 <p>“Clang clang clang clang clang clang!”</p>
 <p>The black-colored chain shot against the ruler’s shadow defense from all directions. It immediately emitted a continuous clear sound. Sparks swiftly flashed. Under the ten black chain crazy attack, the spherical ruler shadow defense ball began to show signs of shattering in, forcing him to swiftly pull back.</p>
 <p>“This brat is nothing after having lost his puppet…”</p>
 <p>Tian She was suspended in the air by the side. He involuntarily let out a cold smile as he shook his head when he saw Xiao Yan being continuously defeated. Disdain flashed across his eyes.</p>
 <p>The layers upon layers of ruler shadows swiftly disappeared following the crazy attacks by the black-colored chains. By relying on his own strength, Xiao Yan did indeed have difficulty fighting against an eight star Dou Zong. Fortunately, his true fighting strength did not match the strength on his surface.</p>
 <p>When the final layer of ruler shadows disappeared, a bright silver glow surged out of his body. His body trembled and transformed into many afterimages that withdrew in a lightning-like fashion.</p>
 <p>“Swoosh swoosh!”</p>
 <p>The black-colored chains followed like shadows. Those afterimages had just appeared when these chains suddenly arrived and shattered them into nothingness. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan was faster than Protector Wu’s fighting speed after having used the Three Thousand Lightning Movement.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, is this the ability you relied on to come to the Central Plains region? It is a joke if you wish to rescue Yao Chen with this strength of yours!” A cold glint flashed across Protector Wu’s eyes as he looked at Xiao Yan, who was as agile as a monkey. He immediately emitted a cold, ridiculing laugh.</p>
 <p>The silver glow flashed through the sky, and Xiao Yan appeared a hundred meters away. He completely ignored Protector Wu’s hooting as he raised his head and revealed a ferocious smile to Protector Wu. The seal formed by both of his hands suddenly changed.</p>
 <p>“Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, First Change!”</p>
 <p>Following the formation of the seal, a green-colored flame suddenly erupted from Xiao Yan’s body before swiftly withdrawing again.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s aura suddenly soared when the green-colored flame shrank back into his body!</p>
 <p>“Secret Technique? Insignificant skill!”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu let out a dark, cold smile in the face of Xiao Yan’s soaring aura. He was completely unconcerned about it.</p>
 <p>“This is… the Burning Flame Valley’s Skyfire Three Mysterious Change?” Tian She by the side was slightly startled after seeing Xiao Yan use this technique. After which, he cried out in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Protector Wu, you should be careful. This Skyfire Three Mysterious Change is the top tier Secret Technique of the Burning Flame Valley. I do not know how it managed to land in this brat’s hand. If this Secret Technique is unleashed until the third change, his strength would at least be raised by three stars. However, those who can use this Secret Technique to the third change can be counted with one’s fingers even in the Burning Flame Valley…”</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, it’s only three stars. This is insufficient to allow this brat to escape this protector’s palm.” That Protector Wu coldly laughed when he heard Tian She’s words.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan acted as though he did not hear the conversation of these two. His face was indifferent. After which, his hand seal changed once again and a wave of invisible flame erupted from his body!</p>
 <p>“Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, Second Change!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s aura continued to soar after this invisible flame erupted. This time around, the expressions of even Tian She and Protector Wu changed. This was because Xiao Yan’s aura had currently already soared to the point where it was near the six star level!</p>
 <p>“This brat actually possesses two types of Heavenly Flames. No wonder he manages to experience such a great increase in his strength when he uses the Skyfire Three Mysterious Flame!” Tian She’s expression slightly sank. A Skyfire Three Mysterious Flames that consisted of two types of Heavenly Flame. This was something that even Tang Zhen from the Burning Flame Valley didn’t possess!”</p>
 <p>“No wonder he has the courage to come to the Central Plains. He does indeed possess a trump card…”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu spoke. However, his heart gradually felt a little uneasy. This Skyfire Three Mysterious Change had three changes. Xiao Yan had already reached the six star level after two changes. If he were to use it another time, would his strength not, at the very least, reach the seven star level?</p>
 <p>“It is rumored that each time a change of the Burning Flame Valley’s Skyfire Three Mysterious Change is used, the energy that is formed is extremely wild and violent. Even some of their Elders don’t dare unleash the third change. With this brat’s ability, he should have yet to reach that level…”</p>
 <p>Protector Wu felt a little relaxed after comforting himself within his heart. He was about to raise his head when he saw Xiao Yan on the opposite side changing the seal formed by his hands. His face instantly stiffened.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes stared firmly at Protector Wu as his black fog was rapidly fluctuating. The ferocious smile on Xiao Yan’s face was slowly widened. At the same time, a dense-white-colored flame suddenly erupted from his body in front of a countless number of stunned eyes!</p>
